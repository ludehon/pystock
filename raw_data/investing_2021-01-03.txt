Let's assume I have $50K cash and I want to invest it on a couple different ETFs (don't know many good ones so I'll leave that statement open). Below are the steps that I would take:

1. Invest every single week $400. Then, I will be DCA for a period of 120+ weeks ($50k divided by $400). Given the current market and the uncertainty, I think that is a good idea in the case things go south and the market starts performing poorly. This way you might miss some good returns but also you are more cautious for what can happen in the next two years approx. Making a big entry at ATH seems always risky to me.

2. During trading days where the stock market is down around 1% at the end of the trading session, I will invest an extra $200 in case there is a rebound on posterior days.

3. During trading days that the stock market drops more than 3% at the end of the trading session, invest an extra week worth of money ($400) to have a more aggressive DCA.

4. If a crazy sort of crack happens like the one in March, keep DCA for several weeks as long as the end of the trading session is in red. I consider this like buying at a discount.

What do you guys think about this strategy? If I had such amount of money, this is what I would do. Basically apply the concept of DCA and being more or less aggressive (like a dial) depending on how the market reacts at the current moment in time (therefore "timing the market")

Thanks In Advance!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Disconnected: Economy and Stock Market I have been apart of an university student run investment fund focusing on top down macro economic research leading into industry, sector, then company specific analysis as well and worked in 2 BB banks in the past. 

In the macro analysis, there are multiple trailing and leading indicators that are supposed to help display/predict the health of the economy (housing starts, unemployment, GDP growth, Real GDP growth,  GNP growth, ISM Manufacturing Index, Purchasing Managers Index, Beige book, Inflation, 2-10year T-Bill spread, etc.) These indicators can help gauge the strength or weakness of certain industries depending on how they react to the economy being in an expansion, peak, contraction, or recession. 

From there you can make the dive into specific industries and analyze their respective indicators to determine their strength or weakness with respect to the general economy for the next the year or so. And from there you can dive into specific sectors (consumer discretionary covers almost all retail stores but e-commerce is the sector within the consumer discretionary industry).

My question for all of you is how do we now research to best pick stocks? People have been saying how the stock market isn't connected to the overall health and strength of the economy. So with the economy still recovering and trying to get back to 'normal,' what do you all use to analyze companies that have significant upside or could be oversold?

Currently how it works they don't have a specific time which they execute the trade, but rather a window. In my mind this can be exploited by giving you the worst possible price in the trading window and pocketing the morning volatility. They may not always benefit, for instance if they bought at the high of the morning you get the stock at that price, but if they bought at morning lows and the stock jumps 3-4 percent in the next hour, there's nothing from saying they bought at or near morning highs and pocketing the difference.

This is different than selling orders flow to market makers and flat out an unprovable way to take money, if they are in fact doing that. 

Would be much nicer if the window of execution was very small, say 10 minutes or so, to prevent the possibility of this happening. On a flat day of the stocks you're buying it's not a big deal, but if you're buying on a day that the market moves big in the morning hours it can be a difference maker in the portfolio, especially if they combined that with selling order flow which they definitely do._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Adventures in Investing: In and out of $BYND stock and the dangers of YouTube hype So I had gotten all hyped related to Financial Education Jeremy’s 10x video on Beyond Meat, $BYND. I thought Beyond was an exciting company, and an interesting stock, and I had just seen the stock price drop after they reported Q3 earnings. But I hadn’t decided to buy the stock, and it looked like FEJ had and he got in at about the bottom after earnings. “He’s a genius!” I thought… So I liked his bull thesis, I added it to my watchlist, and I watched and watched and watched… and finally on a day it pulled back like 5% I got in! I was going to start building my position. And then it kept dropping. And on another day it finally got back to the price that FEJ had gotten it, so I doubled down! But then I started getting nervous. Why had they missed earnings? What reasons did they give? FEJ didn’t even talk about it in his video. Well I checked out their last conference call...

And then I found out. They missed huge. And the reasons they gave… because of “freezer stuffing” (I’m paraphrasing), during the grocery panic in Q2 related to Covid… customers didn’t buy as much in Q3, because they had already bought so much and they were storing it. Okay… Oh, and the reason that they didn’t “participate” in takeout was because restaurants had slimmed down their menus and didn’t include their products. Okay… Oh and they declined to issue guidance for Q4. So on the call you’ll see every time an analyst asks if they see their situation improving they would just reply “we are not issuing guidance at this time.” 

And then finally, there is this whole thing going on w/ McDonald’s, where they’re debuting the “McPlant.” Which was maybe a collaboration with Beyond, but they’re not publicly saying it… and Beyond wants their brand represented on the menu but McDonalds won’t even confirm that they are partnering with them, only that they had helped them test products at some point blah blah blah. 

So after learning all of this I thought it was pretty disingenuous of FEJ to not disclose these details in his video. To me it means that uncertainty and risk in Beyond stock is HIGH AF rn. Fortune favors the brave, so if you’re entering here and they turn things around, I think you could build a kick-ass position. But you need a reason to be faithful. Why do you think they’re going to turn it around in the near term? Because if they miss again, that stock price is going to fall again hard. Not to mention, you look at their financials and they are not currently profitable, and the stock is already being given a generous price multiple, etc. 

And finally, I was low on cash. And $BYND looks thirsty. IMO if you’re going to enter a risky stock, you gotta be ready to average down. You gotta have water. If you got no water then what you really want in the stock market is a cactus 🌵. So I’m out of $BYND stock for now. I also go out of $ABNB for similar reasons on the same day. Both interesting stocks and interesting companies and I hope to get back in at a later date. 

Happy new year!!!

worth the time_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Chinese local government investment vehicles evade borrowing limits: Move raises fears of bad debt surge after recent wave of bond defaults at state-backed companies https://www.ft.com/content/93bd1857-e488-4bb9-a2a0-b2e8841bfe40

Regional governments across China are evading borrowing limits by transferring assets on to the books of local investment companies to lower their official debt-to-asset ratios, according to executives and officials.

The practice has allowed local government finance vehicles to raise more money for infrastructure and other construction projects. But analysts warn that many of the assets are of poor quality, setting the stage for a surge in bad debts after a wave of bond defaults at government-backed companies in recent weeks. 

“Many of our assets do not generate much economic value,” Liu Pengfei, president of Taiyuan Longcheng Development Investment, an LGFV in the northern city of Taiyuan, said at an investment conference this month. “The Taiyuan government gave them to us so we can meet [the debt-to-asset] requirements set by our creditor banks and bond investors.”


TLDI used to focus on infrastructure projects. Now, it is a large, diversified operator of everything from parking facilities to tourist attractions, many of which are barely staying afloat.

According to public records, the total assets of 960 large LGFVs that regularly disclose financial results rose 40 per cent over the past four years. Their revenues and net income, however, increased just 6 per cent and 4 per cent respectively.

The bigger we are, the more we can borrow

An executive at a Yan’an City Construction Investment Corp
“A Rmb100bn [$15.3bn] company won’t be less likely to default on debt than a Rmb10bn one just because of a difference in size,” said Bo Zhuang, chief China economist at TS Lombard, a research group.

The surge in acquisitions looks set to continue as local governments look to LGFVs to boost the economy in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. The Shaanxi provincial government said in a statement in October that it would transfer “as many assets as possible” into LGFVs so they could double their borrowing over the next two years. The measure would “effectively eliminate government debt risks”, the government added.

“The bigger we are, the more we can borrow,” said an executive at Yan’an City Construction Investment Corp, another Shaanxi-based LGFV.

The executive said YCCIC has been given dozens of state-owned businesses by the Yan’an municipal government since 2018, ranging from hotels to water treatment plants. Most of them struggle to turn a profit.

Nevertheless, the executive added, YCCIC was able to borrow more because its bigger size had translated into a better credit rating, which was raised one notch to double A plus in October. Over the past two years, YCCIC’s outstanding bank loans have more than doubled.

Many local governments had previously given their LGFVs valuable land for free in order to boost their borrowing capacity. But the practice has been banned by the central government, forcing local governments to resort to transfers of lower quality assets.

Chinese banks, the biggest lenders to LGFVs, are comfortable lending to bigger government-owned investment companies even if their underlying asset quality is deteriorating.

“We have an obligation to support government-controlled enterprises as long as they meet the basic financing requirements,” an executive at Bank of Xi’an said.

Chinese state investors sound alarm on cash crunch after defaults
Rating agencies, on which LGFVs rely to gain access to the bond market, are also generally supportive. An executive at China Chengxin Credit Rating Group, one of the country’s largest, said the company was paying more attention to total assets than profits or cash flow. “The injection of government-controlled entities, whether they are profitable or not, into LGFVs is a sign of state support,” said the official. “That’s a plus for their credit rating.”

Some investors, however, are not convinced that the LGFVs’ acquisition spree will make them less likely to default.

“The expansion of LGFVs’ balance sheets won’t make credit risks go away,” said Dave Wang, a Shanghai-based fund manager who specialises in buying LGFV debt. “They may break out at a later date, on a bigger scale.”

Some LGFV executives said they were aware of the potential risks as they seek to build more market-responsive businesses.

An executive at Jiangdong Holding, an LGFV in the central city of Ma’anshan, said his group had acquired two smaller peers and wanted to emulate Temasek, the Singaporean state-owned investment group, even if it could not match its return on capital for the foreseeable future.

“Temasek has enjoyed an annual investment return of 16 per cent for many years,” he said. “We would be happy with 1.5 per cent.”_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Short-term downside to clean energy stocks The run-up in ev, battery, fuel cell, solar/wind companies will continue in the long-run, but right now, the safer bet is to hold investing in them until after the Georgia Senate runoff elections.

There have been many reasons why this is the case and it feels different to just being strong seasonality. Below are 15 ‘first time’ things to look out for in this sector to start the year with, with full credit going to John Quakes (@quakes99 on Twitter), a retired earth sciences researcher, professor, analyst, writer and one of the best public sources for news about the uranium sector. I share his view that 2021 will prove to be an incredible year for the uranium sector and subsequently for anyone invested in it. Now, onto the aforementioned ‘first times’: 

First time entering a new year with uranium already in a record supply deficit, which is set to deepen further with 2 major mines permanently closing this year in Australia and Niger (\~7 million pounds, gone). At the same time, demand for nuclear energy has remained strong throughout the COVID-19 pandemic and continues to grow in a global shift to decarbonize industry dependent on fossil fuels.

First time that Cameco, the world’s 2nd largest producer, has begun a new year with every one of its uranium mines in Canada shut down. Both of the world’s 2 largest uranium mines are under care and maintenance, resulting in zero lbs being produced in Canada as we enter 2021. The US is also producing zero lbs while Kazakhstan’s production is at a multi-year low that is likely to continue thru 2022 under the nation’s current flex-down program and pandemic related mining disruptions. All uranium mines in the Ukraine have also been shut down due to the inability of the mine operator to pay the wages of 5000 mine workers.

Fist time that at least 3 of the world’s largest uranium producers are forced into buying uranium on the spot market. Cameco is now the largest spot market buyer in the world. World’s largest producer Kazatomprom is now also a spot buyer, as is French Orano given that heir Canadian mills are suspended and their Cominak mine in Africa is heading for closure in March. Inventory held by the world’s largest uranium producers is at rock bottom levels for the first time ever and in need of replenishment this year.

First time the US has taken steps to support its domestic uranium mining industry by establishing a strategic uranium reserve, a 10 year buying program (1.5 billion dollars total) whereby the US government will purchase, convert and potentially enrich US mined uranium to create an emergency supply for US reactors. Goal is to ensure at least 2 US uranium mining companies remain active and viable during this time when the commodity price of U3O8 is half the cost of production.

First time in several decades that there is strong bipartisan support in the US to rebuild the existing nuclear energy industry and manufacture a new generation of advanced reactors on a global scale, which is seen as a high priority in order to catch up with Russia and China who have become the new world leaders in nuclear energy.

First time that uranium equities have entered a bull market when there is an actual supply deficit. The last bull market saw the price of uranium skyrocket on mine floods and other events that created the ‘fear’ of a supply deficit on the horizon, at a time when the US-Russia Megatons to Megawatts program was still continuing to supply 20m lbs per year to US nuclear utilities, a program that continued until 2021 as the world’s largest virtual uranium mine.

First time that a new year begins with spot market supplies significantly depleted. Supply accessible to carry traders has been severely reduced. Kazatomprom no longer sells any lbs into the spot market and Orano’s supply from Canada and Niger is at a record low level, pushing nuclear utilities to secure new long term contracts with producers rather than entering into shorter term contracts with carry traders. Security of supply is a top priority of utilities (whose inventories are estimated to be around 2,5 years’ worth of supply, when the guideline is to never let it drop below 2-3 years given the long time it takes to enrich and deliver the fuel to the reactors).

First time that US and European nuclear utilities have begun a new year with inventories drawn down below usual safety margins at the same time that mines supply is in a record deficit and global uranium production is at its lowest level in 12 years. The new 2020 IAEA/NEA uranium Red Book projects that secondary supplies will fall in the future as an overdue utility inventory restocking cycle begins, due to higher levels of contracting, conversion and enrichment that will reduce underfeeding as facilities see their utilization rates rise.

First time in several years that there are no geopolitical overhangs holding back the uranium contracting plans of US and European nuclear utilities. There are no potential section 232 actions targeting uranium imports and no sanctions likely against UUN participants (Russia, China, UK, Germany, France) in the JCPOA Iran Nuclear deal. Russia and the US have successfully negotiated a 20-year extension to the Russian Suspension Agreement that will see the US imports from Russia decline over the coming 2 decades. The incoming US administration supports keeping nuclear power plants running and plans to immediately rejoin the Paris Climate Accord, pushing for global net zero emissions by 2050, a process in which nuclear energy will play a major role.

First time that nations around the world will be recovering from a global pandemic with massive infrastructure spending programs that include boosting nuclear capacity to achieve net zero carbon emissions goals. A new ‘nuclear renaissance’ is beginning to take shape on pandemic recovery spending to boost clean energy. The perception of nuclear energy is also changing to that of a safe, reliable, necessary baseload power source that fits with an emerging ESG investing model. Decarbonization has become a new buzz word in the global vocabulary. The ‘electrification of everything’ from cars, buses, trucks and trains to major industry is the new global target. Sustainability of so-called renewables solar and wind is now being called into question after failures by Germany and California to successfully transition to an economy powered by intermittent energy sources. Higher electricity prices, no net carbon emissions reductions and rolling blackouts have demonstrated how ‘renewables’ are not able to fulfill their early promise. This might change with new battery technology and better implementation, but we are nowhere near that point yet.

First time that uranium stocks are entering a new year on the heels of one of their best performance years since the last bull market. The U3O8 spot price is still one-half the global average cost of production that will incentivize new mines to be built this decade. This signals to investors that we are still at the opening pitch of the first inning of a long game yet to play out. A necessary doubling of the U3O8 commodity price is yet to come.

First time that Canada has begun a new year embarking on a small modular reactors build-out program with several provinces pledging to deploy SMR’s to power remote communities, mines and industrial heat applications in the energy industry.

First time that nuclear is being viewed as the ideal carbon free high-temperature power source to produce clear hydrogen fuel. US, Russia, Japan and others are looking to leverage their existing nuclear power capacity to produce hydrogen and build high-temperature SMR’s to optimize the use of emissions free nuclear to produce zero emissions hydrogen.

First time in decades that there is an emerging surge in acceptance of nuclear  of nuclear energy as necessary to achieve zero carbon emissions goals, with countries like the Netherlands looking to add more capacity after conducting studies showing nuclear is safer and cheaper than variable renewable energy.

First time I can recall one of the leading nuclear fuel consultants UxC reporting to their subscribers that uranium is in a 57M lbs mined supply deficit, that utility and supplier inventories are “declining at a rapid rate” just as global fuel demand growth is accelerating, a clear signal that a bull market is getting underway.

TLDR: with all the catalysts that are in place, I am of the firm believe that uranium related equities, namely the developers and explorers, will offer returns that will outperform any other broad investment asset class/sector in the market. This is a bold claim to make, but I can’t see any other opportunity that offers even close to the same risk vs reward the uranium sector offers. Read my other posts on the subject to get an idea of what companies you might want to look at and to get an answer to any question you might have. Good luck and here is to a great new year!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ 10 Investment/Trading Ideas by UBS Analysts - Part 1! \*Long post warning\*

&#x200B;

**1. Long US Small cap over US Large Cap**

The significant underperformance of the Russell 2000 vs the S&P 500 since mid2018, and really since early 2014, has left investors wary about reallocating to small caps. We see a number of reasons to favour small over large:

* Small caps have outperformed after recessions. The Russell 2000 has outperformed the S&P 500 by 10pp-30pp in the year or so following the end of recessions (Figure 141). Additionally, our ISM cycle work also shows considerable outperformance of small caps in the early stages of a cycle. The depth of the COVID shock and likely solid recovery is a good set-up for small caps, in our view.
* Small cap earnings are recovering fast, with greater upside to 2022 earnings. Small cap (S&P 600) forward earnings estimates have recovered at an exceptional rate since the collapse in H1'20. Current NTM EPS estimates for small caps have caught up to S&P 500 forward estimates, normalised to expectations at the beginning of the year. Small cap forward earnings could rise 27% over the next 12mo+ if 2022 expectations hold – 9pp more than the potential forward EPS increase for the S&P 500. Importantly, earnings momentum for small caps is much stronger than for large caps. Small cap Q3 2020 EPS ended up beating consensus expectations by a massive 67% in aggregate, compared to a 17.5% earnings beat for the S&P 500, which was still a record.
* Small caps at \~12% discount to S&P 500, biggest since 2002. The S&P 600 small cap index is trading at 19.5x forward earnings, or a 12% discount to the S&P 500, which is the largest discount since 2002. Small caps have typically traded at a premium, given the many small firms that have negative earnings, so the current discount is \~24pp below the historical average. Additionally, the dividend yield for US small caps relative to the S&P 500 is still well above average levels, and points to further upside for US small caps over large caps.
* Vaccine sensitivities suggest small caps could outperform further. Small caps outperformed large caps by \~2pp on major vaccine news days, implying there could be significant further potential outperformance of small caps vs large caps on continued vaccine momentum and economies reopening.

**Tl;dr:**

* After past recessions, Russell 2000 outperformed S&P 500 by 10pp-30pp during the following year.
* Earnings momentum for US small caps is much stronger than for large caps, highlighted by the 67% aggregate Q3 earnings beat for small caps.
* Small caps are trading at a big discount to large caps despite better earnings momentum and higher expected growth into 2022.

**2. Long US Health Care over US Staples**

* Collaborating with UBS Healthcare analysts, we assessed the potential impacts of election scenarios for the key policy issues in detail. We see a Biden win and split Congress as a good outcome for drug pricing, ACA and other issues. We think progress on Healthcare policies via legislation is less likely, beyond must-pass items such as Medicare/tax extenders. Overall, lower policy risk should be reflected in many areas of Healthcare where policy was an overhang.
* Healthcare policy overhang is still priced. Healthcare is trading at a \~26% P/E discount vs the S&P 500, near a 30y high, with discounts within Healthcare subsectors also considerable for those segments exposed to regulatory risk. Thus upside could be notable as uncertainty fades. Within the Healthcare sub-industries, many of the affected areas are trading 15pp to 25pp below average relative discounts: Biotech, Pharma, HC Tech, HC Services, Distributors, Managed Care and Facilities. On the other side, Life Sciences, Equipment and Supplies are trading 15pp+ above prior average relative levels. Some of the relative repricing has likely been driven by the fall in interest rates – valuing growth more in a low-rate world. But some of the relative repricing likely also reflects the risks from the election.
* Managed Care and Hospital stocks have rallied 20% on average in the 6mo following elections. The anomaly is likely due to the large discount that typically gets priced in for regulatory risk, which eventually reverses as uncertainty recedes. The forward P/E for Managed Care going into the 2020 election was at a \~36% discount to the S&P 500, slightly greater than the average 33% discount. Hospitals show a similar pattern. Pharma in this election has also priced more risk, with drug pricing reform an overhang. We see further upside ahead for Healthcare as that policy risk re-prices and growth should remain solid, particularly relative to other defensive sectors.
* Healthcare is the preferred defensive, with upside vs Staples. On 2022 earnings, Healthcare is trading at a 23% discount to Consumer Staples, just above historic lows. Healthcare could lag in a recovery, but Staples have seen a pull forward in demand during the pandemic from the stay-at-home theme. Reopening and vaccine adoption would be a headwind to near-term Staples growth. Relative re-rating potential for Healthcare can provide upside vs defensives in a recovery.

**Tl;dr:**

* A Biden win/split Congress is a good outcome for drug pricing/ACA.
* Healthcare is trading at a \~26% P/E discount vs the S&P 500, near a 30y high. Within the Healthcare subindustries, many of the affected areas are trading 15pp to 25pp below average relative discounts.
* We see further upside for Healthcare as policy risk re-prices and with growth remaining solid.
* Reopening and vaccine adoption would be a headwind to near-term Staples growth.

**3. Long UK & Germany over Spain & Italy**

* UK: This year, the underperformance has accelerated. This underperformance has left relative valuations to Europe on P/E, P/BV and dividend yield all at, or close to, 20-year lows. And that extreme valuation discount is not due to just one or two sectors, but is actually widespread across the whole market. Out of 24 UK sectors, 18 currently trade on larger P/E discounts to their European peers than their 15- year average. Additionally, the UK has superior earnings momentum relative to Europe. We favour banks.
* Germany: Germany has the cyclicality and exposure to a global economic recovery. It is now cheap on both relative P/E and cyclically adjusted P/E. The dividend yield premium to Europe is near an eight-year high. Earnings momentum is above the rest of Europe.
* Spain: Spain has the weakest relative earnings momentum in nine years and is likely to see the weakest profit recovery into end-2021 – with earnings expected to still be 24% below 2019 levels. Our macro team also points out the relatively poor macro backdrop. Spain currently ranks 12th out of the 12 countries on our European country scorecard.
* Italy: Italy has underperformed, but only broadly in line with the relative earnings momentum deterioration. Additionally, we see only limited further tightening of the BTP-Bund spread – a key driver

**Tl;dr:**

* Both the UK and Germany have high cyclicality and cheap valuations relative to the rest in Europe.
* Spain has the weakest relative earnings momentum in nine years. Italian valuations re-rating exhausted along with BTPs.

**4. Long Korea over China**

* Korea, as a cyclical market (72% of the index) has tended to outperform in phases of industrial recovery, such as we expect in 2021. China, on the other hand, has outperformed in 2020 on the back of: (1) being first in and first out of the virus, and (2) having a relatively positive sector exposure that is skewed to 'new economy' sectors benefiting relatively from changing consumption patterns around the pandemic. What changes in 2021 is the ongoing shift to a global manufacturing recovery, while the delta on growth in China does not move to the same degree. On top of this, Korea is at the 20th percentile of its relative valuation range compared to China over the past 10 years.
* To some extent, this trade has shades of Value versus Growth, but in neither market are the Financials a large part of the index (8% in Korea, 14% in China), so in reality this is more about an industrial cyclical recovery compared with a tapering off in performance from 'new economy' stocks in an economy that has already largely recovered and opened up. Moreover, the largest stocks in China now face recent and unexpected regulatory headwinds, while we have a very positive view of the memory semi cycle, which plays into the largest sector by market cap in MSCI Korea.

**Tl;dr:**

* Korea to outperform through the 2021 industrial recovery. Korea's relative valuation to China is in the bottom quintile of its historical range.
* Strong memory semi cycle should help Korean IT trump China's internet companies exposed to regulatory risks.

**5. Long Europe reopening basket over North Asia reopening basket**

* While many Asia-Pacific countries have been lauded for their handling of the pandemic, this could potentially be a relative equity challenge in 2021. As vaccines become available, the incentive to open up is likely to be higher among populations where the virus is more embedded. Conversely, the threshold to open up borders in economies where the virus has been largely eliminated is likely to be much higher. Even as vaccines are provided to the most vulnerable in society, we think governments in economies where the virus is less prevalent will be less willing to open up at the same pace, having worked so hard to reduce transmission close to zero.
* This creates an interesting scenario where domestic mobility and global travel restrictions ease more rapidly in populations where the virus is endemic, compared to those in parts of APAC where virus management has been strict and effective (for example China, Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Australia, New Zealand).
* How to think about this in terms of equities? There are a few ways to play this. One is to go overweight the vaccine-sensitive stocks in Europe, versus the same group in Asia. In Europe, the sectors that have performed best on vaccine news are Healthcare Equipment, Construction Materials, Autos, Capital Goods, Transportation, Consumer Durables and Consumer Services. Many of these consumer-related sectors might benefit more from a more broad-based and international opening up, than the more domestic opening up that has happened hitherto in China.
* Figure 150 and Figure 151 show the relative performance and relative valuation (given cyclically depressed earnings, we use P/Book) of these sectors in Europe to those in Asia – the European sectors are considerably less expensive in relative terms compared to Asia, while performance has also suffered in relative terms.

**Tl;dr:**

* APAC economies that dealt with COVID-19 faster and more efficiently are likely to wait longer to fully reopen even as the vaccine is rolled out.
* In Europe, consumer-related sectors might benefit more from a more broad-based and international opening up. In China, the gains in those sectors might have run out of steam.

Thank you._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ How would you invest if you knew that food and water shortages are likely to happen in the near future? Hi,

In my country (Turkey), water supply of major cities are highly dependent on the rain and snow. In fact, whenever there is no snow during the winter, food and water shortages happen during the summer. It is January now and there has been no snowy weather which is really bad. I think it hasn't been this bad since early 2000s.

Generally the government tries to tackle these sort of issues by importing food but due to Covid I don't think that will work as well as it did in previous years. There are no elections in the near future and the economy cannot handle massive imports. So I am guessing the government will try to mitigate the issue until next year and will chose to suffer through this season instead of taking action.

How would you invest in this scenario?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ How do you discount future earnings in times of zero interest rates? Say you expect a company to make $100B dollars over the next 20 years. What is the value of that?
One might say it is $100B because interest rates are 0.

Not discounting future earnings would make companies extremely valuable. Usually, high P/E ratios are reserved for growth companies. But without discounting, even a company that does not grow at all would be well worth a P/E ratio of 1000. It just has to keep going for 100 years.

What do you guys think?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Why not front load and high fees? I’ve taken the standard advice of buying the index fund and letting it sit for decades and I have seen my these funds appreciate in low double digits on average over the past 6 years resulting in a doubling of holdings. But as I see a mutual fund like MSEGX with performance numbers of 115% in 2020 and an annualized 3-year return > 40%, I’m going to throw some in the portfolio.

But here’s the rub. I see the posts about avoiding front-loaded funds, and why pay 0.87% per year in fees, when most index funds have almost no fees. Well, I would do it for the ginormous return, of course. We’v seen a lot of shit in the past ten years, while the annualized ten-year return is 23% and it is a 5-star fund.

Hello you beautiful people

I’m very very thankful for this community. Quite new to this world so I’ve made it a goal to read a new finance book every 2 to 3 weeks throughout the entire year and educate myself.

Question is, what have been the books that helped you and you learnt from the most when it came to investing that led you to actual results? 

I’ve got my accounts all automatised as I’ve been reading Ramit Sethi’s ‘I will teach you to be rich’ book for the last 5 days now so I can move on from the ‘look at your expenses and streamline them’ stage. 

But now i’ve got start putting that money in different places, thats where my main question comes in. Books about investing? Or mindset around money? What were the books that you got the most value from that you’d recommend?

Reading a finance book every 2/3 weeks makes for 20 plus books this year :)

Unreal._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ North American Mega Cap Company HQs by Geographic Distribution and Market Cap Growth 2020-2021 With 2020 over, I decided to look at the regional geographic distribution of North America's "mega" cap corporations ($50b+ market capitalization) by headquarters.

Here's the graphic I made laying that out: [https://i.imgur.com/6vVxFCh.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/6vVxFCh.jpg)

North America has 152 mega cap companies, 145 in the United States and 7 in Canada. Mexico has 2 companies right on the cusp (Walmex at $49b and America Movil at $49b), but misses the cusp. Maybe next year.

These 152 companies have a market cap of $27.06 trillion. 97.7% is in the USA. 2.3% is in Canada.

To be clear, these companies are grouped based on the location of their headquarters, aka where high-level executive decisions are made (where CEO/President/Chairman/Board/executive management generally resides). Of course, these companies have multinational operations and their workforce is spread throughout.

Some thoughts:

* The U.S. gained $5.586 trillion in mega cap market value in the past year. Canada gained $97 billion. North America gained $5.683 trillion total.
* The West Coast had a banner year due to COVID pandemic and general inertia. With 56.6 million people (of North America's 580 million, or 9.8%) it is now home to 46 companies who combined have 52.4% of North America's mega cap market value. Last year, these 145 companies had a market cap of $21.4 trillion, and the West Coast had 42.4% of the share. So the West Coast captured 10% of the mega cap "market share" in one year.
* Mega cap market value increased by 26.79% in the United States and 18.34% in Canada. In both cases, the increase was due to tech growth. In Canada, Shopify's growth alone makes up nearly the entirety of Canada's growth. Shopify went from not being mega cap ($46b) on January 1, 2020, to having a market cap of $137 billion a year later, or 198% growth. If you exclude Shopify from Canada's listing, Canada's mega cap only grew by 1.24%, showing how countries without competitive tech industries will fall behind in the coming decade. If Shopify can continue to grow in the coming years, it will do wonders to shift Canada's mega cap value away from dying (energy) and stagnant (finance) industries.
* The same tech shift was noticeable throughout the U.S. The West Coast's mega cap market value increased by a whopping 52.9% from $9.067 trillion to $13.863 trillion. Tesla alone added $593 billion of market capitalization, or nearly the entire mega cap value of Canada. The rest of the U.S. had mixed growth. The Great Lakes and Southeast had 12.75% market cap growth and 12.80% market cap growth, respectively. The Northeast, heavy on traditional industries and finance, only grew by 4.56%. The Southwest declined by 5.32% due to the oil shock and Exxon's market cap collapse.
* Of the 7 North American companies among the Top 10 globally, we have the following growth:
   * Alphabet: +$264 billion market cap growth
   * Amazon: +$714 billion market cap growth
   * Apple: +$968 billion market cap growth
   * Berkshire Hathaway (the only non-tech): -$8 billion market cap growth
   * Facebook: +$193 billion market cap growth
   * Microsoft: +$482 billion market cap growth
   * Tesla: +$593 billion market cap growth
   * **TOTAL: +$3.206 trillion**
* As the numbers above show, the 7 companies above grew by $3.206 trillion. So these 7 alone account for 57.4% of the U.S. gain, and 56.4% of North America's. They also account for 67% of the West Coast increase just due to sheer size, even if smaller tech companies had much better percentage growth rates than all but Tesla.
* Two companies IPOd straight into mega cap territory: Airbnb and Snowflake. Both are seriously overvalued and I can't imagine them sustaining those levels.
* If 2021 is a year of recovery, I could also see a correction, with money being pulled from the safety of big tech back into traditional industries. So next year's snapshot might be far less imbalanced than the +53% West Coast, +5% Northeast dynamic we had this year.
* HQ relocations are a big question mark. This year alone, Charles Schwab and Oracle moved their HQs to Texas (though the former's isn't final final until January 21). If Paypal or Tesla move to Texas in 2021, the West Coast dominance could be reduced even further.

I think the topic for today's discussion is probably the single most important one for all of us, as the answer to the question would determine whether we should even trade in the markets at all.

Why would we ever trade individual stocks, commodities, or other assets if we can't actually "beat the market"? The market meaning the S&P 500 index or the Dow for those based in the US.

I know this will likely spark lots of criticism and intense discussions. I know a person who publishes investor letters has even gotten a death threat for saying something in his newsletter, also the reason why I'm staying private and anonymous.

Therefore, let me preface it with a few points first.

\- This is solely my personal opinion.

\- Your opinion is just as good as mine.

\- Full disclosure, I haven't worked as a portfolio manager at an institution so I certainly lack lots of experience in managing money compared to those who make a living out of managing pension or endowment money.

\- It's completely fine if you disagree. My goal is not to convince you but to help provide resources for people. The more you know the better.

\- I believe that an "average person" would be far better off investing in the market index, just as Warren Buffett said.

\- I agree with the academics, investors, and communities that most people shouldn't try to beat the market as most simply don't have enough time to analyze and monitor companies or have the discipline to stay invested in their ideas.

\- Investing is a game of probability, just like poker. This fund is "more likely" to beat the market means the fund has a high chance of beating the market, not "will" beat the market.

If you have a pair of aces in a poker game, you wouldn't necessarily win the pot but you have a "high probability" of winning the pot.

People say poker is a game of luck but there are professional poker players who win over a period of time. I believe the same is true in investing. Not necessarily "professionals" but any investor can beat the market with the right amount of discipline and research.

\- Timing the bottom or top is impossible. But it is possible to guess the top or bottom with a probability. For instance, at the end of 2019, was it more likely that we were near the top of the market cycle or bottom? The answer is obvious.

Now with all that said, I'll say the unpopular opinion.

Yes, we can "beat the market".

More specifically, I believe it is possible to beat the S&P 500 net of fees even over a long period of time, say 20-30 years, for those with less than $50 million in the portfolio.

Here are my arguments for today's topic.

**1) It is possible to beat the market with a small portfolio as an individual investor.**

**2)** **While it is possible to beat the market as an individual investor, two traits are essential for an investor to win. They are discipline and conviction.**

**3) Security analysis doesn't require a rocket scientist. For instance, it's not hard to know e-commerce, EV, and cleantech will be the future.**

**1) It is possible to beat the market with a small portfolio as an individual investor.**

But beating the market isn't enough. You have to consistently beat it, for 5 years, 10 years, and 30 years.

I'm sure most of you know that a 1% difference in the 30-year annual return can make a huge difference at the end of the 30-year period due to compounding.

What most probably don't know is the distribution of those returns from a portfolio point of view.

If you make an annual rate of 15% return over the course of 30 years, that doesn't mean you need to make 15% of return every single year in practical terms.

What's happening is that over the course of 30 years, you will make 200% returns, 100% returns 60% returns in the early part of the 30 years, and then slowly decline to 5% annual returns, which altogether make 15% annual return over the course of 30 years.

Theoretically, any investor's portfolio will look something along the lines of this over a time period.

📷

The total compounded annual return is 15%, not the actual annual returns.

This makes sense because, with a $50k portfolio, you will obviously be more concentrated in positions compared to a $50MM portfolio. Therefore, you are taking more "risk" in a smaller portfolio.

Similarly, Berkshire Hathaway, the conglomerate run by Warren Buffett, has posted annual returns that look somewhat similar.

📷

If you noticed, the standard deviations are much larger in the earlier part of the years compared to the latter part of the years when the portfolio simply got too big to take that much risk.

In fact, the standard deviation of the returns for the first 20 years is 42% compared to 16% in the last 20 years.

**Where I'm getting at is it is much easier to beat the market by a wide margin with a small-sized portfolio than a large portfolio and therefore, retail investors have a good chance of beating the market, given an appropriate knowledge and discipline.**

It may be common-sense but to reiterate, it is much easier to double a portfolio of $500k than to double a $50 million.

You may think the reason is that you're taking larger risks on smaller portfolios than larger portfolios.

It is true that risks are larger. However, it also depends on how you define "risk".

Standard deviations are obviously larger in a smaller portfolio since your absolute size is smaller and therefore, you can't diversify as much.

But standard deviations aren't truly the "risk" of a company going under. The true risk of a company going bankrupt is the liquidity, cash flow, and business profile. Even with a concentrated portfolio, I believe it's possible to get large returns with limited "risks" as retail investors.

Now, to reduce those idiosyncratic "risks" of businesses, we need to apply our "knowledge" and "discipline".

Which brings to my second argument.

**2)** **While it is possible to beat the market as an individual investor, two traits are essential for an investor to win. They are discipline and conviction.**

Most people will sell at lows and buy at highs. We sell at lows because once a stock goes down, our cognitive bias kicks in, called the loss aversion bias. We put more weight on losing $100 than gaining $100 and thus, losing money has more impact on us than gaining money.

This is due to evolutionary psychology and there's a good reason why we were evolved this way but that's a topic of conversation for another day.

We also buy at highs because we tend to follow the herd, getting into the hype of trends and manias. Fear of missing out (FOMO) is a strong incentive for people to get in on the EV hype.

People at cocktail parties will brag about their 4x returns on bitcoin or Tesla, which will prompt you to buy them the next day.

Buying at highs and selling at lows are due to a lack of discipline, as the famous investors put it.

This is also the reason why professionals say "invest in what you know". If you invest in what you don't know, then you will be tempted to sell when stocks go down because you don't know the company and don't have such a high conviction that it will recover.

As an analogy, I have seen many people make new year's resolutions as losing weight or saving more money to buy a house.

Why is it so hard to do both?

In fact, all of us actually know how to lose weight: eat less and exercise more. Burn more calories than you consume. It's as simple as that.

We also know how to increase the balance on our bank account. Spend less than what you earn, or increase your earnings through side-gigs.

It doesn't take a genius to figure out the solutions to these problems. I believe the same is true for the markets. People generally know which companies will be better off in ten years (Disney, Amazon, JP Morgan, etc.).

So why do people lack the discipline to stick to their plans?

Again, there's a good evolutionary reason which I won't get into in this post.

If Amazon fell 30% today and stayed there fore the next month or two while other EV companies rose 50% in the same time period, most people would be tempted to sell their Amazon and buy those EV companies, hence the "sell low buy high" phenomenon.

Take this analysis shown on WSJ.

**The returns of a hypothetical investor who put $10,000 into an S&P 500 index fund at the start of 1980 and missed the market’s five best days through the end of August 2020 would be 38 percentage points lower than those of someone who stayed invested the whole period, according to a Fidelity Investments Inc. analysis.**

This is the significance of self-discipline, the ability to weather through the tough times, or carefully ride the trends.

To gain self-discipline, we need a high conviction. To have a high conviction, we need to do enough research and have a sufficient understanding of the assets we are buying.

As long as we understand that this company will thrive with a high probability, we will more likely to hold onto those positions even in a recession.

**In order to beat the market as an individual investor, we need self-discipline. Self-discipline comes from a high conviction. High conviction comes from enough research and understanding of the security.**

**Security Analysis leads to -> High Conviction leads to -> Self-discipline**

**3) Security analysis doesn't require a rocket scientist. For instance, it's not hard to know e-commerce, EV, and cleantech will be the future.**

I'm certainly not saying analyzing individual companies is easy but as an individual investor who lacks the resources and knowledge about a company, it's still possible to know that a company is a fundamentally strong business trading at a reasonable multiple.

For instance, Fiverr is an Israeli company that allows freelancers to offer their services on its platform. It has grown its sales at more than 40% annually with at least 75% gross margin. Would you expect this sort of company to continue growing in the next five to ten years or go bust?

And yes it's trading at too high of a multiple, at 43x LTM P/S.

But think of it this way. If Fiverr grows its sales at 40%, 40%, 30%, 30%, and 30% in the next five years and has a 25% net margin, it'll have $175MM in net income after five years. With a trading multiple of 70 P/E you get $13B market cap in five years, compared to $6.8B market cap right now.

Yes, these are rosy assumptions but I don't need to convince people that a platform with freelancers will only grow in the future.

Many also argue that you can’t win in the market because there are too many big-money professionals and the person on the other side of the trade knows better than I do.

I absolutely agree with that. But it's not a winner-takes-all game.

There doesn’t have to be a single winner. Professional trader's win doesn't mean our loss.

You don’t need those terminals and market data to predict that the stay at home stocks would have outperformed the value stocks since March.

You don’t have to be a genius to know that China will be the next big player in the world or that Chinese companies are poised to outperform maybe some other foreign competitors.

The important aspect to remember is that the retail investors can easily come to the same conclusion as a professional analyst who has spent thousands of hours on research.

The key differences between the professionals and us is the amount of work the professionals put in and the vast amounts of resources they have, both of which lead to higher conviction (therefore, self-discipline) and informational advantage.

That’s why people like Peter Lynch and Buffett likes to say invest in what you know.

By only dealing with what we are familiar with (easy-to-understand companies), we don’t need to use CapIQ or Bloomberg to come to a high conviction that e-commerce will only grow in the future.

If however, we were to take a stab at a company like Exxon Mobil, we need to know how much of their production volumes are hedged, at what oil price are their rigs economical, how will commodity prices impact the stock performance (you need historical correlation data and regression for different time periods), and so on.

Take bond futures. It’s not that hard to know that as long as the Treasury is issuing more than the Fed is buying, there will be a supply overrun and yields will likely go up (of course it's not as simple as that because you need to take into account numerous other factors like inflation and real yields but I'm making a point here). But I only can monitor that from the numerous data points provided by the sell-side research.

The more complicated analyses are where professional investors have an edge.

**To summarize today's post in one sentence, it is possible to beat the market with a small-sized portfolio given a sufficient amount of discipline.**

Please feel free to use this post as a starting off point when arguing with your friend about beating the market.

Data Source: CoinMarketCap_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Fluor a possible Turnaround with Growth Potential  Hi guys I originally posted this to r/wallstreetbets but I thought you would appreciate it to so here it is

\*\*\*\*\*Please note I own stock in this Company this is not investment advice its just a research dump invest carefully!\*\*\*\*

**Overview**

Fluor is a Fortune 500 Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) company headquartered in Irving Texas.  Fluor corporation has approximately 45,000 employees worldwide. The company operates in 6 segments, Energy and Chemicals, Mining and Industrial, Infrastructure and Power, Diversified Services, and Other with one additional segment being reported as discontinued operations.

**Fundamental** **Problems**

Fluor has multitude of issues that have threatened the very survival of the company. These issues have caused the market cap to crater from 8 Billion in 2018 to 2.25 Billion. The most critical problems are summarized below. This is by no means a complete list. For the sake of length, I have omitted some of the less critical issues. We must also note that there may also be other problems lurking as well.

* Improper bidding, cost overruns and restructuring have led Fluor to report a 1.5 Billion loss with approximately 300 Million in asset impairments.
* There are 16 loss contracts that have been improperly negotiated and must be completed at zero margin.
* Weakness in oil Demand has led Flours customers to reduce capex spending in the Energy & Chemicals segment which comprises 40% of Fluor’s revenue.
* Fluor has had major accounting problems which have spawned a SEC & DOJ investigation.

**Liquidity**

Fluor has $2 Billion in cash, $5 Billion in current assets and $7.2 Billion in total assets. This compares to $3.5 Billion of current liabilities with total liabilities of $6.0 Billion. I believe due to Fluor’s strong cash position they have ample liquidity to meet all their near-term obligations. Furthermore, while substantial I believe their debt is within reasonable ranges. Fluor is selling an equipment rental business to allow them to “Modestly” reduce their leverage and raise more cash, further improving liquidity.

**How Fluor Is Addressing Their Problems**

While Fluor’s issues are critical, I believe that management is successfully addressing these problems.

Fluor’s improper contract negotiation stems primarily from their Lump Sum contracts. Essentially this mean that Fluor gets paid in a lump sum at the project completion. This is problematic because it means Fluor must wait until completion of the project before being paid. Additionally, any cost overrun or delay is completely absorbed by Fluor. In order to prevent anymore loss contracts from entering their backlog Fluor has stopped negotiating lump sum contracts opting for more traditional contract negotiation approach and thus protecting the future backlog from more loss contracts.

Despite a net loss of 1.5 Billion, Fluor has generated operating cash flow of $219 Million with Free Cash Flow of $38 Million. This operating cash flow will continue to give Fluor a buffer to complete their loss projects while even increasing their cash balance. As Fluor finishes these projects their operating cash flow and free cash flow will continue to climb higher.

The weakness in revenue for Energy and Chemicals should also begin to slow as some EPC work for regular Maintenance is necessary to maintain oil and gas infrastructure. Furthermore, if emission standards become stricter this could spur demand as refineries increase CAPEX to upgrade their facilities. Finally, I expect the chemicals portion of this business to continue to drive adequate performance as we do not have any viable alternatives to Petro-Chemicals yet.

On the accounting side Fluor has unfortunately discovered that there were problems with their Internal Financial Controls and revenue recognition. These issues have been corrected but I think it is safe to assume that Fluor has significant liability with potential SEC & DOJ lawsuits. However, despite this I believe the lawsuits, while expensive, likely will take years to resolve and considering Fluor’s strong cash position they will most likely will be able to pay the fine.

**Impact of Reasonable Adverse Development's on Fluor's business**

In order to establish Safety of principal we must consider a few possible adverse conditions that can arise and the impact on Fluor's business. 

* More loss contracts, This would be a very poor outcome for Fluor but I believe that even with more loss contracts Fluor would still generate enough cash to meet all their obligations. in a worst case scenario Management could also continue to sell more assets in order to raise more capital to fund the loss contracts.
* Major Global Economic Recession, This would be mostly bad for Fluor but its possible they could actually benefit from fiscal stimulus and projects designed to spur demand in the Economy. They also have a backlog of projects so a major drop in (edit: profitability) wouldn't immediately occur in a recession. Rather they would have a little bit of time to figure out what to do.
* Prolonged Depressed Oil Prices, This is a pretty likely scenario thankfully Fluor has expertise in many different industries and can continue to drive growth in these areas. While over exposed at the moment they are not solely dependent on Oil and Gas.

**Major Growth Opportunities**

These ideas below are the most exciting and compelling reason to look at investing in Fluor.

Fluor’s Mining & Industrial segment constructs & maintains mines globally. As demand for precious metals increase due to a transition away from fossil fuels, precious metals for batteries could take the place of Oil. This includes lithium, nickel and cobalt Fluor has prior experience with these materials. Mining already comprises about 35% of their revenue and has been profitable and a major pillar of stability in Fluor's business. (Although Covid has Delayed some new contract awards in this segment)

Fluor’s Energy & Chemicals Business has built off shore wind farms, carbon capture, bio-fuels and hydrogen infrastructure. All infrastructure currently being looked at to mitigate or solve the climate change crisis. This area will be competitive but Fluor does have its own IP it can bring to the table and compete with. If there is a major jump in demand in the coming years Fluor is certainly capable of winning some construction work in these areas.

Some other miscellaneous things Fluor engages in is nuclear decommissioning, managing the U.S strategic oil reserve, Building automobile & Pharmaceutical factories and Data center construction.

And then there is the crown jewel NuScale, a company planning on building the First small modular nuclear reactor (SMR) in the United States. Fluor is the Majority investor in NuScale and is the exclusive EPC contractor for NuScale. Recently the U.S Nuclear Regulatory Commission certified NuScale’s one-of-a-kind design. The U.S Department of Energy has also awarded NuScale’s first customer $1.3 Billion in cost sharing to build the first reactor Idaho. Interestingly the United States International Development Finance Corp also lifted a ban for the financing of nuclear projects and has also signed a letter of intent to support NuScale. This will likely be a $1 Billion dollar loan South Africa in order to build a NuScale SMR . There are many other interested parties both inside and outside the U.S including Canada, Romania and the Czech Republic. The applications of this technology are wide ranging. Electricity production is a primary use, however other uses include desalination for clean drinking water and using the excess heat produced by the reactor to create cheap carbon free hydrogen.

**Basis for Investment**

In the near term I believe Fluor can successfully complete a turnaround restoring most of their business segments back to reasonable profitability. In 2017 Fluor generated 318 Million in Free Cash Flow. Assuming Fluor completes their restructuring and finishes the loss contracts I see no reason why Fluor cannot return to at least 250 million in annual free cash flow. This FCF is 11% of Fluor's Total market cap and by itself presents a very attractive return for an investor. Simultaneously Fluor’s should be able to shift their construction focus away from oil and gas to new areas that are growing increasingly important. The low barriers to entry are both a blessing and curse in this regard. That brings me to NuScale which oddly seems as though it’s being adopted by the U.S government as some strange foreign policy play. While it remains a longshot in my view the combination of the DOE grant and the potential DFC loan is 2.3 billion a big positive. This is equivalent to the entire market cap of Fluor and shows the scale of the opportunity. Furthermore, Fluor currently has no competitors in this market so margins should be significantly higher. I believe Fluor will complete a successful turnaround likely bringing the stock back to 4 Billion and restoring the dividend. In the Long-term the company could even hit new all-time highs however I’m not entirely confident on putting an exact figure on that just yet.

TLDR: Fluor is struggling construction company, but I think the company can pull off a successful turnaround. That coupled with expanding their existing non-oil revenue and the NuScale wild card could send the stock from $16 to at least $30 and possibly beyond $80 (its all time high) since its a very compelling growth story.

Also sorry if there's a lot of awkward phrasing or poor grammar I have a learning disability lol. (actually though)

Here's a breakdown of why we're likely not anywhere close to 2000 levels of craziness.

**First:**  During the dot-com era, the Nasdaq Composite's price-to-earnings valuation ran up as high as 200. By comparison, the index's P/E today is a relatively tame 28, only modestly higher from 23 at the end of 2019. 

**Second:** Interest rates were a very attractive 6% which provided a strong alternative to stocks. No such outlet exists today unless you trust bitcoin, or want to invest in paper gold.

**Third:** Much of the value gains we're seeing in the market can be tied directly to the fact that people who invest are making similar or better money this year, and spending significantly less causing them to save more and invest more:

[https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/01/upshot/why-markets-boomed-2020.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/01/upshot/why-markets-boomed-2020.html)

**Fourth:** The rest of the growth can largely be attributed to increased liquidity from all of the money printing. Stocks tend to mirror an increase in the money supply with their value making them a great hedge against inflation. The valuations of the 2000s weren't backstopped by QE or increased savings, making them much shakier.

**Fifth:** The money printing will likely go on for a while. People mistakenly assume we're printing against our 22T dollar economy when we're really printing against the 80-100T global economy for which are the reserve currency. A weak dollar benefits the global economy, and benefits us because we are the trading floor for the global economy.

This is a long but very illuminating read on why QE is necessary and actually helpful:

[https://www.lynalden.com/fraying-petrodollar-system/](https://www.lynalden.com/fraying-petrodollar-system/)

**My Take:** There are a few stocks that are out of control with their valuations (Hi TSLA!), and a few sectors that are overvalued, but overall the market looks to be on sturdy ground with the increased savings, and the increased liquidity. There will be peaks and valleys, but I think there's a lot of room to grow, especially once the vaccine is widespread._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ In looking for "THE Perfect" indicator. I've had it on my chart before, can't find it Google searching. I once came across an indicator that plotted a channel on the candle chart, and this channel looked somewhat like a sine wave because of how smooth it was.

Price always bounced "perfectly" off the top and bottom of the channel. It was like clockwork.

I think it used regression calculations to back fit the lines that price would bounce off of.

For real live trading it's totally worthless as the indicator lines dynamically fit the data.

I seem to remember that scrolling to zoom a little bit would cause the line to "scroll" and adjust as you were looking at it. It always fit the data that was displayed on the chart.

Basically, screenshots make it look like the perfect indicator, but seeing it on a chart helps you to realize that it's really of no use.

I saw someone trying to sell this indicator as a ninja script or MT script or something, but I've found it for free on TradingView.

I need this indicator for a special project.

As we step into 2021, this year I want to start learning how investing works. I live in Canada, currently studying finance at UFT. So if this post is in the wrong community, please let me know and I’ll post in the correct one.

My goal this year is to start passively investing. I do have a bit of background knowledge on how investing works (studied courses at UFT). I have never invested before, not even in a mutual funds which banks recommended. Therefore, I was hoping that the community could advice the best steps to take for new investors. How should we start the process? Books that are beneficial? Which trade account to use for stock investments? Etc.

Thank you for all of your help!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Is it worth it to invest in 2021 with the inflated bubble territory stock values? I haven't invested since August, and their haven't been any dips in the market since early November. Even then, it was a small dip and the market shot up 800 points or so for the next few days. The market also seems to not be making any sense because every time the unemployment numbers are increasing the market shoots up.

It's mainly due to injections of liquidity from the fed reserve. But, at some point the house of cards has to fall. A lot of these companies that are going up are IPOs that solely went up because of niche markets that would not have been as big if the coronavirus had not have happened ex: peloton, zoom, some cloud stocks etc. Now it's hard to even find a stock under $100 because the whole market has been overflooded with newby investors, liquidity, and activist hedge funds that are trying to keep retail and manufacturing relevant that is keeping the blue chip stocks propped up as well. 

With that said, at these prices is it still worth it to buy a couple shares of these overvalued firms like Zoom, Netflix, Amazon, Peloton, Tesla etc. 

Look for another IPO that may or may not go up? Draft Kings, Air bnb, Snowflake, beyond meat, rackspace, etc

Or just wait it out logically like Buffett used to say in one of speeches be patient and only buy something if you know you can hold it for 10s. However, the more I feel I'm waiting the more I feel like I'm just letting my money sit doing nothing and I'm losing out on opportunity cost. These values just make no sense though, and every IPO that comes out sees even higher percentage gains than the one before it. The regular blue chip stocks that are steady like Microsoft, Visa, Proctor and Gamble, Walmart etc that seem like the best companies profit, revenue, and management wise don't rise up in value near as much as some poorly invested startup IPO in a niche market that has negative earnings every quarter. It just makes no sense. 

So, basically is it still worth it to invest in 2021, or should we all just sit out and wait for it to drop like how much higher can it go?  
And if so what makes for better investments in our current times blue chips that are less worrisome, tech companies, solar/renewables, or IPOs?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Thinking of upgrading my brokerage from Robinhood and Sofi Invest to a more official account I have been investing into these accounts for a couple of years and I have heard about other accounts but I was hoping to get some suggestions on which one would be worth opening an account with. 

What I have liked about Robinhood has been able to invest a daily $1 with ease, unlike Sofi Invest I have had to manual set a buy order for each day I want the automated transaction to occur. 

What I like about Sofi Invest I have been able to invest under $1 or 25 cents into some stocks, but I dont expect to be doing that.

Should I just consolidate on both of these apps? Or could I have benefits from making the switch?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Benefiting from the trending negative interest rates According to [some sources](https://www.schroders.com/en/bm/asset-management/insights/economic-views/what-happens-if-uk-interest-rates-turn-negative/) and my own observations, some banks, especially EU ones, are having negative interest rates. This means that savers have to pay to hold their money and borrowers 'are paid' to borrow money.

This may be viewed as a quantitative easing technique to alleviate the COVID-19 crisis ([source](https://www.schroders.com/en/bm/asset-management/insights/economic-views/what-happens-if-uk-interest-rates-turn-negative/)), however such a trend can be observed before the COVID-19 outbreak ([source](https://www.theguardian.com/money/2019/aug/13/danish-bank-launches-worlds-first-negative-interest-rate-mortgage) was published 2019 Aug), meaning that negative interest rates may be here to stay for long.

How, in your opinion, does negative interest rates affect areas of investing? In what ways can investors and other capital owners take advantage of this?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Question about tax on intra-year gains and losses So let's say there's a scenario like this:

\+At the start of **2020** I decided to buy a $500 options on Tesla.

\+Tesla stock performed really well and by the end of **2020** say I had like a $1mil profit.

\+I got spooked by the bubble and realized my $1mil profit before **2020** ends.

\+**2021** comes around and I use my 1 mil money to invest in the next big company.

\+Turns out it's Nikola and my $1mil evaporates into like $100 overnight.

So the way I understand how tax works is that I still have to pay around $420k of tax in **2021** for my gain in **2020**. Even if I sell my Nikola stock then the loss wouldn't be counted in until **2022**. Is this correct? If so, it sounds like I'm screwed if I just have average income that in no way allow me to afford $420k. Is there anything I can do if I get caught in this kind of situation?

Of course, I know the sensible thing to do is prolly set aside $420k before continuing to invest. But I'm just presenting a scenario to know how to account tax into my investing strategy. Thank you.

&#x200B;

EDIT: Thank you all for answering my question. I'm not actually $420k deep in debt or anything but I feel like this might be a possible trap that new investors (me being one) might get caught in. I was one of the idiots guilty of having thought 'The worst I can lose is my initial capital' before tax matters came into my mind. Still, is there anything you can do if you're ever caught in such a situation? Like requesting to postpone your tax return filing until **2022** so you can count the loss in or something? Or do you just have to sell off your kidney at this point?

&#x200B;

EDIT2:  [danp60](https://www.reddit.com/user/danp60/) raised a really good point. The US tax system is actually a pay-as-you-go system (you pay on the same year you receive your income). I never thought of it like that, but it actually makes sense when I think about the tax withholding on my paychecks. The reason people usually don't get underpayment penalty is because they owe less than $1000 or 10% of their total liability when they do tax return. So if I profited $1mil in **2020** then I should've paid the tax for that profit before **2020** ended, not wait until after I've filed my tax return on **2021**. The video in this link explains it pretty well

Learning some pretty important hidden (for me) corners in investing through this thread._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ SIPC is useless? > During a bankruptcy segerated funds are often pooled before being paid out. If something goes missing or the broker acts fraudulently your cash and stocks will only be insured up to a certain limited - depending on your region and jurisdiction this varies. Most US brokers are members of SIPC (insured up to 500k - 250k in cash). Let me tell you though just because SIPC insurance is 500k there is no guarantee you will get paid in full. SIPC may choose not to pay out in cases of fraud and if you look at the SIPC fund its around 2.5-4 billion. Take interactive brokers for example they hold over 120 billion in client assets. In such a case even SIPC is in no way sufficient should in theory all those assets be gone._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Socially responsible brokerage? I currently do my investing through Charles Schwab.

Any suggestions on which brokerages are more socially responsible?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Vanguard ETFs auto investing? Hi,

I am looking to set up automatic investments every month to my portfolio in my brokerage account. My simple two fund portfolio currently consists of the following ETFs:

-BND
- VTI

I noticed that Vanguard only allows automatic investing for mutual funds. I read that it’s recommended to contribute every month to take advantage of dollar cost averaging, vs. investing a larger lump sum once or twice a year. 

So would you switch to mutual funds to enable automatic investments or keep portfolio as is? Is there another automated way for monthly investing for ETFs? I am aware that mutual fund require higher minimums and expense ratios. If I do switch.. do I have to sell my ETFs or can I convert them to a mutual fund? 

Thanks!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ NIO, XPENG and Li Auto: will any of these become the next Tesla? I see a lot of people being bullish on chinese EV companies. Almost the majority of opinions I read/hear will say "buy buy buy". I saw some red flags recently and I have decided to make my own research. I wanted to make a fact-based, data-backed analysis and try to predict where this thing is actually going.

I found out some interesting things - TLDR: I don't agree with the strong bullish sentiment around these stocks right now.

After quite some gains, it can be difficult to part with these stocks, but taking profits looks like the safe thing to do when it comes to these companies. In fact, all three are highly valued: XPeng trades for 2021 projected revenues of more than 15 times. NIO for 11 times 2021 revenue and Li for about 10 times 2021 sales. Additionally, for at least a couple more years, neither will have significant profits [according to analysts](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/nio/analysis?ltr=1).

Several business, government, and market threats are also tough challenges for Chinese EV firms. Chinese state subsidies are dropping and may expire, while in China, competition for EVs is getting fierce. In addition, a recent bill passed by Congress aims to delist Chinese firms whose accounting methods are not up to U.S. requirements.

Then, the recently arrived Covid vaccinations could make the process of taking the market's attention away from high growth stocks and directing it to businesses which were the most damaged by the spread of the virus only faster.

What do you guys think about this? Are you feeling bullish or do you also share my sentiment?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Dizzying Valuations, IPO Craze Tick Boxes on Bubble Checklist [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-02/dizzying-valuations-ipo-craze-tick-boxes-on-bubble-checklist](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-02/dizzying-valuations-ipo-craze-tick-boxes-on-bubble-checklist)

The IPO market is manic. Stocks haven’t been this expensive since the dot-com era. The Nasdaq 100 has doubled in two years, leaving its valuation bloated -- all while volatility remains stubbornly high.

It’s a setup that’s left investors sitting on fat returns from 2020, a year that defied easy explanation. It’s also one that has a growing cohort of experts warning about a bubble.

Knowing when market rallies turn from logical to excessive is always tough. It was nearly impossible as 2020 ended, with interest rates pinned near zero and the federal government unleashing another $900 billion into the economy. But history offers clues, and a raft of current market conditions meet criteria that would likely be found on a bubble checklist.

Take a study by Harvard University researchers published in 2019. It noted that while not every stock surge meets with disaster, those that do share some attributes, including increased share issuance, heightened volatility, and a sector or index that doubles and is twice as high as the broader market. Check, check and almost check.

“Are there areas of the market that are in a bubble? Yeah, clearly,” Peter Cecchini, founder of AlphaOmega Advisors LLC, said on Bloomberg’s “What Goes Up” podcast, adding that “many of those are obviously speculative technology companies.”

Share issuance, initial public offerings and blank-check companies have grown so popular that record after record fell in 2020. U.S. companies sold $368 billion in new stock last year, 54% more than the prior high, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

IPOs raised $180 billion, the most ever, as companies including Snowflake Inc., Airbnb Inc., and DoorDash Inc. took advantage of the rebound in equity markets. First-day pops in share price among the newcomers were the biggest in two decades, according to Bill Smith, CEO and co-founder of Renaissance Capital LLC.

“Those are telltale signs,” said Robin Greenwood, professor at Harvard Business School and co-author of the 2019 study. “The probability of a market correction is much greater today than in the historical average.”

A subclass of IPOs took off in 2020 as well, adding to worries. Special-purpose acquisition vehicles, which use proceeds from a stock sale to acquire a private company, raised about $80 billion in 2020, more than was notched in aggregate over the previous decade. SPACs that made a purchase are up about 100% for the year, according to research from George Pearkes, global macro strategist at Bespoke Investment Group.

“That’s pretty bubbly stuff,” he wrote in a recent note, though he added that what’s “more remarkable” is that SPACs that have yet to announce deals have gained about 20%. “Obviously, this is pretty speculative behavior.”

While certain assets exhibit worrying signs, the broader market may not be in for an immediate comeuppance. For one, the Federal Reserve has promised to keep interest rates pinned near zero, making stretched stock valuations look more reasonable when compared to bond yields.

And the Harvard researchers say the Nasdaq 100, while on a historic run that’s seen its price double in just two years, is still not exorbitantly elevated relative to the S&P 500 Index, compared to previous bubbles. The broader gauge has rallied 50% since 2018 and is not trailing the tech-heavy gauge by enough to meet their criteria.

Bubble talk has simmered for months, prompting plenty of warnings from the likes of Greenlight Capital’s David Einhorn to Wolfe Research strategists.

As the S&P 500 closed out 2020 with a solid but still-modest gain of 16%, spots on the market’s kookier fringes have recently seen trouble. Since peaking in December, vaccine heroes Moderna Inc. and BioNTech have both plunged 35% without any obvious catalyst for the selling. FuboTV Inc., up 596% as of Dec. 22, has lost almost half its value as share lock-ups expired. Shares of insurance company Lemonade Inc. have swung violently as similar restrictions were lifted.

“People have gotten back to a narrative-over-valuation discipline. You can slap the ‘disruptor’ name on something and have it go up 10 times for no real reason,” said Jon Burckett-St. Laurent, senior portfolio manager at Exencial Wealth Advisors. “So yeah, there are pockets of the market that don’t make a ton of sense to me.”

Bubble warnings are liable to get louder in 2021, when companies will have to deliver profits that justify valuations that by historical measures have grown stretched. The S&P 500 ended the year trading at almost 30 times profits, meaning it will start a new year higher than at any time since 2000. The Nasdaq 100 is at 40 times earnings, a level not seen in two decades.

Other price trends have raised eyebrows. Bitcoin’s record-breaking advance. Heightened trading by retail investors that’s inflated previously little-known companies. Tesla Inc.’s 750% bulge. Through it all, the Cboe Volatility Index never closed below 20 after spiking to 80 in March. At 23, it remains above its long-term average of 19.5.

“As speculative juices flow, people become more entrenched with opportunities to make a quick buck. That could be dangerous,” said Marshall Front, the chief investment officer at Front Barnett Associates. “You never know how long the party goes, but it doesn’t end well._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_
