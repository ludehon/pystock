Do we just assume that it is going to stay on this track? I'm thinking of putting $10k into ICLN. I currently have 100 shares and have had a 45% return so far.

Hello everyone, 

Happy new Year!

I would have one question. There is something strange what I can not understand. 

Unfortunately I can not post a photo here, so I'll try to explain. 

I would be really thankful, if I could get some explanation. 

The question is about CureVac (NASDAQ: CVAC) and its stock price in August and September (IPO: 14 August 2020). If I type "Curevac stock price" in google and look at their char (directly in Google) there is an extreme volatility from August until October. Price was about 6 USD then 40 USD then again low around 1-2 USD at beginning of September then again high to 40 USD then again low, there is about 5-6 jumps and drops until the price "fix" to around 40 USD in October and then have "normal" (usual) chart development. (Screenshot would help, but I can not post an image in this sub). If I look on some another websites (ex. Yahoo Finance), I do not find this volatile period, price chart looks way more normal. 

Is there any explanation why Google Chart for CVAC Stock price looks so for August and September? Was the price really so volatile?

Thank You in andvance. I wish you a nice day and succesful start in the new year.

Best regards,

BigFam23_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Total market margin debt compared to S&P 500 I often see questions about opening positions based on margin in this and similar subreddits. I am personally not a fan of buying stocks with loaned money and I would like to bring the following figure about margin debt and market cap of S&P 500 positions to your attention:

https://imgur.com/a/FI7eibQ

Off course the trends in margin might be partially explainable through the total underlying value of the market, albeit flawed as margin does not directly move with stock prices. But I find it a solid point to think twice about the current state of the market and whether to open margins in euphoric trends. 

This is not to say there is never a place for margins (although limited in my opinion), nor that a market crash is incoming (I personally think the low interest rate will conti je to be a strong provider for a 2021 bull market), but I was curious to open the discussion about margin calls. As Warren Buffet says: "Be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful"._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Does anybody know how to get info on "corporate actions?" I have a ton of large corporate action fees in my weBuLL account I have a lot of large corporate action fees in my weBuLL account. When I Google or search Reddit nothing comes up anywhere. I asked weBuLL and they said I shouldn't have to pay them but they have already been deducted from my trading account. The most recent corporate action is a "PDYPY" corporate action on 12/04/2020. I looked up PDYPY and they are a gambling company. The only stock I trade in the gambling sector is $DKNG and I'm short 4 shares. Is this why I was charged a corporate action from PDYPY? How can I find this answer? I have looked on the internet and I cannot find the answer. Is their a corporate action help page anywhere?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Looking for thoughts on ticker:GMBL Im getting into some ESPORT stocks as i think and truly believe this will rocket as time passes.

As we start a new year I'm curious what the community is looking at from a contrarian investment standpoint.  My philosophy is the best way to make money is to find the contrarian ideas that will become the consensus. 

I think we've seen that with EV, tech, biotech this year. What else are we missing or is it just more companies within this categories that we're missing right now?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Xlf? I don't see many people including this in short term or long term portfolios. Seems like a sector that can't go down much more and has room to recover and also run. May not be sexy.

Any thoughts?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ RE investing Capital gains Hi guys. Is it better to re-invest capital gains on a stock? Does the amount of shares you own increase or will it stay the same? If that's the case it would probably be better to not re-invest capital gains in the same stock, am I correct? Thanks_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ NNDM & 2021 So, NNDM has been showing a lot of potential in 2020. They had a halt in 2020 sales because of the pandemic, but they still got ARK Invest interest and investment. The x6 growth they had this year got a lot of YouTubers interest, and sort of helped it grows as well, were the reason for me to hesitant investing in the company... until I saw this interview with the CEO (Look on YouTube, I can't post any links)

So now, in thinking, wow... this Is a good opportunity.

US has been talking about IP stolen by Chinese companies. So more investment in internal R&D trend will start.
(once covid pass, this type of R&D is done in person)

3D has been on the rise for years and keep going. I'm thinking of custom gamers computer on demand shops.

The space industry is exploding, and NNDM printers can work in space!

They have requiring revenue from selling materials and services. This is going to keep growing YoY.

They have government and private customers.

They have over $400M in cash with no debt & just over 50 employees. 

They don't have competition that as big
as then, and the CEO said they about to
buy them.

And my biggest one of all is the YouTube hype on top of all of that, it's like TSLA... so every time they will buy a competitor. ARK will buy. YouTube will report, the market will follow.
So I decided to go all-in (well, 20% of my portfolio) and buy their stock on Monday.

I will have a 30% stop loss to tolerate any major market swings, this is an election year... but also as the max, I'm willing to lose "Realistically. I believe they will go to $40 by the end of the year. So about 300% growth.

The only downside I have right now is that this will go back to $3 once the hype is over (mainly if they won't buy a competitor in Q1)

So Tm here to ask for your opinion. Why shouldn't I buy NNDM?

I'm Interest to hear from people who don't own the stock and researched it or if you own it but hesitant to buy more..._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ What makes Palantir unique? I keep hearing about this company. What's so special about their technology/software? I noticed that some people on this sub consider them to be the next big thing. But I'm subscribed to TipRanks, and the stock has a -40% downside there. Most analysts don't like their current valuation.

And can someone tell me what [neoclassical social theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_social_theory) is? Apparently, their CEO has a Ph.D. in it.  All I can find about neoclassical theory is related to economics. He also happens to be a "progressive socialist" who hates Trump.

We’ve entered the “renewables-energy arms race” and with administrations, such as Biden’s, looking into fostering more and more renewables solutions, do you guys think the space is really THAT overvalued long-term?

Nuclear fusion aside, it seems like renewables are going towards replacing fossil fuels and while it might take some time before they do, as a long term investor, do you still see value in investing in those renewables that have shot up +100% this year?
Thanks for the thoughts!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ I just don't see the hype in BB (Blackberry) They have SO much going for them in terms of market stability, margins, and recent partnerships. And with current events (the Russian hack on the Pentagon), it seems like a no-brainer. But then I look at their chart (5yr) and it just looks so... low energy. It seems like so much potential put into the hands of snails. I literally would have made more money investing in a bond than BB stock 2 years ago.

Can anyone explain why it should be any different now? A lot of analyst are saying they're undervalued._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Hesitant to buy stock in well known companies I'm hesitant to buy stock in well known companies like Apple, Disney and Tesla.

ARKF - 25%

Or if the stock is $100 and I can only afford 3  etc. Basically is there an easy way for me to keep myself in check and  calculate on the fly quickly?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Investing in REITs for long term investments. A LOT of REITs are undervalued due to pandemic woes and have not recovered. 

According to a wise man on Wall Street (Warren Buffet) he says all stocks are to regain value in due time, due to supply and demand. Currently there’s A LOT of supply for hotels and services but there is no demand because of lockdowns. 

What to do with this knowledge? Possibly invest in REITs in long run hoping that people return to hotel and vacation home rentals in the near term future 2-3 years. The expected EPS growth from last year to this current year 2021 is to be 200% greater. However IF traveling and vacations return back to normal this EPS growth could increase by more than 500% according to some analysts.

REITs are Investments in companies that own a large sum of hotels, vacation homes, and other travel related luxuries.

The commuting stocks have been rebounding as of late as the travel stay related stocks have been lagging. REITs are quite possibly the smartest thing you can invest in for the short term and long term considering many of these companies cannot go lower due to leveraged assets and most of them are debt free.  

Love to hear feedback on these REIT investments and if YOU have made any as of late, me personally i have invested in AHT for the LONG term._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ ICLN Going up? Biden set to supercharge clean energy push with $40B stash I'm dumb. Does anyone know if this is great news for ICLN?

Also, important to note from the article: **"The $40 billion in DOE loan guarantee money is just a small fraction of the trillions of dollars needed to meet Biden’s goals of achieving net-zero emissions on the power grid by 2035 and economy-wide by 2050."**

2. SEDG (3.74%)
3. SGRE.BC (3.39%)
4. VWS (3.35%)
5. ADSK (3.11%) 

It has an average of 17-19% overlap with the other ETFS so needless to say its not a re-skin of them. I know the other ETFs had a crazy year but looking at growth other than 2020, the ETF did outperform them (especially PBW, it was practically dead till 2020). It doesn’t rely on EV companies such as NIO and TSLA so thats something.

*****
> Stocks exit 2020 with strong gains and are riding a tailwind, but already in the dawn of the new year, the market could face its first big challenge.
*****
> The final outcome of the 2020 election plays out Tuesday, when voters in Georgia will pick their senators and decide which party controls the U.S. Senate.
*****
> With President-elect Joe Biden heading to the White House and a Democratic-controlled House of Representatives, Wall Street has been comfortable with the view that Biden and the Democrats could not succeed with tax hikes and more progressive policy changes while Republicans hold the Senate.
*****
> The runoff election for the two Senate seats Tuesday is widely expected to result in one or both of the incumbent Republican senators retaining their seats. But Democrats are close in the polls and should they win, each party would have 50 seats with Vice President-elect Kamala Harris the tie breaker.
*****
> “Georgia is the most important thing to the Biden presidency for the next two years,” said Ed Mills, Washington policy analyst at Raymond James. “It’s going to determine what is the legislative agenda and who can get confirmed by the United States Senate.”
*****
> Sen. David Perdue is being challenged by Democrat Jon Ossoff, while GOP Sen. Kelly Loeffler is running against Democrat Raphael Warnock. None of the candidates had more than 50% of the vote in the Nov. 3 election, so Georgia law requires a runoff election between the two leading candidates for each seat.
*****
> “It’s a binary event,” said Mills, adding it’s of growing interest to markets. “The general sense for the market is that Republicans are well positioned to maintain their majority in the Senate. But I think the 2020 election as well as the 2016 election and to some extent, the 2018 election has humbled us … The Senate outcomes, in particular, seem to be less predictable than almost any other elections.”
*****
> Mills said the results may take several days to determine, adding to the uncertainty the event could hold for markets. According to an RBC investor survey, 88% expect Republicans to maintain control, and most say that is a positive for the stock market.
*****
> “The market tends to shoot first and ask questions later. There will certainly be a reaction if Democrats win both those seats,” said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group. Strategists say there could be a relief rally if Republican incumbents see a clear victory.
*****
> “That totally dominates [trading] because it’s about do we have status quo or do we have Democrats controlling all parts of Washington and what that means for spending and taxes,” Boockvar said. “I think you could see the worries about taxes overwhelming any thoughts on the benefits of more spending” by Democrats.
*****
> # By the numbers
> A year of extreme volatility ended with a big win for stocks, as the pandemic steered the course for markets. The S&P 500 was up 16.3% for the year, ending at 3,756. That gain comes after a 34% decline early in the year, followed by a powerful more-than 65% rebound. Technology was the big winner for the year, and the Nasdaq was up 43.6% at 12,888.
*****
> Besides the runoff vote, the market will be watching a stream of data in the coming week, including the important December jobs report Friday. That could show fewer than 100,000 jobs were added as the spreading virus impacted hiring and layoffs. There were 245,000 jobs created in November.
*****
> There is also ISM manufacturing data Tuesday, and a number of Fed speakers, including Vice Chairman Richard Clarida on Friday.
*****
> The virus itself could also be a factor for stocks.
*****
> Conventional wisdom for the coming year has been that vaccines will be widely distributed, and by the second half things will start to get back to normal and the economy will pick up. But the initial distribution has been slow, and far short of the 20 million targeted for December by President Donald Trump’s task force.
*****
> In that recent RBC survey, three quarters of investors were optimistic about vaccine distribution with 80% expecting a majority to be vaccinated by the end of 2021. “We suspect that the positive outlook for the stock market and the economy would deteriorate if expectations for a smooth vaccine rollout are not met,” RBC strategists wrote.
*****
> They also noted that nearly 60% of the investors surveyed believe high stock market valuations are problematic.
*****
> “This suggests to us that any threat to the economic and earnings recovery story could spark profit-taking. On this point, it is worth noting that the vaccine was the No. 1 issue keeping investors up at night, closely followed by monetary policy and excessive optimism on the recovery,” the strategists noted.
*****
> Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank, said investors will also be watching the formal acceptance of the Electoral College vote Wednesday. Strategists expect the vote count to confirm Biden’s presidency.
*****
> However, Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley says he will challenge the certification, and several House Republicans have already vowed to contest the election at that time. If one House member and a senator jointly object to a state’s slate of electors, the two houses of Congress must separately debate and vote on the objection.
*****
> Strategists see little chance of any impact on the election outcome, but there could be fireworks. Trump has been claiming since the election that there was fraud but multiple courts failed to find any truth to the claims.
*****
> Rupkey said investors are not taking into account enough potential for political risk from the deep animosity between the two political parties.
*****
> “I think the additional stimulus and hopes for additional stimulus, and infrastructure spending in 2021, I don’t know that that is such a slam dunk, because of the issue of political instability,” he said.

> # Why A Year-End Rally Bodes Well For 2021

> Welcome to the last day of 2020! It has been a devastating year in so many ways, yet for investors it has been quite rewarding. Much of the gains in 2020 have taken place the final two months, with the S&P 500 Index up more than 14% in November and December so far, the best end to a year since WWII.

> A big end of year rally could have bulls smiling in 2021. “Turns out a 10% or more gain the final two months of the year has equaled a higher S&P 500 the following year every single time since World War II,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “In fact, January was also higher every single time as well, so maybe this strong rally to end the year is a clue for higher prices into next year.”

> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the S&P 500 gained an average of more than 18% the year following a 10% or more surge during the final two months of the year. Meanwhile, January was up 5 for 5 as well, rising an impressive 3% on average.

> Here’s what the average year looks like after the prior year gains 10% or more the final two months compared to a typical year. Once again, strong returns are the playbook historically.

> # Fifty to Zero in 283 Days

> In a year with some pretty crazy charts, the one below is right up there with some of the best. After all the markets have been through this year, bot the S&P 500 and Long-Term Treasuries have seen nearly identical returns on a total return basis. That's right, with just a few hours left in the trading year, the S&P 500's total return in 2020 has been a gain of 17.6%, while Long Term US Treasuries, as measured by the B of A Merrill Lynch Long-Term Treasury Index has rallied 17.3%. What makes this nearly identical performance all the more incredible is that on March 23rd, the performance gap between the two was more than 50 percentage points.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123120-Stocks-Bonds.png))**

> The fact that stocks and bonds have essentially seen identical returns this year isn't typical. The chart below shows the annual performance spread between the S&P 500 and long-term US Treasuries going back to 1978. During that time, the S&P 500 has historically outperformed long-term US Treasuries by an average of 3.9 percentage points per year, but the average gap in performance between the two has been over 15 percentage points. In the 43 years since 1978, there have only been seven other years where the performance spread between the two asset classes was less than five percentage points and just two years (1985 and 1992) where the performance spread was less than a percentage point.

> # Back-to-Back Big Years for Technology

> With just two trading days (including today) left in 2020, the S&P 500 Technology sector is on pace for its second year in a row of rallying more than 40%. Going back to 1990, the only time the Technology sector experienced back-to-back returns of more than 40% was in 1998 and 1999. Back then, not only was the Technology sector up 40%+ in back-to-back years, but it was also up over 75% in both of those years. If you think markets are pretty crazy these days, they still have nothing on the last two years of the 1990s!

> In terms of cumulative returns, the Technology sector is up 210% since the last trading day of 2018, whereas in 1999 it was up 317% in a two-year span. What's also interesting to note about the last 31 years of returns for the Technology sector is how it has only experienced five down years, while the S&P 500 has been down in ten different years during that span. Furthermore, since 2009 there has only been one down year and the decline was a paltry 1.6%. Not a bad 12-year run!

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Technology-Sector-Performance.png))**

> Given that the sector has more than doubled in the last two years, there have been some big individual winners. Topping the list with a gain of just under 400% is Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). On the last day of 2018, AMD traded hands for under $20 per share. Today's it's over $90. AMD has a lead of more than 100 percentage points over the next closest stock - NVIDIA (NVDA) - which is up 288%. Interestingly, there aren't a lot of major outliers to the upside compared to the sector's 210% gain, but that's because Apple (AAPL), the sector's largest stock, has paced the sector's gains by rallying more than 240%.

> On the downside, just four stocks in the Technology sector have declined in the last two years. The worst of these has been DXC Technology (DXC) which has lost more than half of its value, while Juniper (JNPR) and HP Enterprise (HPE) are down between 10% and 20%. Lastly, FLIR Systems (FLIR) has declined less than 2%, so depending on how it acts in the next two days, it could move into positive territory just as Intel (INTC) did yesterday after Third Point bailed it out and moved the stock barely into positive territory for the last two years.

> # Growth Dragging on Small Caps

> In the past couple of weeks, we have frequently been keeping tabs on small-cap equities which have been particularly strong performers of late resulting in very overbought readings as well as extended valuations. More specifically, taking a look at growth-oriented small-caps, with only a couple days left in the year small-cap growth stocks—proxied by the Russell 2000 Growth ETF (IWO)—are on pace to have outperformed large-cap equivalents in 2020. On December 10th, IWO surpassed the S&P 500 Growth ETF (IVW) in terms of YTD performance, and even after pulling back in the past week, IWO is still in the lead.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Small-Large1.png))**

> As a result of recent moves, there has been a sharp reversal on a relative basis between the two ETFs in the past week. In the chart below, we show the ratio of the Russell 2000 Growth ETF (IWO) versus the S&P 500 Growth ETF (IVW). This ratio took off beginning in the early fall meaning small-cap growth drastically outperformed large-cap growth. But the former's weakness in the past several days has put a halt to that move.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Small-Large2.png))**

> As to just how sharp of a reversal this was, in the five days through yesterday's close, the decline in the ratio of IWO to IVW was the largest since June. Before that, April and March saw declines that were even larger. Not only was this one of the biggest drops in the relative performance of small-cap growth to large-cap growth in the past few months, but that also stands in the bottom 0.5% of all readings going back to 2000 when the ETF first began trading. Outside of this past spring, the only other periods that have also experienced this type of underperformance of small-cap growth relative to large-cap growth was at various points in 2011, 2008, and a handful of times in the early 2000s.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Small-Large3.png))**

> Small-cap underperformance has not necessarily been broad though. For value stocks, small caps (IWN) have generally outperformed large caps (IVE) for the entirety of the new bull market. While there was a bit of a turn lower in recent days, it has been nowhere close to as dramatic of a move as growth stocks.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Small-Large4.png))**

> In the charts below, we show average performance over the past week of Russell 2000 stocks broken into deciles based on their price to sales and price to book ratios. As shown, the most aggressively valued deciles have averaged the worst performance in the past week. Stocks with low P/S and P/B ratios have not been immune from the weakness, but they have held up significantly better.

# DISCUSS!

What are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?

*****

I hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading year ahead r/stocks._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Top 10 Stocks for Roth What would be your top 10 stocks in a Roth IRA if you were fresh outta college today and have a job in your field (let's say you are about 22-24 years old and can max out the contribution limit of $6,000/year). My rationale is to pick market leaders in their TAM and are disruptive to the norm of conventional business.

This would be my top 10:

1. Tesla
2. Mecardo Libre
3. Shopify
4. The Trade Desk
5. CRISPR (or ARKG)
6. Nvidia
7. Square
8. Alibaba (or Teladoc)
9. Microsoft
10. Apple

I do not see a point in dividend stocks like PG, Coke, Caterpillar, etc. when you are young and have 30+ years for these stocks to grow and go through their ups and downs. My plan is to let these positions grow and then cash out when I retire and invest in safe dividend stocks for income.

If my rationale is twisted or wrong in any way please let me know. I am open to criticism._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Which one of the big tech companies to invest in 2021? I just started investing a few months ago after being left unemployed bc of the pandemic in March. I read books, watched videos, and learned a lot before I started in September.

I noticed recently that too much of my portfolio is invested in either new companies, stocks that were hit by Covid and I thought would bounce back (which most of them did) and recently IPO'd companies. I want to lower my risk a little bit and start investing (DCAing) in big tech companies/ETFs that have been around for a while but still have a lot of room for growth in the next year or two.

Thanks to anyone reading this for a great sub and for taking the time to explain and be nice to newbies!

I have been lurking on here for quite some time now and, going into 2021, I figured I'd start a thread to ask some of my questions for 2021. Maybe I will see them answered, or read suggestions / find inspiration.

I started investing about three months ago and am currently invested in Vanguard All World, SAP (buying after the dip has worked out well), ICLN, Nvidia, AMD. I intend to hold all of them long-term with a hopeful profit of over 5%. Nvidia has a bit more room to grow, I hope, given their sales numbers, different tech and ARM acqusition, and I am also hoping for incredible sales numbers of AMD. 

 I also hold GME because I am an absolute sheep idiot who bought into the hype high; I will probably sell low but am waiting for Jan 11. In the next few days, I want to buy a bit of Microsoft for 2021. Overall, I am looking for a relatively "safe" return of at least 5 - 10%, ideally a bit more of course. All my stock choices, however, are very tech-oriented. That is because it's the field in which I know most about the companies and their numbers, and also because they've been running well.

However, I am very new and none of this of course means that these companies will run well in 2021. If we start seeing a return to normalcy in mid 2021, what are stocks that really benefit from that return to "normalcy"? I figured Salesforce could be an option because of its dip and them also probably benefiting from overall economic upturn, just like SAP. But that, again, would be tech. I read JPM and on this subreddit a lot, what would be the reasoning here? People are also mentioning Disney: is that because of Disney+ or because of reopening theme parks? 

So, as you can see, I am open for suggestions. It'd be cool if you could help me out a bit! Thank you in advance. 

Unfortunately, I cannot invest in ARK ETFs, as none of my three European brokers offer these funds, and I am not willing to open a fourth broker account._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Using Cheap Margin for Dividend Stocks I recently found out that Interactive Brokers has a margin rate of 1.59%  

At this low of a rate, how is it not worth it to buy a decent dividend stock that pays \~3.5% or more in interest?  So for example, you're getting a 3.5% dividend, pay roughly 25% of that to the gov't, and pay 1.59% to the brokerage.

3.5% - 0.875% - 1.59% = 1.035% profit

And this doesn't even factor in potential share appreciation.  Take Coca Cola, for example.  In the past \~60 years I didn't see any dividend cuts.  They currently pay 3% and had you bought in at the pandemic low, you would've locked in a 5.3% dividend.  Or you could've sold for a 50% gain.  

If you were to have bought in back in 1962, the dividend & split-adjusted rate would be 20 cents per share, and the stock is now trading at $54

Going back to 1984, Verizon was $7.34 per share, and is now $58.

So how is it not worth it to borrow at 1.59% and just sit on a quality dividend stock?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ ETF vs Individual stock

Do you just roll the dice and hope you pick the winning stock of the sector or do you play it safe and buy them all?

I’m curious what people’s thoughts are on penny stocks that graduate to ‘regular’ stocks? For example, if you have shares of a penny stock that ‘graduates’ to a regular stock (above $5), will you hold onto the shares or sell them as soon as possible? The reason I ask is because I had shares of a penny stock that increased by 9X, I felt this was too good to be true so I sold them but in a short amount of time the stock has doubled since I sold it.

"Nikola" Nikola, 2020's shinning star that suddenly plummeted back to earth. 2020 has been a rough year for the company the accusations by researcher's, gm's & republic's deal, discontinue of badger, chairmen Trevor step down due to falsely presenting the company to the public, etc. This past year has been a huge blow to the company, but 2021 is here and this is why I bet big on this dip. First reason was to drop my previous average per shares at 39.78/s brining me down to 17.23/s a more comfortable per share rate vs. current pre market 15.04. Another reason Nikola is still underway with the building of there plant is Arizona, the republic deal falling out gave them more room to work on different aspects of the company. Also Nikola's New Hires should bring some new insight and direction the company needs moving forward this year as the hydrogen race continues. Nikolas employees were willing to extend there shares from the lock up period to a further date. That shows me they believed the stock was worth more then the current stock price at that time 2x.xx that's after declining 23% before declining to 17.15 that day another 15% down due to seller panic from news on badger selloff. What I'm trying to say is  the employees that extended there lockup believe in there product and what there accomplishing within this race of zero emissions, other wise they would of sold, shit I would of if my product was a gimmick. That gives me insurance and the employees having xx amount of stock within the company only makes them want to progress more because the more the stock goes up the more they make, the more we make. I believe Nikola is a buy at its current dip as its high last June was a price of 92.00. I Believe once Nikola gets the ball rolling with the new plant the stock will rebound quite quickly giving its volatility,  with a average price around 30.00 with slighter high/low spikes until production occurs._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ So what were your biggest winners and biggest losers of 2020?

I can see ant selling off assets and still having a Fintech presence with their holding company functioning as a bank .

JD is backed by both Google and Walmart, connected with cloud flare and I can’t see it failing, it seems like the best mid to long term growth potential and tencent will slowly grow and is discounted because of BABA as well imo .

Any advice from the people who are much more knowledgeable on here than me is greatly appreciated._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ So You Want To Be A Trader in 2021? Beware! Hello all!

Let me preface this by saying I wrote this on the options sub first because that's what I enjoy trading, but a lot of what I talk about applied to stocks/shares as well.

&#x200B;

First off, Happy New Year! It's now 2021! This means there are a lot of people that are wanting to start fresh with new goals, resolutions and getting into new hobbies or interests. If you want to start 2021 with the goal of being financially responsible, want to see if trading in the stock market is your thing, or if you've been doing it and you're just trying to find your way around this crazy mess, then read on!

&#x200B;

**1. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON A MENTOR**

\- Be cautious of who you're learning from or where you're putting your trust and money. There are many people that charge outrageous amounts of money to teach you things that you can learn on your own for free. They glamorize this rich lifestyle that they supposedly built from trading or promise you an accelerated path to profit, and now they want to help you do the same. Think about it, if these people were so successful, then why do they need to shove their courses down your throat? I, and a lot of other people, are almost entirely self-taught through reading books, websites and watching YouTube videos. I believe myself to be a self-sufficient trader now. At least for my personal goals, trading style, and expectations. You can learn on your own too, for free 99.

&#x200B;

**2. "I NEVER LOSE. I EITHER WIN, OR I LEARN"**

\- This journey you're about to start...It's hard. It really is. You're going to encounter many obstacles and experience many pitfalls. You're also going to learn many hard lessons along the way regarding patience, mistakes, risk, and discipline to name a few. You're going to lose money. You're going to feel defeated. You're going to feel like giving up. It's natural. It's human-nature. We've all gone through it. Wanting to give up and quit is especially the case when you lose your hard-earned money. Don't lose hope or give up. Ask anyone how much they lost or how long it took them before they started making money consistently. If they say $0 or not even a few months, they're lying out of their ass. If you win, great! If you lose, learn why you lost. Dig deeper into the reasons and circumstances that led to it. Arguably, you should be tracking your wins and logging that info as well so you can replicate it. I blew up my account twice (about $3500 total) and recovered it all twice (shit gets old quick btw). First from fomo'ing call options on NIO's very first run up when I didn't know about implied volatility (IV) and yolo'ing calls on Rocket's very first earnings because I didn't know that even if expectations are beat, the price direction is still 50/50. Did I feel like quitting? Of course! However, each time I lost big like that I dug into the why's and how's. Coincidentally, if you look at my post history, my very first post (and the most upvoted one) was teaching people how to play NIO's earnings the smarter/safer way. LOL.

&#x200B;

**3. TRADE WITH FAKE MONEY FIRST (OR DON'T)**

\- There's this thing called paper trading where you can try investing/trading without using your hard-earned money. Take advantage of it! I personally didn't and I somewhat regret it. I say somewhat because I believe I would've lost a lot less money than I did while learning. However, the stakes are much higher and I believe it forced me to learn faster. Losing your real money is a whole lot different than losing "fake" money and affects you much differently.  Use that information how you want to.

&#x200B;

**4. PLAN YOUR TRADE, TRADE YOUR PLAN**

\- This goes a long way. Whenever you're looking at a play. Have a plan to enter, have a plan for the duration you're in the trade, and have a plan to get out of it. Having a plan keeps you consistent. Consistency is the name of the game here. Can you ultimately make money more than you lose it? Having a plan also keeps you out of trouble. For example, one of the biggest pitfalls of trading is trading emotionally. It's almost like when poker players or video gamers "tilt". They get nervous, mad, frustrated, scared, pressured, etc and it interferes with their decision-making and thought process. Having a simple plan and following basic rules like not using money you need for bills, or putting all of your money in one trade drastically reduces the risk of getting emotional.

&#x200B;

**5. SET GOALS. REALISTIC ONES**

\- Just like having a plan, setting goals goes a long way. This also helps with staying consistent and building confidence. I have a few friends whose goal is 5-10% of profit each day. Once they make that goal, they're done for the day. Doesn't matter if they cut out too early and it keeps running. They've reached their goal and are fine with that. They do it all over again the next day.

&#x200B;

**6. FIND YOUR IDEAL TRADING STYLE**

\- Day/Scalp traders, swing traders, momentum traders, breakout traders, the list goes on. Each type of trader has their own little nuances and things to pay attention to. For example, a swing trader doesn't really care about intraday price movements as opposed to how much a day trader cares. Or a technical trader doesn't really care about the fundamentals of the company they're trading as opposed to a fundamental trader. Find what style suits your personality and/or what style fits your level of commitment. For example, day trading requires monitoring the market or price action which isn't suitable for someone who works a 9-5 job with meetings all day.

&#x200B;

**7. WELCOME TO THE RABBITHOLE!**

\- Trading requires a certain level of dedication, discipline, and effort to get good at. Do people over in the wallstreetbets sub win money with minimal effort? Yes, they do. But not all the time and is mostly based on luck, thus that "strategy" isn't sustainable. Learn as much as you can from as many (reputable) sources as possible. Try out what they're teaching, tweak it, fine tune it to how you trade. Even though you've been trading forever and might think you know something, someone else comes along that can do what you do a million times better, faster, and more efficiently. My main point is never stop learning. #StayLearningStayEarning is the motto of my YT channel because although I learned enough to be a self-sufficient trader, I'm still open-minded and make an effort to learn as much as I can. I don't know everything, I'm not perfect, but I definitely want to be better than I was yesterday.

&#x200B;

**8. WHAT GOES UP (ESPECIALLY IN A VERY SHORT TIME), MUST COME DOWN**

\- Don't get caught in the hype of a certain ticker, especially penny stocks. When people ask me what I think about x company and I look at the chart and see green candles for days going vertical or almost vertical, I tell them it's not worth my time and I personally don't want to trade it. Can you still trade things that run up crazy like that? Of course you can! I've stayed in trades that got me over 100% in profit, but stayed in it because it showed me it wasn't done running yet. However, that's a discussion for another day. But since you're a beginner, I'd strongly advise against it until you, at the very least, start to feel comfortable.

&#x200B;

That's all I can think of at the moment, but I'm sure that's enough to give you a good foundation. If you have any questions or need help with something, feel free to message or comment. If you did check my post history for that NIO post I referenced back in #2, you'll find that I'm very open to helping. I love helping people with what I know. If you have anything to add to the list that I forgot, by all means, comment them down below to help our new brothers and sisters.

Wishing you all a very healthy, happy, and profitable 2021!

Edit: Please read the post fully and carefully before starting a riot in the comments. Some people in r/options are arguing points I agree with and talk about in the post or are missing key details. Also, the 5-10% goal per day thing is the goal for the day, on one trade.

Last quarter FDX had an amazing quarter so I’m wondering why it’s dipping? Is it a good time to buy in or do you think it was overvalued and now normalising?

Any insight or even leads for info are appreciated_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ This is my investment strategy, what do you think? Just wanna show you my current plan and see what you think about it. I currently have, in theory, set it up like this, at least this is the goal:

**Emergency money:**

\- 2-3 monthly salaries on my savings account at my bank.

\- 2-3 monthly salaries that I have invested in a 30 % stocks / 70 % bonds ETF portfolio, which is pretty "safe" because of the 70 % bonds portion.

**Long term investments:**

\- 2 monthly salaries I have invested in fix interest crowd investment projects and I have the intention to keep it that way, because I don't like the "issuer risk". But still, I do enjoy supporting some projects I do believe can change the world :-P

\- Every month I do invest 25 % of my salary into a riskier 70 % stocks / 30 % bonds ETF portfolio, which is meant to grow for the next 10-15 years. I am not sure yet, if I do actually need the 30 % bonds here.

**Burning:**

\- Whenever I have some spare money, I will "burn" it in stocks I believe in and also some long term call options.

What do you think? Is this reasonable / healthy?

Or would you exchange the 30 % bonds part with a full 100 % stock ETF portfolio?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Why GoPro (GPRO) stock is so cheap? A company which almost every camera enthusiast knows. Seems to have positive cashflow as well. Only 900 people workforce means less operational cost. Great products with manufacturing outsourced to China like all the physical product companies. Market disruptive in action camera segment.

The price of 8$ a stock just simply doesn't make sense to me.

I am looking for a healthy discussion surrounding this company and whether it's a good option to make a six figure (buy-it-and-forget-it-for-a-year) investment.

Is the price absolutely bottomed out? I mean it's definitely not a a penny-stock company, so can't imagine going it till 3-4$. However, that's just my instinct feeling. Also, what do you think of its upside potential?

If I throw 6 figure on this, my expectation would at least be 25% return (10$ stock price) and a stop loss of 10% (7$ stock price).

One is Greenlane Renewables (GRN) and the other is Loop Insights (MTRX). They both operate in different industries with long term tailwinds ahead for them.i have been monitoring them for quite some time and did enough DD to convince me they are great long term holds.

Greenlane is a renewable natural gas industry which decarbonizes and converts biogas Into renewable natural gas. Their recent earnings report shows a profit for the first time. I consider them a leader in this industry because they're the only RNG company that uses all 3 gas separation techniques: power washing, membrane separation, and adsorption. The natural gas industry is set to take off this decade and is shown to be more efficient than clean renewable energy while still better for the environment than traditional gas. I bought 782 shares of GRN.

Loop insights is a data company that has gives retail insights  to its clients and monitors consumer spending to personalize offers for customers. They have a 100% successful venue bubble for COVID contact tracing and they have 2 products released on the Telus IoT marketplace (renewed their telus partnership again). They recently announced a partnership with NTT data which is the 4th largest IoT provider in the world. They're revolutionary product Uklipz is a video review tool that gives real time info and reviews on a retail store from verified users. Amazon and other big companies have come to Loop insights for this product due to the amount of fake reviews plaguing their sites. Loop also recently released a digital health platform where provincial health systems can connect with eachother on big issues surrounding the healthcare industry. Individuals can also access their medical records online and book appointments with their family doctors. I bought 440 shares of MTRX.

I gave short summaries for both companies I invested in and feel they have great long term potential for this year and beyond. One is in the RNG space while the other is in Data and AI/IoT.

Do you feel they have more partnerships and deals to announce coming soon?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Hey guys thinking about getting into stocks, can you help me.

Thanks!!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ What line show amount that’s being charged interest in Fidelity? I apparently accidentally used margin trading stocks and it shows I owe a few dollars interest. I read over margin on Fidelity’s website and I can not make heads or tails of it. 

(Numbers below are rounded and off by a couple dollars here and there)

Under Balances in my Roth at Fidelity: My cash core says $16,000. Below that line, I see a negative cash debit of $289 that I am guessing is somehow from an option I hold. Is that causing interest to be charged? Cash available to trade and withdraw says $183. Why wouldn’t the cash go to cover the $289 and prevent interest being charged? I asked a Fidelity rep who said read about it and was condescending and unhelpful. I don’t think he understood it either, but he didn’t want to admit that.

In my individual account under Balances: margin equity percentage 97.8 percent, cash buying power $3097, settled cash $3192, cash core $3100, margin debit - $359 , margin accrued $15.39

I don’t understand what is causing the interest charge exactly. 
It defaults to margin when I make trades which is frustrating and I forget to switch it to cash half the time. 
I am calling Mon to get the margin taken off but don’t want to ask them these questions after the rudeness of the other rep,
