 Ok, everybody needs to take a few deep breaths and cool it. We need to set one thing straight. Do we have the power to move the stock market or not? Just 2 weeks ago the overwhelming sentiment was "this is the hedge funds game, we're just trying to catch a ride. Individual retail investors can't do shit to move markets. We're hyennas picking at Zebra carcasses, but sooner or later the Lions are going to come back and reclaim their feast." 

Now it's a complete 180. I'm seeing tons of outrage from people who got burnt today on their weed calls. Acting like this lot of new degenerates came in and pumped the price before bailing, thus crushing the overall market. 20% gains for them cost you tens of thousands on your call options. Well, how much blame does the media get? 8 million people in this sub is a lot, but how many people does CNBC, Fox Business, The Wall Street Journal, Market Watch, The New York Times, etc. Reach? When they all band together and spend 2-3 full trading days only talking about "the new Wall Street Bets move", how many day traders come running? Just Google "Wall Street Bets weed" to see what I'm talking about.

We're either being played, or it's actually us having this big of an impact on the market. I don't know the answer. So let's look at both scenarios. 

**We control the market**

This is dope! We can work with this, and grow into it, but first I want to get something off my chest. FUCK YOU! Talkin bout "degenerates ruining my weed plays". Bitch, what have you been chortling about with GME this whole time? "üíéüñêü¶ç Gang got greedy and forgot to hedge profits." 
"I took my gains at 300 like a pro." 
"It's so funny how the smooth brains got left holding the bag." 
Preaching about holding the line in January while you turned 100 @ $5 into 15 @ $50, then switched to pissing on "bag holders" for "getting played" in February. 

If we truly have the power to move markets, then the $10's of millions in profits everyone took is what brought down the rising market caps. It also bailed out the shorts who were/are less than halfway done covering (TLRY has high SI too). Then we went and did the exact same thing with weed stocks. Don't hate the player, hate the game right? Ultimately, something tells me stocks don't move up when everyone is trying to play with house money. Definitely can't "hold any lines" with house money either. We should invest in stocks we care about for their long term potential; any squeezes or pumps that potentially come out of that are just an added benefit.

**We don't have the power to move markets** 

That's cool. We're still getting blamed for it, though. Not just from salty weed "bag holders" in here, but from all of the media. We got blamed for this meteoric rise, and within 20 minutes of the tank in pre-market CNBC was already pointing the finger at us. Weed Stocks have been on the rise for 3 months, if you guys were just riding a wave none of us "retail traders" have any control over, then what crashed it? I won't speculate on that because it falls under "conspiracy bullshit" but we should discuss it. I posted [this thread this morning](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lhm0wz/were_weed_stocks_and_silver_pumped_by_hfs_to/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) claiming it was a diversion attempt away from GME, and urged people to "cash out their gains before it crashes." I wrote it before the price tanked. The mods deleted it, and rightfully so. I don't have any evidence to back up that theory. What I'm trying to say now isn't about GME either. 

However, if we don't actually have any control over the stock market we should be using the media manipulation to make fat gains before we get fucked by big time day traders and algorithm options trading. As soon as they dump a trend on us, we should dump that trend. If the price follows immediately, we'll know we actually have control of these markets, if it doesn't we'll know we're getting played and figure out why. What do you guys think? Quit "REEEEE"-ing all over the place and let's figure this shit out!!

P.S. RIP to all the people who bought both TLRY and GME at their peaks and still have no idea what happened.

Edit:
I'm not a financial advisor. Everything above is pure speculation. I'm just a dude bored during a Pandemic who apparently likes losing money. (also changed some wording in OP)_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ New People: Understand the difference between MEME content and actual trading habits Because my last post got deleted, here's a more "friendly" version.

The memes on here use to be hilarious, uncensored, offensive and some of the worst advice you could possibly imagine. The thing is people understood the humor. Most understood market fundamentals and traded options. If you trade options you're a big brain mf, congrats and fuck you.

But new people reposting these shitpost memes everywhere, on every social media channel, comment thread, where ever, you're kinda fucking it up imo.

There was a massive difference between sharing personal investment/yolo stories to a group of 10-900K people and trying to hype up specific stocks to 8.9 MILLION or more random folks.

Ever since GME, WSB has become famous. So famous that [an ETF is being developed that will track trending stocks on social media like WSB.](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/vaneck-social-sentiment-etf-target-social-media-reddit-meme-stocks-2021-2-1030056054) People with money are going to take advantage of this easily influenced massive group of retail traders for their own gain if they haven't already.

&#x200B;

So what is the message here?

You should know the difference between investing and gambling, between GME and any other stock. Memes for GME do NOT apply to EVERY OTHER STOCK when it falls or when you're holding. The memes were fun but they really ONLY APPLIED to the GME situation.

If you want to invest please please please spend some time getting a basic understanding of volatility, risk management, trend patterns. Read the analysis behind companies before you invest. This is probably the ONLY time where "Do your own research" ACTUALLY BENEFITS YOU.

And always remembers that if you're gambling to rapidly make gains, you can just as suddenly lose your money.

Enjoy the memes, just don't bet on them.

Housing absolutely went in the toilet, and housing bonds were a god damn black hole sucking Fannie and Freddie closer and closer to insolvency. Well, in walks the US government which created the FHFA. These guys were, and are, the oversight to Fannie and Freddie. The deal that was struck dolled out about 190B to shore up their balance sheets and the government got senior preferred shares at 10%, plus warrants for 80% of the companies. Other parts of the agreement forced payments equaling the entire market cap of each *quarterly*. This was completely untenable, and they had to borrow more money just to pay it, so that was nixed. Instead, amendment 3 was put into effect. This capped the capital each could hold at 3B and *all* profits go to the US treasury. Ever since the crash Fannie and Freddie have been held in this limbo called conservatorship. The amount of profit robbed from shareholders by the government to date is $124B. 

This would create a lot of outrage, right? Well there‚Äôs a case pending at the Supreme Court, advocating for their $124 billion. The crazy part is how the case is being argued. They aren‚Äôt just saying the agreement was unlawful. They are saying *the structure of their FHFA regulator* is unconstitutional. That structure isn‚Äôt unique. If they win, decades of government policy will overnight be thrown out. No one knows what would happen. The only thing we know for sure is that Fannie and Freddie would 50x over night.

DFV had it right on the fundamentals in market context and still has it right. **Listen up Retards, I have no idea idea what I'm talking about, but you should stop panic selling and get back in GME, HODL, and DO NOT LOOK at your balance for the next six months.** 

I'm late to GME and bought into the hype. Every day I've been tracking GME and got really close to selling, but before I sold, I decided study u/deepfuckingvalue activity for insights into why GME. I found a comment about that locked me in and want to discuss with you retards.

The news screams at us that the market is over valued. Time and time again a company has $40bn market cap on a measly $2bn revenue with $500mm profits. Who in their right minds would say a company is worth $40bn when it would take 80 years to see ROI. OVER VALUED TRASH. Even UBER report billions in losses but institutional investors are still riding a wave on overvalued trash, why shouldn't we do the same? 

GME is a good buy compared to loads of other OVER VALUED trash on the market. 

>People talk up the demise of GameStop yet here they are about to generate over $2b in revs in a single quarter at the tail end of a console cycle. - u/deepfuckingvalue 

$2bn in revenue in a quarter is not bad. In 2020, GME had revenues of $6.5bn with $300mm in losses down from $8.3 revenue with $491mm in losses in 2019--their worst year since each year before they were turning a profit. Amid a global pandemic GME manages to hold onto revenue and contain losses, they even came close to a profit in Q420 with only $20mm in losses down from $84mm in Q419--amid a global pandemic with Q420 ending in October and not including holiday sales.

Look at UBER and SNAP. In 2020, UBER had $14.15bn in revenue AND $8.6 BILLION IN LOSSES yet currently $113bn market cap. OVER VALUED TRASH WITH HUGE LOSSES. Or SNAP. In 2020 it had $2.5bn in revenue, $945mm in losses and currently has $94bn market cap. OVER VALUED TRASH WITH HUGE LOSSES. 

If GME is over valued trash like these smart buys then it must be valued at $100bn, maybe $50bn. But wait, GME market cap rests at a modest $3.4bn. WTF?? So you mean to say GME's revenues are 2x its stock market value while closing in on losses but UBER and SNAP are killer buys with $100bn market cap with no end to their bleeding $$. THE EXPERTS SAY ITS BECAUSE THE SHIFT TO DIGITAL!!!

>The ‚Äúshift to digital‚Äù thesis is way overblown. - u/deepfuckingvalue

The financial news screams at us saying digital has killed brick in mortar, blah blah blah, we live inside computers now--see PROOF we are on WSB ALL DAY!! If brick and mortar were dead then why would Amazon purchase Whole Foods? Why do companies like PELOTON have retail stores ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY? Why did e-commerce sales only represent 11% of all retail sales in the US in 2019? BECAUSE THE SHIFT TO DIGITAL IS WAY OVERBLOW BULLSHIT THEY FEED US.

GME has losses, sure, but they are containing costs with revenue exceeds their entire stock market value. GME is bringing in loads of $$ and their nearly contained losses are way under leading trash-buy stocks like UBER and SNAP. Brick and mortar is alive even in a pandemic--just wait until after the pandemic. People like to visit shops and get their buy on quickly--that's why AMZ bought Whole Foods and online retail only represents a fraction of brick and mortar retail sales. GME is not going anywhere anytime soon. GME is undervalued compared to the rest of the trash on the overvalued market. That's why I'm holding, will stop looking at the ticker price, and will no longer join in discussion about GME on WSB.

PLTR is an amazing opportunity rn. I did a DD on here for Nio when it was around  $39. Today was a bad day and we're still over 60. It doesn't make me more credible per se, but hear me out. 

I'm a catalyst trader. I go in before huge events. PLTR has an upcoming catalyst, and a compelling reason for the stonk price to be super high in the lead up to earnings.

**Catalyst:** PLTR's earnings is scheduled before market on Tuesday, 16th. 

**I. What happened before?**   
1) On November 12, PLTR's Q3 earnings was a whopping +125% surprise. Stonk prices skyrocked in the following weeks.   


2) On January 26, PLTR had a Live Demo Day. The stonk prices went from 26 to 39 leading up to Demo day, and then all the way up to 45 after Demo Day.   


**Thesis:** PLTR's scheduled events tend to pump the stonk prices in the build up and in the aftermath as well.  


**II. Earnings are volatile. Why play this one?**   
**A) Incentives:**  
PLTR's share lockout expiration happens days after earnings. Better earnings, equals better stonk prices, equals a better payout for those with the stock options. It's much more logical to pump the price up (legally through enthusiasm, etc) because the expiration will tank the price anyway, even if it's the bottom. 

I was offered share options from a startup once and understand the psychology of how this works. Imagine waiting for years to have your shares worth something, secondly, imagine owning tens-of-thousands of shares that you could just sell and become an overnight millionaire. If you never had a million dollars before, you wouldn't really care about timing the sale tbh, unless you're DFV (I don't think he works for PLTR). So the lockout expiration will very likely lead to a temporary selloff.  


**B) IV**  
The IV for PLTR is high. If you buy calls, buy leaps. I'm buying calls because I'm an autist. But if you wanna play it safe, do something else. Like play iron condor. Or just sell puts. Or ignore IV, buy shares, sell calls at the top. You'll have to time the top during/after earnings, but sell before the IV Crush. You could literally go about this in so many different ways and still make money.   


**C) Solid Performance and Partnerships**  
IBM, Rio Tinto, Cathie Wood's addition of shares, Blackrock's increase of shares, and a potential Facebook partnership. To be honest, the FB partnership rumor is probably fake, but, there was promise of another announcement near earnings. 

**TLDR -** I don't normally play earnings, but PLTR seems like a great play rn with many different opportunities.   
I apologize if I'm wrong about an earnings beat. I'm not a psychic. But I believe in the long term--this guy's going to 100+. So buy leaps and shares._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ ROXG.TO Due Diligence. This is my only mining stock and I am quite bullish on it, here's why. Roxgold Inc., a GOLD mining company (can't go wrong with Gold!), engages in acquiring, exploring, and evaluating mineral properties. Holds interest the Yaramoko gold project located in Burkina Faso; and 100% interest in S√©gu√©la gold project, which include 11 mineral exploration permits situated in C√¥te d‚ÄôIvoire. The company is headquartered in Toronto, Canada.   


According to a Businesswire Article ([link](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210201005267/en/)): "A year ago, Roxgold announced the discovery of the Boussoura Project and has since drilled over 150 holes with consistent assay returns demonstrating broad intersections of mineralization with lower grade halos surrounding higher grade quartz veins ‚Äì characteristic of the style of mineralization found within the prolific Hound√© Gold Belt. The Boussoura Project is still in its early days, yet we are growing more confident in the scale of this project, with a large land package host to numerous veined corridors running over extensive strike lengths and with numerous targets identified between Fofora and Galgouli with similar geochemistry and geophysical anomalies. We will continue to keep the drills turning at Boussoura, as we look to continue to expand and define the mineralized footprint towards the goal of a maiden resource by year end."

I had my friend (in the geology field) to look over their assay results and he's let me know that they are fairly significant.  


You may be concerned about mining in Africa, especially a country like BF. This is a valid concern, governments have not always been favorable to mining in Africa. It seems however, that BF has switched gears and is starting to move in a positive direction, the country has even eliminated a 10% tax on mining operations.

This is not financial advice. Simply sharing my DD and would like to hear what you have to say about it.

  
**TLDR: I like the stock and see rocket ships in the future. Their current and future financials look very good and the calculations show that this stock is extremely undervalued by about 80%.**_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Deepest Value Stock Near Book Value Rdy for a Squeeze ($UWMC) First off, the obligatory, I used to be a financial analyst, but this is not financial advice and you should do your own DD.


Like my hero DFV, my bread and butter is to invest in extremely undervalued value companies in this frothy market environment with vix spikes happening every few days. If you follow DFV and watch his vids, you'll know that he bought GME for its value, and the gamma/short squeeze was icing.


This might be a long post, so skip to TLDR if you don't care about market logic. To begin, why is the #1 wholesale & purchase mortgage lender in USA so cheap you might ask? Well, I can't give you any one particular reason, but GHIV was one of the biggest spacs merger ever, and it might have suffered from the a spac speculative life cycle, and the shorts are in control, and oh boy, are they in control. Money these days have been flowing from GME/AMC and the like to weed, looking for whatever the next trend is--Twitter or not (yes, Zack Morris and the Atlas crew also love UWMC, and their cost basis is a lot higher than today's price).


It is borderline shameful how low this stock is, I mean I like me some FUTU and SNDL too, but I'd have to make it a point to check futures along w/ my midnight pee sessions if I were to dump my entire portfolio in those names. This thing has a **tangible book value of $7.75/sh**, that means if the company's financials were horrible, and they made no money, and decided to declare bankruptcy, and after they liquidate all their assets to satisfy their debt, shareholders will get back $7.75/sh. But no, their financials and balance sheet are immaculate, and they absolutely smashed earnings, originating 54.7B in loan volume, up 71% y/y, with a 4th qtr net income of  $1.37B vs. 108.72M (that's billion vs. million) in the same qtr last year,  and FY20 net income of  $3.38B, an **821%** and **715%** increase over 4Q19 and FY19, respectively.


Also, during the earnings call, they declared a dividend of $.40/yr, as of today's price, this is a **4.5% div. yield** with ex. div date on 3/9. Their EBITDA growth has outpaced their top line revenue growth, which signifies a margin expansion. They are getting more profitable every year, with good guidance on their call. Their forward P/E was 6.21 this morning, compared to that of RKT at $10.94. UWMC should be at a good value of around **$16.5** if we use RKT as a fair comp, although I would argue that RKT is slightly undervalued as well.


**Short Interest:**

As of yesterday, it had a short interest of **36.2%** with only 50k shares available to short at a 7.9% fee. When I tried to short 1 share on IBKR this morning, there were none available. I don't normally pick stocks based on short interest, but like DFV, this is an added icing for a major squeeze. It also has a short ratio of about 1.6, so it'll take at least 1.6 days for shorts to cover if there is a day of pure buys. The higher the ratio means more covering with higher volume spikes, which brings in more buyers.

The option flow on this is absolutely bonkers with 45k calls and 2k puts, there are gargantuan gamma ramps at 10, 12.5, 15, and 17, with $15 being the largest at every expiry. Once volume picks up and people realize how undervalued this stock is, it will quickly ramp to 15 via MM's delta hedging.


**Ownership:**

This is 34% instutionally owned with Phoenix Holding buying 2.5M shares today, making them 5.88% owners of the company. After today's buy, I would expect that institutionally owned number to reach 40%.


**Max Pain:**

I posted a DD on PCG a while ago and I rode it up from $8.50 to $13, so I understand how these stocks are artificially suppressed. PCG had a larger institutional ownership at around 80%, and it was curious to me how every opex date ended right around max pain. So even if that were the case here, max pain is at $10 on Feb 19, with the next lower strike ($7.5) losing 184.72% of contract value vs the next higher strike ($12.5) losing only 59.839%. I am fairly confident this will be above $10 by then.

**TA:**

UWMC is at the bottom of a channel with a lot of support from hfs buying anything below today. It is trading very near their book/NAV, and I think today's Phoenix 2.5m, a new 5.88% position will get some eyes on this gem. I have no doubt it will run up for ex-div date as well. There is bullish divergence and I see volume coming in the next few days. My personal price target is at $25-$30 within a year, and this constitutes as a long term hold for me.


**Tech:**
One of the things I like the most is their mobile app that gives independent brokers the ability to underwrite a loan from open to close, their companion app can pull credit reports, get e-sigs, and act as a point of sale and loan origination system. If they make it user assessible to retail clients, like how they do it in Asia with BEKE, I can see a big bottom-line bonus here.


**TLDR:**

**Heavily shorted, highly undervalued, hf darling with a book/sh of $7.74 trading at a forward p/e of only 6.21. My position: Breaking my rule of 2-5% allocation per ticker; 60% of my portfolio in shares @ 9.70s average; 10, 12.5, 15 calls.**_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ I'm on for $ON ON Semiconductors. 

We all know we're in a current market shortage of semiconductors. You can see this in the retail markets with GPU and CPU shortages, but we also have a shortage in the industrial sectors too. Our modern economy is rife with robots and computers everywhere from factories to your living room. All of those electronics need semiconductors and chips. 

$ON makes Memory, they make audio processors, they make LCD drivers, they make switches, sim card readers, thermal sensors, light readers, motor drivers, DC regulator, and USB controllers. [They make all the shit that makes robots work,](https://www.onsemi.com/products) and they make custom solutions too. 

We all know that robots are taking over our jobs, and that robots have been storming manufacturing for the last decade. Now $ON sits on a huge demand for these parts because the other companies like MU and TSM are spending all their resources trying to meet the big GPU and CPU demands. 

Other manufacturing is getting left behind in the semiconductor shortage. We still need automotive robot arms to build new cars, whether they're green or gas. We still need logic and power solutions for every manufacturing or appliance part that needs to move. That means assembly line robots, it means motor controls for cnc machines and shop equipment, it means the power solution for your oven and microwave, it even means the GFCI controller that stops you from ending it all after you lost it on GME when you tried to bathe with the toaster, which uses a power switch, which are made by $ON. 

But don't take my word for it. Look at it's charts. 
[here's the 3 month.](https://i.imgur.com/YDuwykA.png?1)
[here's the 6 month.](https://i.imgur.com/RZo5uTD.png?1)
[and here's all time.](https://i.imgur.com/2t0uzLA.png?1)

This thing is primed to go, and already creeping up steadily on the fundamentals. It's already a mainstream company in the manufacturing world, a big name. I think its primed to continue to moon as the current shortage deepens with the ever increasing advancement to smaller and smaller nanonmeter fabrication techniques by the GPU and CPU manufacturers.

EDIT: Overall we had a good day, yes, it is very difficult to hold when a stock rocks up 10% and then comes down 5%. So if you sold and made your profit, good on you, if you help, God Speed Autist

Been a member for about a year and seen some great DD, so about time I do one of my own. It might be a bit long, so a summary upfront:

**AMKR ‚Äì Amkor Technology** \- is an undervalued stock in the semi-conductor space, which is going to be a super-hot sector in 2021 and beyond. The stock has great financials and the P/E ratio is killer, even better than any of your established boomer stocks.  The company has a market cap of 5B on revenues of $5B

This is not a get rich quick scheme or a pump and dump. Invest wisely and this one should rise gradually during the year.

Position ‚Äì 16c , 3/19 and 24c 3/19 and 2k shares. I got into the stocks couple of weeks back when it was at $16

Now that is out of the way, lets get to it.

**What do you look for in a great DD:**

1. Company is in a growing space that is hot at the moment
2. Financials are solid
3. Outlook is great
4. Company is a bit of an unknown and undervalued
5. There is an upcoming catalyst

Before I get into each, let me simply tell you what AMKR does. The company provides testing and packaging services to semi-conductor companies. So it works with companies that need to develop chips for your 5G phones, for your future EV Lambos. Basically it provides critical services to companies that manufacture or deal in semi conductors. The company is based in the USA and has big players like Qualcomm, Sony, AMD etc as its customers.

So now lets get to it:

&#x200B;

1. ***Company is in a growing space that is hot at the moment.***

Unless you have been hiding under the rock, semi-conductors are hot at the moment. There are multiple catalysts, from 5G phones roll out, to the EV wave, to more cloud computing, everything needs processing power. This means more demand for semi-conductors, in fact there is already a significant shortage being seen across the board. This is a hot sector to be in the moment. Don‚Äôt believe me here you go:

[https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/10/whats-causing-the-chip-shortage-affecting-ps5-cars-and-more.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/10/whats-causing-the-chip-shortage-affecting-ps5-cars-and-more.html)

[https://www.ft.com/content/6caf7028-cae1-44f3-9bc2-7dc2d47a23ef](https://www.ft.com/content/6caf7028-cae1-44f3-9bc2-7dc2d47a23ef)

Everything in this sector is running at full capacity. More production means more testing and packaging and this shit is not going to slow down anytime soon.

&#x200B;

***2.*** ***Financials are solid***

I can more with you all the details in the world, on how the company is constantly reducing it‚Äôs debt and increasing operating income or how it recently announced it is going to start giving dividends, but I am going to focus on one metric. P/E ratio.

While I was typing up this DD the P/E ratio of this company is 15.91. So is that good or bad, well to put it in context, Apple is 36.57 and Microsoft is is 36.35. Even your boomer stock PepsiCo is at 26.7.

Okay, but what about other companies in this space. TSM the biggest player in this space is at 62.17. Another favourite of this reddit, UMC 78.63, QCOM 24.81. AMAT, probably the closest to their business 28.79

Like I said, that metric alone tell you how criminally undervalued this company is.  Even a P/E ratio of 25, which would put it in the low end of the range, would shoot its price past $30

&#x200B;

***3. Outlook is great:***

Well, I am not going to say much, but just copy paste the closing statement from the last earnings call:

‚ÄúOkay. Well, thank you very much. Before closing the call, I would like to recap a few key messages. 2020 was a remarkable year for Amkor. We generated over $5 billion in revenue and $1.40 per share, and initiate cash dividend program for our stockholders. We accomplished this while navigating through a challenging global pandemic. We are expecting the first quarter of 2021 to be another solid quarter with revenue of $1.32 billion at the mid-point of our guidance.

2021 is expected to be another growth year for Amkor. Semiconductor market forecasts predict growth of around 9% for the year. With Amkor‚Äôs position in key growth markets, we expect to outgrow the semi-market forecast in 2021‚Äù

UMC has a revenue of $5bn and a valuation of $25B which is 4X of this company!AMAT as 3.5 times the revenue and 20X the valuation

Also to recap their 2020 highlights

Full Year 2020 Highlights:

Net sales $5.05 billion, up 24.6% year on yearNet income $338 million, earnings per diluted share $1.40EBITDA $960 millionNet cash from operations $770 million and free cash flow $221 million

Sixth consecutive year of positive free cash flow

Financial information on the company:

[https://ir.amkor.com/static-files/4052c2a2-2944-4563-88b2-6a6c928ae302](https://ir.amkor.com/static-files/4052c2a2-2944-4563-88b2-6a6c928ae302)

&#x200B;

***4. Company is bit of an unknown and undervalued***

I mean, come on, everyone talks about TSM, AMAT, UMC, but has anyone every mentioned this company? It is literally the definition of an unknown.

Undervalued, it is CRIMINALLY undervalued compared to it peers. Look at the P/E ratio, literally better than anyone else. Its revenue to valuation ratio, literally better than anyone else. I mean I don‚Äôt know what else to say. This speaks BUY BUY BUY!

I mean, this company should have a valuation of at least $10B, which would shoot its price past $40

&#x200B;

*5.* ***There is upcoming catalyst***

Well company just become a strong buy on Zacks, but there is a bigger catalyst coming up on Feb 16th, which is the reason for some price action today:

[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amkor-technology-set-join-p-232600920.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amkor-technology-set-join-p-232600920.html)

**The company is going to join the S&P Mid Cap 400 on Feb 16th.** This is probably the reason why the stock moved so much today.

This alone will bring more capital into the company. More and more people will look into this company and realize the absurd valuation compared to its peers and yes this rill rise more. Today was just the start of what might happen over the next week

&#x200B;

**TLDR:**

Yes I know the stock has doubled in the last 6 months and jumped 20% today, but

1. The outlook is better than ever in company‚Äôs history
2. They delivered their best ever quarter and will even pay dividends
3. The financial ratios are best in class, even better than all your boomer stocks
4. Based on the revenue and ratios alone the company should be valued at least 2X what it is today
5. Company is in the super hot semi-conductor space
6. There is an upcoming catalyst on Feb 16th - S&P 400 Mid-Cap inclusion
7. Another stock being mentioned here ON has the same revenue and income and is valued 3X more. if you think that is  a great play, which it is, think about this one!
8. The volume is lowish, but again I see that as a positive as this will climb quickly once there is interest. The avg volume on this stock is 1M, it was 5M today and already 700k after hours

I am balls deep on 24c, 3/19, which was looking risky two days ago, but it looks juicy as fuck now.

As always do your DD, and enjoy the tendies!

I am no financial advisor, but some guy who thinks we all can make money from this GEM

üöÄ  üöÄ  üöÄ  üöÄ  üöÄ  üöÄ  üöÄ  üöÄ  üöÄ  üöÄ  üöÄ  üöÄ  üöÄ  üöÄ  üöÄ  üöÄ  üöÄ  üöÄ  üöÄ  üöÄ  üöÄ  üöÄ  üöÄ_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ PSA: Don‚Äôt throw good money after bad To all novice investors now frequenting this sub, here‚Äôs some helpful advice. It‚Äôs a trap to continue investing in your losing positions. If you‚Äôre a bagholder, the way out is not to funnel more funds into a sinking stock, averaging down. The better strategy is to invest in other stocks with clear upward momentum and trends. Use gains to offset your losses. Diversify your portfolio for better results.

It sucks being a bag holder. I know the feeling. I owned CCL for the dividend before Covid. Then the pandemic crushed the cruise lines and my position. Suddenly I was down 70% on the stock. But I did not invest another dollar into CCL since the health crisis began. Instead of averaging down, I put that money to better use in stocks that could benefit from the pandemic and economic recovery. Subsequently, I‚Äôve enjoyed an incredible past year, making a ton of money while leaving my CCL loss in the rearview mirror. 

Throwing good money after bad is a self-defeating move. Remember: the point of investing is to *make money* ‚Äî not gradually lose more and more of it in a position that‚Äôs clearly shrinking in value. Invest in winners, not losers.

This is not professional financial advice. Do what you will, of course. I just hate seeing newer folks lose money when they don't have to. We all come here to see green in our portfolios. You can, too._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ HYLN is going to be another lesson in FOMO Like all of you, I get excited when something rockets. But I take the minute to do DD. 

If you read this release: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hyliion-introduces-next-generation-battery-182300641.html

You'll see:

1. They are using Toshiba cells, not their own.
2. Cooling batteries is known to make them charge faster and have greater efficiency.

This is not next gen. It's a new battery cooler. I'm sure it's cool, but it's not 1 billion in market cap cool.

I went heavy on puts. This isn't just mouthing off. 
I'll post gain or lose porn accordingly.

Edit: I read more and did more DD.
They have -27 P/E
The tech is for class 8 trucks, which again, while cool, aren't in production from a brief look, but rather they are in early stages.

Again,  just not impressed.

Edit 2: looking at older articles about them.

That they look bad for having now institutional ownership.

That they are not 'in it for the long haul https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hyliion-isn-t-long-haul-200100050.html

They will under perform for 2021

Defending them using warrants.

Eesh. I'm gonna buy more puts.

Edit 3: Thanks for the gold. Also, you gotta see who is an autist and who is the retard. The autists do DD, post value, and know how stuff works. The autist bail in and make money of they listen to the autists. Right now that ratio is messed up. But it'll get fixed.

Edit 4: position https://i.imgur.com/1JrLJnE.png


Edit 5: GME still has a new CEO and is doing PCs. Are there bagholders? APHA and TLRY are still merging, are there gonna be bag holders?

Edit 6: the more I read the more I think this company is total crap. They burned people with vaporware a year ago, they have no deliverables or direct path to profit. And if you look through the bulk of the articles in the last year almost all day things like "if you're looking for an EV play this isn't it".  I'm going so far as to say if you hold this it's because of sink cost fallacy and cognitive dissonance, or just fucking cognitive impairment. Plus they got to NASDAQ cause they are a SPAC which is a cheat code for garbage companies to get on real exchanges.

Rocket Companies reports earnings Feb 25. Everyone is well aware of the booming market for homes in the suburbs. In my neck of the woods in CT, where I have been house shopping, homes get sold insanely fast. But I have no expertise as in investor or trader in this sector. I assume $RKT is killing it because they are the leading mortgage lender in the US, but will the volume convert to profits? Are there are some specific indicators that might be a hint to their results coming up? 

Stock has pretty much been flatling since their post IPO spike and drop. 18-23 range for 4 months or so now._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $AMKR gapped up today but I think it's still undervalued Amkor is a semiconductor packaging company. Boring af. Think cardboard company selling boxes to Amazon. But they've got: 
-solid earnings track record ($1.39/s TTM)
-low PE (9.18 FWD looking)
-upward trajectory earnings estimates ($1.69/s projected this year)
-a large portion of the market share selling B2B in an industry that has been killing it for years.

I usually skip on companies that beat earnings and gap up cause I figure I missed the boat. But I think this still has room to run. They've broken out of the 20 day SMA on the news this week of an earnings beat (Monday) that they will be added to the S&P midcap 400 (yesterday). **This means index etfs will start scooping up shares.** And Citi analyst price target increases today to $15 from $13 https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-amkor-technology-stock-just-jumped-again-2021-02-11

Granted it's currently trading well above that higher price target but it seems analysts are rarely willing to reach ahead of an uptrending stock, and they just follow it up with trailing estimates. What's more important is the fact that they found reason to move it at all.

Do your research, tell me why I'm wrong. I am long shares._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Welcome to the casino _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $EWJ - JOIN MICHAEL BURRY IN AN ETF WITH CONCRETE POSITIVE GROWTH Earlier this week, our beloved Dr. Michael Burry (the dude who predicted the housing crisis, the dude who predicted GME, the dude who predicts fucking everything honestly), tweeted about Japan finally lifting their ‚Äúiron coffin lid‚Äù as he called it. While this tweet is now deleted, as Burry frequently wipes his Twitter, it led me down a hole which I believe to have discovered a golden opportunity. This ‚Äúiron coffin lid‚Äù of Japan‚Äôs has been rumored to break free for a while now, but hasn‚Äôt. 

[https://moneyweek.com/476357/the-charts-that-matter-can-japan-lift-the-iron-coffin-lid](https://moneyweek.com/476357/the-charts-that-matter-can-japan-lift-the-iron-coffin-lid) 

[https://www.economicperspectives.co.uk/japanese-equities-can-the-coffin-lid-be-lifted.html](https://www.economicperspectives.co.uk/japanese-equities-can-the-coffin-lid-be-lifted.html) 

Yet, Burry believes the time has finally come. As such he is heavenly invested in Japanese corporations. 

An excerpt from Burry‚Äôs tweet: ‚Äú#ironcoffinlid opening? If so, the contents are the likes of which are never seen in the western world.‚Äù

This led me to find, $EWJ. An ETF consisting of **85% OF JAPAN‚ÄôS STOCKS**. (That‚Äôs a lot!). No, you didn't read that wrong. Not 85% of EWJ consists of Japanese stock, EWJ consists of roughly 85% of the investible universe of securities traded in Japan. 

Some of the top companies that they hold the majority of their equity in include:

**NINTENDO**

**SONY**

**TOYOTA**

**MITSUBISHI**

**TOKYO ELECTRON**

**SOFTBANK GROUP**

I mean wow, what a stacked top contenders list.

**Nintendo only has positive year after year growth**, and after the revolution of the Switch, they are back on their feet with eyes forward. 

**Sony only has positive year after year growth.** Sony is a company that pioneers technology in all aspects, video-games, TV, music, etc. 

**Toyota only has positive year after year growth.** I expect this to skyrocket as well as we transition to the age of EVs. *Earlier this week Toyota announced their electric vehicles are coming THIS YEAR. Toyota also recently partnered with PANASONIC to manufacture their batteries for said EVs.* 

**While Mitsubishi has had their ups and downs, we still see a net positive year after year return.** Mitsubishi is Japan‚Äôs *LARGEST TRADING COMPANY. With HIGH POSITIVE OUTLOOK FOR THE FUTURE IN 2022+ AS THEY MOVE INTO EVs AS WELL.*

**Tokyo Electron** **only has positive year after year growth**. Going from a penny stock to $100 in less than 5 years, Tokyo Electron is looking like a very serious worldwide company moving forward. Founded in 1963, Tokyo Electron has been a manufacturer of ***semiconductors***, technology for the future that they have been pioneering for 50 YEARS NOW. You know all the people spamming $ON on here? That is a semiconductor play as well. This is just a safer gateway into that industry.

**SoftBank Group only has positive year after year growth.** Softbank is *THE WORLD‚ÄôS LARGEST TECHNOLOGY FOCUSED VENTURE CAPITAL FUND, WITH OVER 100 BILLION DOLLARS IN CAPITAL.* 

These 6 are simply a very small few of EWJ‚Äôs top holdings. As you can see the road ahead is bright, almost blinding. EWJ took a dip during COVID, but is now coming out of that hole stronger and faster. If we take a look at EWJ‚Äôs chart we can see a lot of consistent breakout patterns occurring recently, lining up with Burry‚Äôs idea. 

Let‚Äôs take a look at the covid dip:

![img](uzamwpn52rg61 "
")

As we can see in early 2020 when we saw covid happen, the 100-day average passed downward through the 20-day average, as we spiral down. **However, we then see one of the quickest recoveries ever during the pandemic** as already in April the 20 day average passes through the 100 day and we begin our flight to the moon.

I decided to snoop around WSB and see if anyone else was talking about this. I stumbled upon u/ThePoorLad‚Äôs post where he also notes a breakout pattern. His image below:

https://preview.redd.it/n940mw4c2rg61.jpg?width=1075&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=21596b94408506af11a5e4d6194aea781644fca2

Yet, let's continue snooping around EWJ‚Äôs graph and see if we find anything worth paying attention to..

As you can see, this week we have a very prevailing and very bullish staircase pattern, this following Burry‚Äôs tweet, seems to be the beginning of EWJ‚Äôs true soar to 100+. 

The options for EWJ have little to no volume. They are cheap as fuck. This is a stock no one fucking knows about. It just seems like a random Japan ETF, ‚Äúwho would want to get in on that?‚Äù No one realizes what's about to happen, (except our boy Burry). This is a golden opportunity to get in before the crowd.

Every huge company in the world is missing semiconductors: "companies like Apple, Qualcomm, Sony, and AMD have all cited shortages in recent weeks, with effects ranging from part shortages for iPhones to the incredibly hard-to-find nature of the PlayStation 5 or AMD‚Äôs newest CPUs and GPUs. But in today‚Äôs increasingly connected world, a shortage of semiconductor chips impacts not only traditional technology industries, but also a wide-ranging list of other industries. Numerous automotive companies ‚Äî including Volkswagen, Fiat Chrysler, and Toyota ‚Äî have been forced to temporarily suspend vehicle production over the past several months. And Ford just announced that it would be pausing manufacturing on its most lucrative F-150 trucks earlier this month in the wake of chip shortages."

All these companies are just begging for more semi-conductors, and $ON and others are almost completely out. When production starts ramping up again the huge demand will increase their earnings even more: THIS IS A LONG AND SHORT PLAY.

The MM (Market Manipulation fyi) on top of the over-fixation of the Lockup and the bi-polar MKT have really been the biggest things that have stopped [$PLTR](https://stocktwits.com/symbol/PLTR) fucking cold from climbing higher up the mountain.

Nobody really seems to really be prioritizing the ER on Tuesday. And with how deep down we've gone in the rabbit hole, it isn't really helping our case to just "be faithful" and "BTFD" for these Shorters/soon to be. Everyone's just focused on the next Catalyst 3 days after it which is going to Pullback on the price - for the short term. So possible Holders are waiting on that before buying in and myopic Bulls are selling because "it isn't $40 fml" and are reacting to the sudden drops + Lockup as their confirmation.

Don't get me wrong, ER is still significant. There still is hype around it that isn't just going to vanish. And with how badly PLTR has dropped since yesterday (back to the old ATH), then some people are going to be a bit interested; cheap shares, cheap calls right. So some positive volume can come from that. But understand, whatever happens there/tmrw will define how next week is going to go into the Lockup as Monday is closed off due to being a holiday. They will be the impetuses, if good or bad, for the weekly trend basically.

Still, this type of plunge manifests despite huge contracts being signed left and right, with no Bear signals/bad news against it other than valuation, which is as irrelevant as it has ever been in this warped MKT. The IBM deal which was a huge deal for Palantir... wiped away in 2 days, like all the other deals, trounced. Bull Catalysts, which should build hype for ER - the biggest Bull Catalyst of all - don't mean jack and it "surprisingly" goes into the Red big time, the opposite of what should occur.

Really the manipulation on this stock is beyond apparent. The hate against it is well documented and it dates back to the start when they opened the way Big Daddy Institutions didn't want. When "MM" is really the only major thing that can be said about going against such an initially great Bull Run + why it's doing what it's doing, then you know something has to be a little wonky internally. It's not natural.

But really, ain't much we can do about it. At this point, I said to go for the ER but with how bad of a spot we're in, idek what to say. Really if you're not Long/Deep in the Money and you're just a newb who wants to get in, really I say just wait it out. Palantir is so volatile and irrationally controlled that anything could really happen from now until the Lockup.

And look, this is a great company, with great tech. It's a great hold for the Long and years down the road. But in the short term, it's going through these violent financial assaults constantly, and it throws the stock back down as soon it somewhat starts to shoot up into the sky. It really isn't all the stable right now. But for those who know PLTR, follow the routine, it ain't gonna change and that's a fact. For those who still don't know how it goes in its way up the mountain? It is what it is.

This is the way._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Scorpio Tankers YOLO Update - OIL RECOVERY BABY üöÄüíé _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ The Retail Trader Wave  

These last few weeks have been bizarre in terms of the stock market and it has left me at a complete lost as to what "up & coming" companies to put my money on at the moment. I am feeling that I would like to outline my running thesis as to what has been going on.

The GME gamma squeeze has changed a whole lot. Probably this is just a short term distrubance, though it could be a continual change, I really don't know.

\*\*So what has happened?\*\*

\*\*Part 1 - Gamestop\*\*

Gamestop and its prophesied gamma squeeze awoke the hoard. Tens, if not hundreds of thousands of newby traders exploded out onto the freshly burgeoning retail trading platforms to take advantage of the promise of riches beyond belief.

You see a rumour began to spread that the ruling financial elites had gotten greedy, they had over extended, and trapped themselves in an unwinnable situation. How lucky we all now were. We simply needed to buy up these shares and we would soar to the moon carried by a rocket, powered by the elites lost money. It was irresistible. It was a promise not only of immense wealth, but also of destroying those that had destroyed others so many times.

This, of course, didn't end as most people expected. The elites escaped their fate. The early traders made millions, most won minor amounts and some lost more then they could.

\*\*Part 2 - The Fallout\*\*

So, suddenly the market had become open to a hoard of fresh traders that had gotten a taste, a teaser of what they could make from a hobby in stock trading. They had only two questions on their mind "What stocks are the next GME?" & "Which of these winning stocks can I afford and win the most?".

These two questions inevitably led them to one place... THE PENNY STOCKS! (also stocks under about $30) Though, most of them couldn't access all penny stocks, just those penny stocks that are avaliable on most standard trading platforms.

\*\*Part 3 - Thesis\*\*

I am doing away with the story like tone of this now, though I hope you enjoyed that.

Essentially, A ton middle class people that don't have ridiclous amounts of money surged into the market and have all been trying to guess the next GME/Big thing and many have just been following trends on mass. The issue with this is there is currently "seemingly" high quality DD posts being made of virtually every widely avaliable stock under $10, and of many stocks that are a bit higher than $10.

I imagine, because of this, many people might be experiencing the same problems as me now.

1. It is much harder to tell which low cost stocks are actually potentially good long term investments and which are riding the hype wave and new trader wave.
2. Many of the potentially good long term stocks have shot way past what there forecast long term gains had been. So, I am left wondering how far they will recede back, if at all, and when should i buy back in.

I am curious what the take of other traders on here are about handling this situation?

Personally these are the steps I have taken.

I have benefited with a small amount of winnings both from GME & from weed stocks as well as some of the other penny stock gains. I have taken all of my money out of these sort of plays temporarily and moved most of it into safer long term investments. Most into a few different ETF's, some into SQ, Microsoft, Apple.

Though I have kept a small amount ( an amount I have no problem loosing) and I chucked it into a Tanzanian gold company stock, "why", you may ask, "have you moved stocks into a strange unimpressive tanzanian gold mining company?" simply because it was one of the last widely accesbile(that is to say avaliable on most amatuer trading platforms) penny stocks under $1, I suspect it may move up simply because of how cheap it is. Stocks under $1 seem, at least temporarily, to be soaring for the simple fact of being under $1._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Adaptability makes HYLN a diamond in the rough [DD] **TLDR: Hyliion is a gateway drug to EV and their adaptability in the Class 8 industry makes them a great long term play with deep fucking valueüöÄ.**

It seems like everyday there is a new company coming out of the woodworks with a plan for hydrogen fuel cell trucks or fully electric powertrains. While the Biden administration has certainly added some fuel to the EV fire, everyone (including that gay üåàüêª Mark Delaney from GS) seems to be sleeping on a company that is poised to succeed no matter what renewable energy solution is chosen.

While still in its early stages as a company after going public (via S word) in late 2020, Hyliion (HYLN), provides **full powertrain solutions** for fleets through 2 main products:

1. **Hybrid Diesel or CHG** ‚Äì as the name states this is an electric hybrid powertrain with either Diesel or renewable natural gas. There are some interesting differences between the diesel & CNG options, but we‚Äôll save that for another time. These **powertrains are available now** and they have been shipping in low volumes this year with volume expected to increase throughout the year. The great thing with this solution is it can be **installed on most major Class 8 trucks with no additional driver training**.
2. **Hypertruck ERX** ‚Äì this is the secret sauce that our buddy Thomas Healy will (IMO) change the world with. This is a fuel agnostic, fully electric powertrain that uses an **onboard generator** powered by RNG (for now) to locally charge the truck. This reduces the need for a large battery pack that cuts into the payload capacity of the truck while also extending the range of the truck to well over **1,000** **miles.** Hyliion has already partnered with American Natural Gas (ANG) to ensure they can not only meet the demand for RNG, but they can leverage this partnership to offer fleets better pricing across the country.

These two products provide HYLN the adaptability needed in these uncertain times. Right now, their approach is to go with RNG since the infrastructure is already there across the country & it is ready to be rolled out in full production by 2022. üåàüêª Mark Delaney must have had Elon‚Äôs cock in his ear during the last Tesla earnings call, because he seemed to miss him saying ‚Äúit would not make sense for us to do the Semi right now, but it will absolutely make sense for us to do it as soon as we can address the cell production constraint‚Äù. Never doubt Elon, but it doesn‚Äôt sound like they will be in full production with the Semi by 2022 (even if they plan to build a plant in NV this year). With that being said, Hyliion is already producing & selling their Hybrid solution, with the hope to launch demo ERX with fleets this year, while starting production in 2022.

Which brings us to the most important question, how are they manufacturing these things? Unlike building their own plants, which has its own pros/cons, HYLN is partnering with others. This accelerates the timeline of getting products to the market and allows them to **focus on what they are good at.**

***Isn‚Äôt the increased demand in Hydrogen fuel cell a concern for a company that is focused on RNG***\*\*?\*\* No and no. Everyone loves to talk about hydrogen but no one seems to be realistic about when it will be ready. Aside from the lack of infrastructure across the country that will take years to build out, the cost of hydrogen is more than **10x higher than natural gas**. Not only are the costs higher, but the way a majority of hydrogen is currently being produced is coming from steam methane which is more pollutive than a diesel truck. AND even if all of those negatives were solved by next year, Hyliion is still working on a hydrogen solution (in addition to RNG) for their onboard generators for the Hypertruck. Essentially they have you covered if you want to go the RNG route or Hydrogen (when ready).

***The cost of Diesel is below $3, will this affect the appetite for companies to adopt EV?*** [According to Healy](https://event.webcasts.com/viewer/event.jsp?ei=1425939&tp_key=75b5f9e241), with diesel at $3 there is a **2 year payback period** for fleet operators. Obviously as prices go lower this payback period increases, but most fleets have a 5-7 year lifespan so adding a year or two to the PP doesn‚Äôt have much of an impact considering the benefits.

***Price target?*** I am not a financial advisor, but I am a little autistic so I dug into [Hyliions original investor presentation](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1759631/000121390020015311/ea123187ex99-3_tortoiseacq.htm) from their pre-IPO. We haven‚Äôt really gotten any new updates to these numbers, but I still think this is a hidden gem based on their projections. Assuming the Hypertruck meets all of their expectations, they anticipate around 2% of the Class 8 market share by 2024 (a more than $94 billion addressable market). If they can reach EBITDA of $602m by 2024 as projected, then a price of $18/share should be the floor right now. However, with some good/bad news on the upcoming Feb 23 earnings call this could all change in an instant.

It is my belief that gold peaked in August 2020 and will continue to decline from current levels through the rest of this year.  Here are my reasons.  

1.  There is not enough inflation in the US dollar to drive prices up further.  
2. There is no shortage and never will be.  
3. The charts peaked in August and are now in pattern of making new low then recovering before making another new low.  
4. Gold is boomer shit.  People would rather buy digital coins, weed, or SPACs with their stimulus money.  
5. India/China are big importers for jewelry and increased prices have a big impact on demand.  
6. Interest rates aren't going up anytime soon.  
7. Gold is trading below falling 10, 20, 50 day moving averages.  
8. If economy booms, people will sell gold to buy better returning investments.
9. If economy gets worse, people will sell gold to buy other assets.

The group retardation is exponential when you also hear shit like "I'm down 100k but w/e we're still going to the moon". Not only retarded, but gluttons for punishment. It's as if losing money somehow temporarily "boosts" your group think morale before you reality sets in and you realize there's no way back out.   


Do you even know how a company is valuated? You can artificially pump all you want, it doesn't actually MAKE the company worth what you've inflated it to. I can't believe I have to explain this, but for serious investors in this who have done their DD, would project to sell at a set point (if they're risk averse). Anything beyond that point is pure volatility. a stock like SNDL would NEVER organically hit $100 with the current state of their business. Even with you retards pumping it up artificially, it would never hit $100 anyway because any reasonable person would start dumping once they see the kind of manipulation is at play. Case and point, the events of SNDL this fucking morning. Do you still think it'll go to $100?   


I used to take the word "retard" being thrown around here in jest; but now I'm pretty convinced that the folks ( as mentioned in my previous example above) are un-ironically retarded. 

Is this going to be the new thing now? Every Penny stock going to be pumped and dumped? You realize by doing this, you're no fucking better than the hedge funds you purportedly hate. You're acting as a hive mind to inflate then dump. This is why I think post GME, WSB has and will continue to decline unless something is done about this. 

So, for those actually looking to invest wisely here, if you ever see a penny stock being posted with no DD or futures to back it up, do yourself a favour and avoid the risk. Yes, you can probably get real lucky and ride the short term wave then dump, but if you're wanting to be a SERIOUS investor, just ignore the bullshit posted here.   


Making money is fun until you lose it all.  


On a more sober note, SNDL's futures are somewhat hopeful (my personal opinion) based on some POTENTIAL acquisitions, so I will be sticking around for a little bit. Am I taking a risk? Yes.

Panasonic. 

As you probably already know, Panasonic already has a deal with Tesla for batteries, however Musk wants to produce his own soon but that deal lasts until 2022 I believe. 

Just last year, Panasonic entered a [deal](https://www.forbes.com/sites/greggardner/2020/02/03/toyota-and-panasonic-launch-joint-ev-battery-venture/?sh=61a565dd4c3a) to jointly produce lithium ion batteries.

As EV vehicles come into prominence, I think Toyota's position will be unique as Toyota is consistent and dead set on quality. 

Panasonic is trading at $13 right now and I think it is a good buy that will pay off in the future.

Stop loss sales: stop loss sales are sett up to limit the amount of money you can lose b4 your stock auto sells. These are used to guarantee your minimum acceptable gains and get out b4 you hold the bag.

The stop loss sale executed at 2.89$ making me about 95$ before the stock plummeted to 2.20$ potentially eliminating all my gains. I'm a broke college student so I really needed that money for groceries/valentines day so I'm glad I did this.

The GME squeeze was a once in a lifetime opportunity, but all the newcomers that have flocked to our beloved short bus don‚Äôt seem to realize this. They are like crack whores giving blowies in the Wendy‚Äôs parking lot just looking for their next hit.

 As a result, we have been flooded with absolute dogshit DD and dogshit stock picks. This weed and penny stock pump has ‚Äúretarded new investor‚Äù written all over it. This was shit I thought of 4 years ago when I was still in high school beating my dick to porn on iFunny.

‚òÄÔ∏èSummary:‚òÄÔ∏è
- $SNDL being shorted
- They are now debt free, while others weed stocks are filled with debt. 
- SNDL has lots of potential and many plans of development
- +Weed (once fully legalüìà)
- under valued, compare other weed stonks, most around 5b market avg and yes those are for known companies but who‚Äôs to say SNDL won‚Äôt grow, so far they‚Äôve been making smart business decisions.
- This stock has actual real potential, long term goal of $10.


‚òÄÔ∏èCommon Questions?:‚òÄÔ∏è

- ‚ùìWhy is cannabis Shorted‚ùì
-Cannabis has been getting heavily shorted for quite some time because of legalization, shorts have made it very difficult for this life changing industry to flourish the way it should. 

-  ‚ùìIs cannabis industry over rated‚ùì
-No, cannabis stocks are overrated when they are 10b+ market cap before legalization and/or heavy revenues. Which is the case with some marijuana stocks. But $SNDL was well under 1b market cap, for a growing cannabis industry; this is highly undervalued. We are not saying $SNDL should be around the other popular mainstream cannabis stocks. But it should at least be higher 5b market cap.

- ‚ùìSndl is Canadian , legalisation is US‚ùì-
-Yes, you don‚Äôt think being able to expand nd distribute to US markets will help to grow?

- ‚ùìwhy was $Sndl preforming bad before‚ùì
-1Ô∏è‚É£They had bad managment, the new ceo Zach will turn it around you can see in pics above. 2Ô∏è‚É£Marijuana industry wasn‚Äôt as recognized before. 3Ô∏è‚É£ They were faced with huge set backs, if you look at one of the articles below. They had 2 fires which resulted in huge loss of products, floods, humidity control issues, and leaks. Yet they managed to stay debt free‚ùóÔ∏è. This was all not in their hands and due to having a shit location and poor building management/control.4Ô∏è‚É£As I mentioned they had setbacks, major one was poor warehouse control and management which resulted in humidity issues that further caused mold in the warehouse/cannabis. This has all been resolved and they implemented a new manager.

- ‚ùìcannabis industry has political issues‚ùì
-well for starter, the marijuana industry is no longer going to have those political issues with the Biden administration hopefully pushing it forward. Also, regarding SNDL the stock is highly undervalued compared to other weed stocks. Which doesn‚Äôt make sense because yea they‚Äôve had major setbacks but somehow they‚Äôre debt free. It‚Äôs a cannabis company that looks to be making smart business decisions plus the new ceo will make a positive change, we are not saying it‚Äôs the next canopy or are trying to promote it as the leading cannabis stock. But instead we are trying to show you a potential stock that can boom due to being undervalued. To add on, SNDL is heavily shorted which brings a possibility of a small squeeze. They have until June to keep their share price above $1 for 10days or it will get delisted. So far the price is heading in the right direction.

- ‚ùìregarding questions about 1b market cap nd if it can reach 5b:‚ùìOk looking at SNDL market cap it‚Äôs currently at 1.3b and the company wasn‚Äôt even doing that well before because of major set backs I mentioned above, so you don‚Äôt think after having a new ceo, and making smarter business moves; that it‚Äôs possible for it to reach a 5b market cap, almost all cannabis companies are average round or close to 5b market cap, and none of them seem to be generating any high revenue, because cannabis is still under full legalization. And if you‚Äôre wondering what smart business moves SNDL made, well for starter they are debt free‚ùóÔ∏èwhile many/all other marijuana stocks are still piled with debt. SNDL is debt free after going through two fires that caused massive losses and constantly burning through cash, like all other cannabis stocks. Look at this article here: https://www.google.com/s/www.fool.com/investing/2021/02/03/3-pot-stocks-to-avoid-like-the-plague-in-february/  you can see most cannabis stocks aren‚Äôt generating any revenue and there all burning through cash and filled with debt except SNDL has no more debt‚ùóÔ∏èand here in this article: https://www.google.com/s/www.nasdaq.com/articles/is-sundial-growers-planning-a-splashy-deal-2021-01-22%3 you can see how they are trying to possibly expand. so a $5b cap is quite realistic.

-  ‚ùìMany people keep asking about its market cap at 1b‚ùì Lol u say it‚Äôs over valued at 1b? What makes you say that, is it because their not generating any high revenue or their burning through cash. Yet, all other cannabis stocks are faced with the same issue and not to mention they are all piled with debt except SNDL‚ùóÔ∏èIf you‚Äôre basing your facts that it‚Äôs overvalued because of its revenue performance than you might as well say all cannabis stocks are overvalued because most if not all, are still burning through cash. And the top cannabis stocks you guys mention are Nowhere near a penny stock, which diminishes their entire purpose. The point of this post is to show a penny stock that can potentially boom due to being undervalued in comparison to others. Not trying to list the top leading cannabis stocks, which is what you guys keep mentioning.

- ‚ùìHow is $SNDL financials and revenue‚ùì

  - [This article here talks about how they raised 600million cash and all their debt obligations are gone ](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/once-down-weeds-cash-strapped-174412731.html)

  - [Here you can see their financials is bad and their revenue is not high but it‚Äôs because they‚Äôre trying to shift into retail from wholesale, also in the article you can see multiple cannabis stocks burning through cash and have similar revenues but only SNDL is debt free ](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/01/22/3-marijuana-stocks-that-could-fall-47-wall-street/)

  - [last article here you can see other cannabis stocks that burn through cash and have poor revenue but that the case with most if not all marijuana stocks as the industry is just beginning ](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.fool.com/amp/investing/2021/02/03/3-pot-stocks-to-avoid-like-the-plague-in-february/)

  - I listed these two articles to show you how many different cannabis stocks are burning through cash and piled with debt. $SNDL‚Äôs revenue isn‚Äôt high just like all those cannabis stocks except $SNDL has no more debt. Those articles don‚Äôt contradict my post I am telling you that SNDL doesn‚Äôt have high revenue but all those other cannabis stocks don‚Äôt have high revenue either but yet they have 5b+ market caps. So there revenue position is the same as $SNDL burning through cash and not generating high revenue  $SNDL is debt free and now has 600mill cash at hand. Do you understand the advantage??? In that article you can see aurora cannabis and cronos are burning through cash and have debt!!! Yet there market caps are higher than $SNDL even tho SNDL wiped its debt and has 600mill cash. Most if not all cannabis stocks are burning through cash and piled with debt, because legalization still taking place....


  - They raised 600mill in cash and wiped out ALL their debt obligations. ANY logical person can see how beneficial this is. They raised 600mill to re-invest back in to the business!! Looking into the long term there is endless possibilities for this company they can have many upcoming catalyst. They can use this money for expansion, buying out a competitor, or the introduction of a new product. Which $SNDL has talked about multiple acquisitions, mergers or overall expanding the company.


- ‚ùìregarding the questions about Canadian companies in the us market ‚ùì-Well for starter how do you know that once US goes through full legalization they won‚Äôt accept Canadian companies to flourish. There‚Äôs already major Canadian companies expanding in the us, and you don‚Äôt think SNDL is capable of doing an acquisition with a us company or let alone expanding their product/name to the us. Even if they partially succeed in expanding to the Us, they can still be major players in the Canadian cannabis industry you‚Äôre talking about a growing 37mill population with 99% cannabis enthusiasts. SNDL has lots of potential to grow. Search up this article (sundial growers splashy deal-nasdaq)

I am no financial advisor DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH. I can‚Äôt provide you with all the info or predictions on whether this stock will rise or sink. I am quite bullish on this stock based on my reasons, but there are multiple sources online that can further elaborate on where this stock is heading.

Alright listen up retards. NVDA is going to print at earnings. 

#Retard Analysis
Over the last three quarters, Nvidia EPS growth averaged 81%. They have earnings on the 24th, probably going to do well. CHRISTMAS could have some helpful effect as more people get into PC gaming. Especially with the shortage of PS5 and Xbox X that could have pushed some over the edge to switch. Regardless it would be a minor, but still positive impact. 

#Expanding Business 
Looking at Q3 2020 reports we can see some great news in expanding their business. Saw revenue and sales up 57%, a new record for them. 

* "Launched the NVIDIA¬Æ EGX Intelligent Edge Computing Platform to bring accelerated AI to retail, manufacturing, telecommunications, logistics and other industries, with Walmart, BMW, NTT East, Procter & Gamble and Samsung Electronics among early adopters". 
 
* USPS is going to use their AI tech to improve packaging process. 

* Loads of updates to software and companies adding RTX support showing they are becoming a standard in the industry. 

* The push forward on AI with self driving that is surely to increase going forward long term. 

* Their data center division revenue passed their gaming division and we all know data is the gold mine *PLTR autist PTSD*. Data center sales increased 162%.

#Red Hat
But the item im most interested in is the Red Hat collab they are starting. They are trying to get more involved with 5G telecom market by making virtualized 5G RAN networks using their GPUs. Retardedly put, they want to simplify how current telecom traffic works and make it more harmonized: to bring down maintenance and management costs; increase flexibility; allow multiple vendors to work on the same hardware and share resources. Further, Red Hat is going to become a major player in the cloud services industry. Azure and AWS just don't have the same capabilities as Red Hat's open source infrastructure and having a good relationship with NVDA looks great for future projects.   

#Semiconductor shortage easing
The world is coming off the end of a semiconductor shortage that was showing some recovery before COVID. Likely there will be no shortage going further into this year, maybe even early as Q2. Many of the car manufactures have been feeling the effects of the semi conductor shortage, even having to shut down factories temporarily before the situation improves. Bodes well for NVDA, supply is constricted and the pent up demand will blow its metaphorical load heavily at NVDA and other semis. 

#Bear case
The only hiccup: ARM merger deal is running into problems from anti-trust complaints by competitors. Likely to not happen when China reviews it and says no. The merger would make ARM US based and have the same US restrictions on exporting tech to Huawei or other blacklisted companies. Same thing happened with Qualcomm and N_X_P (automod removing small cap tickers) semiconductors. But on the off chance it does go through from both 1) The US taking a different stance towards China and 2) NVDA convincing regulators that ARM would still have impartiality for how it does business, the upside is massive. Not too concerned with it not happening since NVDA will adapt and move on. Its more of a bonus to NVDA and would only add to their underlying business that is already doing very good.


#What the big money is doing

Increased from 150 hedges funds with NVDA in their top 10 holdings to 218 in Q3 2020.

3% increase in institutional ownership from Q2 to Q3 2020

#TA for mentally ill
Has been largely stagnant since September, just now hitting new highs. Summarized crayons TA: Some major resistance at ~590 and just broke it and has been holding for the last 2 days. RSI is a little over bought, Id be guessing there is some sideways action for a couple days and then a run up and beat at earnings.

Bumble's business model is garbo tbh.

Having women message first on dating sites is suboptimal, and we know they will never initiate unless the dude is over an 8. Also, you only have a 24-hour time limit to even respond to messages. Which means there is a limited time to get a match or strike up a conversation. They also got into a huge settlement with their boost which was found to be misleading their customers. You can read more about the Bumble Settlement here: https://www.bumbleboostsettlement.com/

 Dating apps have high turnover and cause burnout fast. Also, consider that Tinder and other dating apps like POF and OKCupid have higher name recognition and more market share, and you'll see why Bumble's growth is capped. Don't bother buying high IMO. 

Just a quick DD on why I would be bearish tbh_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ [TSLA] Pelosi leaps playbook You may have all heard that Pelosi's husband bought [1m in tsla calls.](https://disclosures-clerk.house.gov/public_disc/ptr-pdfs/2021/20018011.pdf) last month.

Maybe some of you are getting sick of chasing after GME and APHA wrecked your asses and wanna play some real stocks IDK.

I believe that bets are best placed BEFORE the stock is at ATH, so I think this is a good time to post this while TSLA is going through some dips.

There is a lot to talk about when it comes to everyone's favorite CEO, but I think the biggest headwinds are these:

1. EV credits are coming
2. FSD beta currently being used by 1000 lucky(?) Tesla drivers.
3. The House Majority Leader Pelosi bought leaps. 
4. *censored topic here*

I don't wanna make this really long, so I just want to go over what exactly she bought.

25 contracts [$500 strike expiring at March 18, 2022](https://imgur.com/Nlw4PWZ) 

Note that she's actually down about 30k on these as of today. Are you mad about politicians insider trading? Well holy fuck you have a chance to get in at LESS than what she paid.

This is what her payout looks like: https://imgur.com/blP7gLZ

Basically she can't lose any money unless TSLA closes below $940 in by March 2022. However, you will notice that the leverage applied is only 1~2x. Basically this is like baby leverage vs holding shares.

I wanted to entertain some alternatives. So what if you got bigger balls and say TSLA doubles from here at the minimum? https://imgur.com/ZZGDYUN

You can see the upside is so much higher but tsla has to move a lot fast to outrun the theta burn.

So what if you thought about theta and want to spread it instead? (A spread is when you buy a call then sell a call further otm.) https://imgur.com/HoPgNl1

You probably noticed here that payout distribution gets bigger as you get close to expiration. Personally I think this is a better play than ITM calls, but of course, if TSLA pulls another 5x from here, nothing beats the uncapped upside of plain calls.

At the end of the day however, if TSLA just goes down 10% from here and doesn't come back for a year, all of these are expiring worthless. Btw kind of fucking crazy that if you have 100 TSLA shares you can collect almost guaranteed 60% a year. 

Did you buy GME because you hate the establishment and their privileged trading free money? Well, they're doing this one in broad daylight. Would you take it? 

Also not financial advice. Gamble your chrome money at your own risk.

(Not financial advice just my opinion) The stock is up over 500% in the past year and there are good reasons why. The market cap as of now is $3 billion so it still is relatively small and has a lot of room to run. I know some people might think it‚Äôs already up 500% where is the room to run... I get it but if PLUG can go from around $1 to $65 for gods sake CLNE can make a huge run too. CLNE revenue last quarter was $70.89 million up from the previous quarter of $59.87. They are not profitable yet but close to being profitable. The earnings per share last quarter was -0.01. Not bad. Previous quarter‚Äôs EPS was -0.02. Earnings is in March and it is expected for the earnings to be 0.01 per share. They have scored multiple contracts and recently a major one with L.A County Metro. For the LA County Metro they will be supplying 47.5 million gallons of renewable natural gas. Clean Energy Fuels scores a five-year contract to supply renewable natural gas for the nation's largest transit bus fleet. Also analysts are bullish on CLNE. Tuesday February 3rd Shares of Clean Energy Fuels¬†soared after the natural gas marketer and retailer received an initial rating of outperform with a price target of $17 from Credit Suisse. MarketBeat shows a consensus price target of $18.67. PLUG revenue was around $100 million last quarter and still not profitable. I think we will see profitability soon with CLNE.

Let‚Äôs see what‚Äôs to come in the near future._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ tendies alert: semiconductor shortage TL;DR: check out ON, TSM, TXN, ADI, MCHP, STM, NXPI

Hi y'all, if you are a nerd like I am, you should be aware that a lot of consumer electronics have been out of stock for months or having supply chain shortages (see: PS5, NVIDIA GPUs, AMD CPUs, phones, etc etc)

This is mostly attributable to COVID, but one of the sectors hit the hardest is semiconductor manufacturing. It has been dubbed the Chipocalypse: https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/10/whats-causing-the-chip-shortage-affecting-ps5-cars-and-more.html

the above is OLD NEWS (and you should know this unless you woke up from a coma yesterday)

NEW News just hit that Biden is going to do some EOs to alleviate this situation: 
https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-11/biden-team-pledges-aggressive-steps-to-address-chip-shortage

I think semiconductor foundries and chip makers are severely undervalued because of the current crisis, so I'm going in hard. I saw a DD about $ON having low IVs so I went in a few days ago, but I think with this news I'm gonna double down.

$ON 4/16 $45c_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ DD: Missed TSMC? My bull case for Shin-Etsu. Intro: Over the past few months, there have been an increasing number of posts discussing the semiconductor shortage in the automotive industry. The TLDR for these posts is that the big winner here is going to be TSMC. TSMC is the leading chip foundry in the world. It produces chips for Intel, AMD, Apple, and many others. 

My thesis: The chip shortage is already priced into the current value of TSMC. I still have 9 shares of TSM, but I am going long on those. This is a shorter term play based off of the ongoing automotive semiconductor shortage. TSMC sources it's wafers from 5 suppliers, 4 of which are publicly traded. These companies are F.K.S., MEMC, S.E.H., Siltronic, SUMCO. These 5 companies produce 85% of the worlds raw wafers. Shin-Etsu produces 33% of the worlds wafers. Shin-Etsu is also positioning itself to be one of the primary producers of the chips that are invloved in the automotive industry shortage. In addition, Shin-Etsu is one of TSMC's primary suppliers of Photoresist. Finally, Shin-Etsu is based in Taiwan, TSMC is fully aware of this and is taking full advantage of the logistics advantages associated with Shin-Etsu's geographical position. 
TLDR: I think that SHECY is going to see a rapids spike in the next 6 months.

Today I bring you an opportunity to make money once again. The $RBLX infinite money glitch. For those unaware Roblox is set to IPO soon. What does this mean? Unlimited money for your dick implants so you can finally satisfy your wife like her boyfriend does.

Step 1) Open position on Roblox after IPO

Step 2) Stock goes up, make money, and use money to purchase in-game currency in Roblox

Step 3) Absolutely steez out your Roblox avatar, while simultaneously increasing revenue for Roblox

Step 4) Roblox beats earnings estimates with increased guidance from new revenue and repeat steps 2-4 forever

EDIT: It is a direct listing, not an IPO, however that has no impact on the glitch. Direct listing just removes underwriting from the process.

Day Range: $208 - $221  
52 week low - $135  
Market Cap: $68bn

**At $68bn that gives DoorDash a larger market cap than the following companies:**

* Spotify ($SPOT)
* Palantir ($PLTR)
* Atlassian ($TEAM)
* Adidas ($ADDF)
* Workday ($WDAY)
* Autodesk ($ADSK)
* FedEx ($FDX)
* ....and $1 billion shy of having a larger market cap than Twilio ($TWLO)

**Lockup Expiration:**  
Looking at companies like Lemonade and Snowflake we can see that after an IPO and the employee stock lockup period ends, the markets tend to anticipate a pull back. For Doordash, this day is March 9th. There are some things that need to happen before the lockup is lifted however. DoorDash needs to be trading at 25% above IPO price for 5 days prior to this. The next one would be June 7, 2021.

With $DASH at the price it is today, hitting a high of $221, it's a safe bet to think that the lockup period will stand on March 9th. If the stock were to fall so drastically that the lockup period wouldn't go into effect....well you still win with puts because that means the stock fell \~$100 / share.

I have 25 puts for March 19, 2019 for a $170 strike. This cost me $21,817.50. I may add to this in the future, or buy more puts at a higher strike pending how the stock moves in the coming days / weeks.

I'm not a financial advisor, I live in the UK, I have a small position in the stock (which I am closing) and I build tools for stock analysis.

I've read and become familiar with datadog, including it's last four quarters worth of results and their coming predictions for the fourth quarter of 2020. The earnings report is coming out after close today.

If you're unsure about what datadog do - they are a monitoring and security platform for cloud applications.

The hit of the pandemic wasn't really an issue for them - sure, technology companies and cloud providers are tightening their belts, but when everything is moving towards home-working, there is a serious requirement for cloud monitoring and security when your business is becoming more de-centralized, a reality that creates more attack vectors for businesses.

This all points to good news for datadog, but they are still waiting for secure approval from federal level, which comes with quite the boost some cloud providers would be seeking.   

I have no doubt their revenue is probably about the level they predicted. A 5.3% increase from last quarter. The share price on the other hand has hit about 34% increase from the same time. The company is investing in rapid growth, with big spends in R&D. They're a great company and if you go long on this position then it will undoubtedly hit these numbers and above based on their GAAP, but at current I do not anticipate the earnings reports to shine anything that will justify this share price._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ So long as you think TLRY stock is worth $21 after the merger, APHA is worth a buy. Even if you bought APHA at $29 dollars yesterday, you're going to make $32 a share if the merger goes through at this price, so you might as well hold. The run up yesterday was too quick (remember this stock was at $18 on Monday as well) and I think now that there's been a correction we'll continue the steady runup that we've been seeing the past couple months. 

I've been in since $6 and have a cost average of around $12, so I could sell without taking a loss, but fact of the matter is nothing has fundamentally changed. Aphria is still one of the most profitable weed companies out there and they have control over everything from production to distribution in Canada (and soon America and the UK). 

Positions: 90 APHA shares (I'm poor as fuck)

This is not financial advice; please do your own due diligence and analysis before making any investment decisions._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Cloudflare earnings OVERNIGHT PLAY (Good 'ol fashioned DD) While most of you degenerates have been trying to time pump-and-dumps, there's been some serious gains going on in Cloudflare ($NET). They are up almost 20% over the last week. Cloudflare is a world-renowned cloud computing company that offers services from cyber-security to content-hosting. It IPO'd at the end of 2019, and is already up over 500% in the last 12 months. Cloud services are expanding at an extremely rapid rate, and it's one of the tech industries that has massively benefitted from Covid-19, considering the increase in demand for cloud computing resources due to people spending time at home all day.

Cloudflare Q4 earnings report is **tonight**. There has been some serious whale buy volume in anticipating the earnings jump \[[source](https://imgur.com/a/h7hMTO3)\]. Almost every stock with a heavy hand in cloud computing (esp Amazon, Google, Microsoft) have destroyed their Q4 earnings report. Cloudflare is the biggest CDN provider, and one of, if not the, biggest DDOS and bot protection provider. They have a massive hand in the market and serve millions of businesses, from small to ultra-large corporations. \[[source](https://enlyft.com/tech/products/cloudflare)\]

They have outperformed their anticipated earnings, and last report drew over any 11% uptick after the Q3 earnings statement. A solid earnings report tonight could draw an extremely strong uptick in price, and I'm betting on it. Positions: 2/12 $89 c, 2/12 $90, 6/16 c$110

TLDR: This literally can't go tits up, overnight calls are a one way ticket all the way to tendietown.

This is not real financial advice, I eat crayons, do your own DD to decide whether you want to buy a stock.

**Ticker:** $DIS

**Market Cap:** 341.8 Billion

**Assets:** 201.5 Billion

**Subsidiaries:** Disney +, Pixar, Hulu, ESPN, FX, ABC, etc

First, Disney is a safe as fuck investment. It‚Äôs a blue chip and should be a part of your portfolio. But fuck portfolios, this is a casino, so why will Disney moon? Why the fuck does Disney need a DD? Well, I'm Long $DIS, but today will also make for a good earnings play. 

**Disney Plus.** Have you heard about it? Well, millennials with kids sure have. As the millenials start pumping out babies after 12 months of social distancing, they‚Äôll quickly learn kids get bored easily, and fast. Disney Plus will be as big as Netflix in a few years, and will probably eclipse it for multiple reasons. They have a huge library that they own themselves, and the ability to have streaming premiers, etc. Not to mention the package with Hulu and ESPN. Netflix has a market cap of around **250 billion** with only **40 billion** in assets and 1.5 Debt-to-Equity vs Disney 0.7

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I‚Äôm long Netflix too, but clearly $DIS is the better deal here when you consider their other revenue streams. The fucking rocketship that Disney Plus is has only just started getting priced in, and is where Netflix was 6-7 years ago, but with an accelerated course to get there since people already adopted streaming. They also own their own content and have been producing since their inception, and have a better moat than Netflix. Even if the revenue from Disney+ doesn't match Netflix, they'll be able to pull a bigger profit and recycle old IP. 

Oh, let's not get into sports. ESPN, Cricket, etc. Mickey already has his dirty paws in everything. More independent services to charge for. 

Their earnings have taken a hit from their parks and experiences being limited from COVID. But the vaccine is rolling out, and their peak profit from this is in the Summer, where COVID transmissibility tends to be low, and partying tends to be high. This will have a much less effect on earnings than predicted the parks get busier this year with vaccinated people ready to go HAM from a year of isolation. Their parks are operating at 35% capacity, but they aren't at capacity for the bulk of the year. Even if the parks take a significant hit this year, it won‚Äôt even be noticed as $DIS tears through hyperspace. Fuck the moon. We‚Äôre talking Star Wars^TM type intergalactic travel. üöÄ


**Revenue Streams**

Media Networks: 28.4 Billion

Parks/Experiences: 16.5 Billion

Studio Entertainment: 9.64 Billion

Other: 17 Billion

**Earnings Play**

As for an earnings play, they report today. This is a casino. They‚Äôre still holding low considering the uncertainty with their parks, but park travel is low in the winter, and should have a low effect on earnings. But while kids were home, not in school, and causing a ruckus, Disney + subs increased dramatically over the Fall. Look at [Google Trends](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&q=disney%20plus) and notice the clear increase over Q4, probably fueled by the Mandalorian and the holiday classics people go nuts for.

You goddamn fool!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Why a long-term short squeeze isn't possible Thinking about all the craziness with GameStop stock over the past month made me think about how this is a great example of a real life game theory with the prisoner's dilemma.

So what is the prisoner‚Äôs dilemma?

‚ÄúThe prisoner's dilemma is a paradox in decision analysis in which two individuals acting in their own self-interests do not produce the optimal outcome. The typical prisoner's dilemma is set up in such a way that both parties choose to protect themselves at the expense of the other participant. As a result, both participants find themselves in a worse state than if they had cooperated with each other in the decision-making process. The prisoner's dilemma is one of the most well-known concepts in modern game theory.‚Äù (Investopedia)

Applying the prisoner‚Äôs dilemma to what happened with GameStop is relatively simple. The best-case scenario (based on the stated goal) is for everyone to work together and ‚Äúhold the line‚Äù. This keeps the price of GameStop high and forces the hedge fund managers to lose money covering their shorts. On the other hand, the worst-case scenario is if no one buys or everyone sells their positions in a short period of time. This resorts in the shorts still being profitable for the hedge funds and ultimately the little guy has no impact on the market. Now what really happens, and what did, is that tons of people bought and held in the beginning, which is what shot the stock price to the moon. Now after about two weeks people started to bail, which represents the other two scenarios in the prisoner‚Äôs dilemma. Where half of the party rats out the other half. With GameStop this is represented by some people starting to sell. The early sellers make most or all the profits leaving those who hold long term with a mostly worthless stock._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Paperhands strike again _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ PANDEMIC PLAY! So I‚Äôve been watching $CLX for some time now.. and Iv finally entered a position yesterday. 
We‚Äôre still in the middle of this whole COVID thing and Lysol and other cleaning products have been going FAST at local super markets. $CLX is currently at a 10 month low for whatever reason after beating earnings.. It‚Äôs low volume and low IV. 
I personally went in on some 4/16 220C that are currently trading for .80! If this thing returns back to 210-220 range, those calls will easily quadruple. Clorox had a 52 week high at almost $240!

Here‚Äôs a statement from the recent earnings call! 

It was said:

On an organic basis, Q2 sales grew 26%. I will now go through our results by segment. In our Health and Wellness segment, Q2 sales were up 42%, reflecting double digits increases in 2 of 3 businesses. Our Cleaning business had double-digit sales growth behind strong ongoing demand across our portfolio. Consumption remains high and, importantly, we're continuing to see increases in household penetration and repeat rates among existing and new users, driven by new routines developed from the prolonged pandemic as well as strategic brand investments.

I think it has a lot of upside potential!

The SEC has been active in the "popular rebellion" trading inspired by Robinhood among other sites. This appears to be the only relevant petition for comments. This is unfortunate. Some argue that these traders represent individual investors. This is clearly untrue. Individual investors these days invest primarily through mutual funds (e.g., Vanguard's $7billion holdings) and are strongly negatively affected by the stock market declines attributed largely to increasing volatility driven by the "popular rebellion" traders. A proper regard for individual investors would greatly restrict the market manipulation caused by ganging up on selected companies' shares.

Understanding The Market Requires You To Understand Market Psychology

Check out my profile for stock Analysis by request.

Stock market intraday patterns ‚Äì all times are in Eastern Standard Time!

When day trading the US stock market you may notice certain patterns, based on the time of day, that occur more often than not. These patterns, or tendencies, happen often enough for professional day traders to base their trading around them.

9:30am: The stock market opens, and there is an initial push in one direction. Highly volatile!

9:45am: The initial push often sees a significant reversal or pullback. This is often just a short-term shift, and then the original trending direction re-asserts itself.

10:00am: If the trend that began at 9:30am is still happening, it will often be challenged around this time. This tends to be another time where there is a significant reversal or pullback.

11:15am-11:30am: The market is heading into lunch hour, and London is getting ready to close. This is when volatility will typically die out for a few hours, but often the daily high or low will be tested around this time. European traders will usually close out positions or accumulate a position before they finish for the day. Whether the highs or lows are tested or not, the markets tend to ‚Äòdrift‚Äô for the next hour or more.

11:45am-1:30pm: This is lunch time in New York, plus a bit of a time buffer. Usually, this is the quietest time of the day, and often, day traders like to avoid it.

1:30pm-2:00pm: If the lunch hour was calm, then expect a breakout of the range established during lunch hour. Often, the market will try to move in the direction it was trading in before the lunch hour doldrums set in.

2:00pm-2:45pm: The close is getting closer, and many traders are trading with the trend thinking it will continue into close. That may happen, but expect some sharp reversals around this time, because on the flip side, man traders are quicker to take profits or move their trailing stop losses closer to the current price.

\---

3:00pm-3:30pm: These are big ‚ÄúShake-out‚Äù points, in that they will force many traders out of their positions. If a reversal of the prior trend occurs around this time, then the price is likely to move very strongly in the opposite direction. Even if the prior trend does sustain itself through these periods, expect some quick and sizable counter-trend moves.

As a day trader, its best to be nimble and not get tied into one position or direction. Many traders only trade the first hour and the last hour of every day, as these times are the most volatile.

3:30pm-4:00pm: The market closes at 4pm. After that, the liquidity dries up in nearly all stocks and ETFs, except for the very active ones. It‚Äôs common to close all positions a minute or more before the closing bell, unless you have orders placed to close your position on a closing auction or ‚Äúcross‚Äù.

Trade Entry Checklist - Things to Consider before entering a trade

1. Portfolio fit ‚Äì Make sure you diversify your portfolio. If you have 9 open bullish positions, consider a bearish stance elsewhere to balance your portfolio and reduce risk.
2. Liquidity Check ‚Äì If the stock you are considering has enough stocks traded per day. This can easily be found on Yahoo! Finance ‚Äì look for ‚ÄúAverage Volume.‚Äù Look for contract strikes that have at least 1,000 contracts of open interest ‚Äì this minimizes bid/ask spread and ensures market liquidity so that you can actually enter/exit trades easily.
3. IV Percentile ‚Äì Example: AAPL has IV of 45%, but IV percentile of 85%. This means that 85% of the time over the last year, volatility will be lower than it is right now as it‚Äôs current actual IV (45%). Likewise, if GOOG has an IV of 45% but an IV rank of 25%, then only 25% of the time over the last year IV was lower than it‚Äôs current value (45%). This means we have a 75% chance that IV will increase on average, meaning it‚Äôs current volatility is low ‚Äì and we want to buy into that. If IV is between 70%-100% you will need to actively monitor that trade, higher risk.
4. Options strategy - Pretty straight forward- If IV is high and the price of the underlying is also high, we can eliminate bullish strategies and focus on bearish, and vice versa.
5. Strike Price ‚Äì First you need to determine if you want an in the money (ITM) or out of the money (OTM). An ITM option has a greater sensitivity ‚Äì delta ‚Äì to the price of the underlying stock. So if the stock price increases by a given amount, the ITM call would gain more than an ATM or OTM call. This also means it would decline more than others if the price falls. ITM calls are more expensive as well ‚Äì higher intrinsic value.

Next consideration is risk/reward. An ITM option carrier less risk, but costs more. If you only want to stake a small amount of capital in a trade, an OTM position may be your best choice. OTM positions are riskier, cheaper, and potentially much more profitable if the stock surges past your strike price.

6. Expiration ‚Äì Date similarly to strike price, the further out a contracts expiration is, the higher the premium because time is on your side. There is a higher chance of the stock meeting your OTM target price given a year to do so, compared to a week. This is called Theta ‚Äì a quantification of how much value is lost due to the passing of time. Theta also grows exponentially as you near the expiration date ‚Äì your $190 strike call will be worth very little if the call expires tomorrow and the stock is at $180 because the probability of the stock reaching $190 is low.

7. Position size ‚Äì This is important ‚Äì BIG TRADING POSITIONS WILL EXPONENTIALLY INCREASE YOUR RISK OF BLOWING UP YOUR ACCOUNT. We suggest you place trades utilizing only 1-5% of your total account value, with an emphasis on the lower end. Play it safe, round down. It‚Äôs much easier to recover from a -5% loss than -80%.

8. Future moves ‚Äì Think beyond what‚Äôs going on with a stock than just in the current day ‚Äì unless youre scalping. Is there an earnings report coming up? Can I roll this into the next month if I need to? Is there an upcoming dividend payout? Take the time to plan your positions and don‚Äôt rush your entry ‚Äì You want to ensure the best possibility of success. I‚Äôd take $500 profit with a 90% success rate over $750 profit with a 50% success rate any day. You want to build consistency, and plan your positions before you take them._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ The case for H&R Block (HRB) At the time of this writing, HRB is trading at $19.46. I am holding 100 shares @ $19.61, and preparing for a liftoff between now and April. Let me explain why.

H&R Block is one of the largest tax firms in the world. They specialize in assisting individuals and businesses with paying their taxes. Their target market is primarily young people (age 20-24) who aren‚Äôt familiar with paying their taxes. Sounds like a lot of you apes, right? ü¶ç 

Anyway, the US government is expecting to open the tax season on February 12th, which is tomorrow. Because of an unprecedented number of young traders entering the market this past year, capital gains taxes among H&R Block‚Äôs target market is expected to be extremely high. (AKA the 18 year olds on the subreddit who made $20,000 on GameStop and weed stocks.)

H&R Block has traded as high as $37 back in 2015, and I‚Äôm expecting it to top that in the next few weeks. Furthermore, it pays a dividend yield of 5.28%, so the boomers are also interested in it. In my view, we‚Äôre looking at a perfect storm for H&R Block, and the earnings from this tax season will likely be heftier than most people recognize. 

TL;DR : young people who made money trading stocks and don‚Äôt know how to pay taxes will go to H&R Block. Stonk goes up, everybody happy._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ The economy will collapse tomorrow Alright fellow retards listen up for some real DD. I bought the top of GME and AMC and sold for a loss. I bought the top for APHA and TLRY and sold for a loss. I bought TSLA calls last year and the stock tanked costing me my entire $10,000 that took me half a year to save up, gone in a day. I‚Äôve lost so much money this year already I‚Äôm considering changing my name to Melvin. I‚Äôm going to go all in on SPY tomorrow. RIP to your portfolios._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Stock Market 101: You're on your own Because this subreddit has turned into teaching Finance while babysitting, I'd like to make sure you guys understand something. There's no such thing as paper hands vs diamond hands. 

This isn't some kind of socialism or collective we vs them thing. "paper hands" are the people who sell for a profit and leave people bags. Now depending on the situation, they might not leave bags, and people with diamond hands make more money. Sometimes, paper hands are right. 

That is because... drum roll... it's all about supply and demand. This is especially true in options, because they are zero-sum. That means someone will come out a loser. This idea that if we all hOLd tHE LiNE then the stock will keep going up is simply untrue. This isn't your modern dodge-ball where everyone comes out with participation trophies. Someone will be left with the bag, and that will be you if you don't start being skeptical and selling the top.

There are people that FOMO'd into weed yesterday. This is the result of people thinking stonks only go up. 

Last note: Lots of you. I mean, lots of you entered into the stock market for the FIRST time due to GME. Your first impression is that all hyped stocks will go from $4 to $450. Not at all true. What happened with GME is a once in a decade play. Whether you argue it's alive or dead isn't the point. Stop speculating that every stock will be like GME and lock your damn profits!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Some (RAD) Rite Aid DD and Updates Hello WSB back with an update on my Rite Aid play.  Up 50% from when I entered my positions yesterday and held through the dip early.  I think we will continue to see upward movement through the end of the month after the earlier movement this week.  

I am posting this again today as people thought it may be too late yesterday, but today is a great time to get in.


**RITE AID (RAD)**

Okay I know, your app is showing you it was .50 a year ago and you‚Äôre saying fuck idk about this one, it looks like I missed it.  It‚Äôs okay though, robbingyouhood is just lying again.  The truth is that rite aid had a 1:20 **reverse stock split** artificially X 20 the price.

*WHAT DOES THIS MEAN*

It means we can assume two things, rite aid has only doubled in price since its mediocre deal with Walgreens fell through.  

In 2016 Rite Aid had 4561 stores with a stock price of 160~ (adjusted for split) and a market cap of 8 billion dollars.  

In 2020 Rite Aid has 2500 stores with a stock price of 25~ and a market cap of 1.5 billion.

Yet if we look here https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/RAD/rite-aid/revenue

Rite aid revenue has actually INCREASED over the past five years and is at 75% of its highest point.  


They have trimmed the fat and beat earnings the last three quarters.


MORE PROMISING NUMBERS

https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/RAD/financials/annual/balance-sheet

Rite aid has a pretty optimistic balance sheet for a company that has been rebranding and restructuring.  Notably we can see they are sitting on 6 Billion in assets and are seeing 21 Billion Revenue with 12% growth this past quarter (over 25% this year)

Rite aid is becoming closer and closer to becoming consistently profitable once again as they are able to take advantage of coronavirus tax relief.  They are seeing increased foot traffic in their pharmacy and front end leading to this huge growth.  

Walgreens has 30x the market cap and 4x the revenue while CVS has 70x the market cap and 10x the revenue.  Neither are seeing the growth that rite aid is.  


**WHAT DO I DO**

I am very bullish on rite aid.  I am still holding shares and have adjusted my calls to 3-19 $30 and 4-16 $35 a handful of 2022 40$ as well.  

I have a price target or 50$ which I think is attainable by April. 

**UPDATED INFO**

The biggest criticism I see of rite aid are its debt and the fact it is a drug store.  

As for the debt, I believe this is already priced in.  Even with the 3.5 billion in debt Rite aid is STILL UNDERVALUED BY A BILLION DOLLARS. 

As for rite aid being a drug store, they have recently partnered not only with HEB grocery but they also launched their telehealth to generate additional revenue. 


Tl;DR: Rite aid was shorted to shit and saved itself with a 1:20 reverse split.  As a result it‚Äôs STILL fundamentally undervalued.  

4-16 35$ C
3-19 30$ C_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ BB/AMZN Speculation: Blackberry IVY for the automotive industry is just a cover. We are thinking too small. 175 million cars currently runs on BlackBerry QNX blah blah yada yada we‚Äôve all read a hundred DDs on why BB is going to dominate the EV software market and IVY is gonna collect harvest boatloads of data which BB can sell for a pretty penny. 

But think about it. 

Like, wrinkly-brain think about it.

Amazon doesn‚Äôt build cars or sell car insurance so what the hell do they really want out of this Blackberry partnership?

The answer is drones. Lots of drones. Our cities will be swarming with delivery drones in the near future, and Amazon needs a way to:

1. Control a vast network of drones that can delivery 2+ billion parcels per year 

2. Prevent them from running into other drones/evtols/planes/vehicles 

3. Prevent them from being hijacked by hackers and demonstrate to the government that their millions of drones are safe and secure (Blackberry has highest security rating)

4. Collect live data from the drones for package tracking, delivery times estimation , route optimization etc (IVY)

Andy Jassy, the current CEO of Amazon Web Services, will be taking over as CEO of Amazon in Q3. The same Andy Jassy from this article about BlackBerry IVY:

‚ÄúAWS and BlackBerry are making it possible for any automaker to continuously reinvent the customer experience and transform vehicles from fixed pieces of technology into systems that can grow and adapt with a user‚Äôs needs and preferences,‚Äù said Andy Jassy, CEO of Amazon Web Services, Inc. ‚ÄúThrough this joint effort with BlackBerry, we will provide automakers with the insights, capabilities, agility, and speed they need to thrive in an increasingly connected world. As automakers seek to race ahead in their digital transformations, BlackBerry IVY empowers them to build their brands and set the standard for connected vehicle services across the automotive industry.‚Äù

Blackberry IVY isn‚Äôt just some pet project for Amazon‚Äôs incoming CEO. It is quite possibly their MOST important project. Drone Delivery means that your Amazon Orders can get to you in MINUTES rather than days, and that they can come to YOU based on your GPS location instead of just your home or work address. 

Amazon‚Äôs plans for drone delivery is no secret, but always seemed like a far-flung future kinda thing. Until now. 

There must be a reason why Jassy of all people was chosen to take the helm at Amazon. What can he bring to Amazon that he isn‚Äôt already bringing from his current position as head of AWS?

Positions: jacked to the tits on BB shares. (Calls are too expensive due to meme status.)_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Last Week's Episode, On Wall Street Bets _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ The Snakes and the Wall the Fish Built - Path to the Moon Part 4 Once upon a time a bunch of Snakes decided a **Game** was **going to** have to **Stop**.

A clever deep sea fish convinced a bunch of **Retarded Fish** to **build a wall** to stop those pesky Snakes from stopping the game.

The **Snakes did not like this** one bit, they could not have walls being built without their permission, so **they did all they could to bring it down**. First they stopped the Fish from getting more bricks. Then they moved bricks between themselves which made the wall smaller. The Snakes were crafty motherfuckers and they had been **playing games with walls for a very long time.** This led to **an impasse** where the Retarded Fish would build up the Wall while the Snakes would tear it down. It looked like this could go on for a very long time.

Along came a Snail, a very clever Snail and in this reality the Retarded Fish listened to his idea. It was hard for them at first, being Retarded Fish but eventually they listened and **they took their own wall down** at his advice.

Suddenly a magical thing happened\*\*.\*\* The **Snakes thinking they had won** stopped moving stones between each other. They **had no wall to tear down.** They gave each other pats on their scaly backs. However the **Snakes** now **knew** that **the wall** the **fish** had tried to **build was popular**. They knew that the **fish might try again** to build the wall. The Snakes knew that if the fish should build the wall again it would be **better for them to make some prophets off of it**.

See the **Snakes had no interest** in the wall **the first time** it was being built, they had **an interest in taking it down**. Once the wall had been taken down and their losses recouped they had **no business in seeing the Game Stop completely**. Snakes like building walls even more than Retarded Fish.

**Now the Snakes had a vested interest in seeing the wall built**, as they could easily cover their positions from a low level, their was **nothing to stand in the way of the Retarded Fish.** Magically after following Snails advice, **the Snakes were now helping** the Retarded Fish build the Wall. The Retarded Fish went and got more Fish. Family Fish, Friend Fish. **Every Fish and Every Snake joined in** building this wall.

Each day **the Wall grew higher** and higher and very quickly it **reached the moon**. The Snakes were on the Moon, the Retarded Fish were on the Moon, all their Family and Friend Fish were on the Moon. **Everyone now had an interest in seeing the wall built. There was nothing to take it down.** They all lived happily ever after Rich as Fuck on the Moon.

&#x200B;

This is not financial advice, nor is it a true story. Unfortunately Retarded Fish are **too stupid to know good advice when they see it**. Too close they are to read the writing on the wall. It says "stand back, stop holding and **do what ever the fucking Snail tells you**." So simple it could have been to reach the moon but for the stubbornness of Retarded Fish.

I am joycey-mac-snail

My name is **LEONIDAS**

**I AM KING** 

**I AM YOUR WIFE'S BOYFRIEND**

When this is over you will beg me to take her from you. You are all **Kings and Queens in your own right**  but you don't act like it. You act like Retarded Fish.

&#x200B;

Edit: TLDR for you fucking retards. **NONE OF YOU SHOULD BE ANYWHERE NEAR THE STOCK MARKET IF YOU CAN'T READ A FUCKING CHILDRENS STORY.**

It's simple, bring the wall down and the Snakes will stop tearing it down. When you start building again, the Snakes will be helping you all to build it high.

High enough to reach the moon. 

Bring it down to Bring it Back Up. Easy. Money._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ ViacomCBS and the Future Long Term / Short Term Stock ViacomCBS - VIAC

Has been on a constant uphill trend for the past month.

Up 10.68% this week and 44.65% this month. 

ViacomCBS has its investor day on February 21st and just like Disney+ I expect them to increase share price exponentially. 

For those who don‚Äôt know ViacomCBS - VIAC is the stock for the new releasing streaming service Paramount+ (I know ‚ÄúAnOtHeR sTrEaMiNg SeRvIcE‚Äù, but this is different hear me out) 

Paramount+ will include mega Titans combing to create one of the top streaming services in the world. 

Viacom includes - Nickelodeon, MTV, VH1, ‚≠êÔ∏èBET, C M T, Comedy Central, and Paramount Network.

CBS has - CBS All-Access, Showtime, and live Sports & News. (CBS sponsored the super bowl this year, it also host the PGA WorldTour, March madness, and the biggest college football games out of the SEC)

On top of that Pluto Tv has also joined them. Pluto TV Provides television to lower income house holds and is free television that makes its revenue off of ads.

Paramount Pictures has a huge collage of movies and they also own 49% of Miramax which adds hundreds and even up to thousands of other options. These movies are timeless from Transformers, The Godfather, Wolf of Wallstreet, Mission Impossible, Star Trek, etc. 

On top of that Paramount was a huge part of creating Netflix and Hulu originals we all love. (13 Reasons Why, Tom Clancy‚Äôs Jack Ryan, Defending Jacob)

The stock has only been moving up the past couple months and after their investor day I expect them to make a killing and finally place themselves up there with Netflix and Disney+

Investor day - February 21st

Earnings - February 24th 

Paramount+ streaming release date - March 4th

This streaming outlet is in a whole different position then all the rest. It‚Äôs live TV / Sports mixed in with timeless TV shows and movies. I personally believe if they live up to their word this could be revolutionary and also could put the Nail in the coffin for Cable TV.

JUST WAIT

Once these companies get uplisting onto the NASDAQ , and become available on Robinhood, a lot of people will begin to realize the staggering revenue difference between US operators and Canadian ones that already exists. As we seem to be trending toward legalization in the US, time is slowly running out to get in but it‚Äôs far from too late.

There will be a pullback in the sector as a whole soon as the hype dies down again which will make the opportunity even JUICIER.

My favorites are the etf MSOS (only thing available on Robinhood that gives users a portion of US companies), which holds operators like TCNNF, GTBIF (first public offering was just bought by blackrock for $100 million), CURLF, and GRAMF (a Jay-Z and Rihanna backed company that off the star power alone may have a ton of room to grow)

Be careful out there! And know that this opportunity is only scratching the surfaceüòâ_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ The GME Fever, and How Your Money Can Be Better Utilized Nobody is going to call you an idiot for holding Gamestop from $5 throughout this insane run up, thinking it will go higher. Because it did and no doubt there was a great bit of excitement. 

But if you look at what's going on this week as far as volume goes, it has gone down. It seems like the stock is going to move much more slowly with a lot less investors with interest. Lots of big players exited their positions already and probably aren't looking to buy back in anytime soon. 

Those who are holding see a short squeeze as on the horizon. They see dollar signs. But how realistic is that really? We keep getting information that the next report is around the corner and the shorts will be revealed as being in a bad position. 

It hasn't happened. It may not happen. And many of you are slowly losing interest. 

This subreddit is called WallStreetBets for a reason. We make bets. Very rarely does the great group hold shares for a long period of time. Those of you who have Gamestop options expiring soon probably are sweating. And you should be. 

The point I have to make is, anyone still in Gamestop, why? You could be making so much more money elsewhere. Those who saw the signs and moved to weed stocks made a bundle. Now, granted most were in before the latest weed run up, but the momentum traders among you still made a good bit of coin. Obviously the weed craze won't last forever, but if you momentum trade like the majority of the group here, you'd be in and out with profit. 

The long and short of it is, your money could be better spent elsewhere, even if elsewhere is on YOLOs for options that are far OTM. 

The original theory on Gamestop may have been moving in the right direction, but where are we now? We're at a stock that's pretty low volume, trading pretty flat, or downward depending on your perspective, on the way to a sub billion dollar market cap. 

I think all of our money can be better spent somewhere else. On options. Far OTM. Expiring at the end of next week._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Stock Trading for Dummies 101 Take your profits and get the fuck out of these high volatility stocks. It‚Äôs fine to ride the train up, but please for the love of god, set a stop limit or a trailing stop. I‚Äôve been apart of this community for over a year but just started investing. I‚Äôm going to give the new people some advice.

1. Research the company and see if their valuation matches the current share price. 

2. Pay close attention to all the comments on whatever you‚Äôre investing in. It‚Äôs not hard to tell the real people from bots. Most bots will tell you to hold the fucking bag, while they run off with your money. 

3. If it‚Äôs too good to be true, it usually is. I‚Äôm not telling anyone how to spend there money, but please only invest in these high volatility stocks with the future of the share possibly tanking. 

4. Don‚Äôt let high volatility stocks take up a majority of your portfolio. I‚Äôve seen advice where people say one stock shouldn‚Äôt take up more than 10-20% of your portfolio. 

5. This one is a big one. If you see people hyping the fuck out of a certain stock, there is a good chance there will certainly be a sell off once people start seeing huge profits. It don‚Äôt hurt to take profit and buy in at a lower price. Definitely use risk management to make sure every trade is worth it. 

6. Don‚Äôt day trade, you will lose more money than you make in the long run. If you plan on investing short term, have a strategy. Invest in options that have good deltas and IV. These are certainly risky but if you like gambling on shitty shilled stocks, this one is for you. 

7. If you want to go long, invest in ETFs. Sure these will see lower gains, but over time the gains will be decent. If you want to go long on equities, make sure you love the damn stock. So many people see red and sell, this is fine if you‚Äôre using risk management and need to exit but horrible if you‚Äôre trying to make money without a lot of capital. 

8. Learn, Learn, and Learn. Learn from every mistake you make and better yourself for the next trade. I was a bag holder with GME, I lost about $600. Know which indicators lead to the stock moving in a certain directions. You think it will breakout, what will the catalyst be? Always strive to learn more than the previous day. 

TLDR: Trust your instincts, not random people on Reddit, who a majority are bots and shills. You can definitely learn from people on here, but you‚Äôre picking a needle from a haystack. You‚Äôre here to make money for your future, other people are wanting to fill their pockets, so expect misinformation. Take everything with a grain of salt._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ So with all this weed talk, is gme and amc dead? I know a bunch of people sold and got their hot dogs and we can do it again with the weed stocks but I'm curious if the whole gme trend is done. Gme and amc are pretty steady. I assume mostly because people are shifting focus to other stocks. I'm under the impression that the gme and amc spikes already occured and are unlikely to happen again given that a lot of people sold at the top. For those still holding gme and amc, is it more about principle now or do you really think they will spike back up? It seems strange that gme is so low and stable but there are also a ton of billboard posts about holding gme. Just curious why._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ DD- Valens is a MUCH better weed stock fundamentally than SunDial you retards. Highly undervalued. Epic growth, entering Australia, profitable, strong balance sheet, tons of cash VLNCF :  I asked people yesterday to explain why SunDial is the move given their horrific financials and performance. The answer was "we smoke weed and its a momentum play". Ok, but why not go with a company that has even more future growth ahead, already profitable, fortress balance sheet, cash out the ass, and great marketing ? When you make moves on an undervalued company, you get a huge margin of safety compared to being randomly retarded.

Valens is focused on oil based products and extraction. They do the extraction for all your fav companies including Tilray and Sundial. As those companies grow, they use Valens more for extraction. Valens benefits from everyone's rise as their premier oil extractor.

(Valens) (VLNS on TSX) VLNCF's revenue is 98M with market cap of 220M; OGI‚Äôs revenue is 80M with market cap of 1.3B; SNDL‚Äôs revenue is 97M with market cap of 4.4B. Thus, VLNCF‚Äôs SP should be between $10 and $35.

How does that make sense?

105 Million is short term assets vs 22 M in short term liabilities and only 30 mill in long term. Clearly got cash. In fact too much cash since investors were upset recently with the company raising more money. They believe it was unnecessary and the stock price dropped. I believe they did it to acquire a key partner. When this announcement hits, it will all make sense.

Valens. 88% yearly earnings growth according to 8 analysts. Current price 2.10$ cad, analysts target is 3.61. Recently fell down because they raised more money they didnt need.

Simply Wall St rates them 91% undervalued with a target price of 27.40$. That seems pretty excessive to me though. My target price is 6-10$, which would make it only a 1 billion $ market cap.

They are entering the Australian market which is ripe. Read about their plans in their presentation: [https://thevalenscompany.com/investors/](https://thevalenscompany.com/investors/)

Insider buying: Last 6 months, the ceo, directors and board of directors made 6 purchases, and 0 sales.

The stock price is currently at a low so you get a huge margin of safety since you are not buying hype, but are buying undervalued. If there were options on this baby I will get them right away. Since there is not, I got stock.

Summary

Rocket Companies (RKT) is a fintech company that operates several brands including the flagship Rocket Mortgage. I think RKT presents an opportunity to buy serious value at a cheap price, because the market has not priced in the underlying fact that RKT is a tech company akin to Square, Paypal, etc.

RKT has disrupted the lending industry and has embraced a fully digital ecosystem, which will continue to drive customer acquisition and retention in the future
RKT spends considerable money and resources on UX/UI development, client experience, and marketing. This will also help drive their continued expansion into the lending market.
The RKT ‚Äúecosystem‚Äù provides a ‚Äúfull cycle‚Äù solution for everything related to real estate transactions and insurance. They serve real estate professionals looking to generate leads, develop those leads, better serve their clients, and make every stage of real estate transactions smoother. From the client side, they similarly just make everything easier - it‚Äôs an app, it‚Äôs online, it‚Äôs doable from home and it‚Äôs not complicated. There‚Äôs an inherent advantage in what they‚Äôre doing here because closing on real estate transactions has always been something that‚Äôs complex, unpleasant, expensive, and not well understood. You need lawyers, you need agents, there‚Äôs a ton of paperwork, it sucks. RKT is changing all of that.
RKTs balance sheet, income, and liabilities support a stock price several times higher than the current one in my opinion.
RKT is currently stagnant in price, and the market appears to be pricing it like a traditional mortgage company, not a rapidly growing tech company (which they are).
RKT has been around for decades (skips the startup costs that will provide barrier to entry for newer companies looking to do what they‚Äôre doing), but somehow seems to still be leading the tech charge in the industry. That‚Äôs a unique and potent combination in my opinion.
RKT needs a catalyst to get the market to value it as a tech company instead of a lending company. Once that happens, and I expect it to sometime within the next year, RKT should approach an appropriate valuation such as 20x earnings. That‚Äôs an estimate I pulled out of nowhere, but is commensurate with the low end of P/E ratios for companies I see as similar to RKT.
Key Point - RKT is Priced Like a Legacy Mortgage Company

The average estimate for 2020 year end revenue is $15 billion, and the yearly earnings estimate average is $3.85 per share.

This estimate gives a ttm P/E ratio of just over 5.5. The sector median is something like 8-12, which makes RKT cheaply valued relative to the earnings it produces, even compared to the financial/mortgage sector. What‚Äôs key here is, I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs really an appropriate comparison. I would place them more in line with companies like Square (ttm P/E ratio of 325x lol), PayPal (ttm P/E ratio of 69x, nice), or Fiserv (ttm P/E ratio of 24x). I used Zacks for all of these P/E ratio lookups.

Let‚Äôs assume RKT is conservatively worth 15x earnings, and that it hits the estimate of $3.85 eps. That would put its fair value right now at $57.75 per share. I think it‚Äôs worth more than that but, we all should do well to remember that it‚Äôs really only worth whatever the market will pay for it.

Key Point - Catalysts

This thing needs a catalyst. Right now I am loading up. I‚Äôm buying shares, I‚Äôm selling SHORT TERM covered calls to reduce basis on those shares, but I will be stopping the sale of those covered calls within a couple weeks most likely. The Q4 earnings announcement will be on 2/25. I am not sure that the actual earnings numbers will be enough to wake this thing up, although I expect them to be good. But if that announcement comes with discussion of their focus for 2021 and beyond, and gets the market thinking about them as a tech company first and mortgage lending company second, things will start to heat up. I don‚Äôt know when the real catalyst will hit that triggers the run-up, but I think it could start with the Q4 earnings call. I am looking at $21 as the floor for this stock, and I expect the price to double within a year. I will be acquiring OTM LEAPs, expiring next spring.

Supporting information and background follows.

The Business

RKT is in the business of providing solutions to financial transactions, including mortgage origination and refinancing, auto lending, and more. Specific subsidiaries and my simplistic view of how they interact:

Home Financing

Rocket Mortgage - The mortgage company. This is a prominent ‚Äúpublic facing‚Äù part of the Rocket ecosystem.
Amrock - Amrock provides title insurance, property valuations, and other solutions. I see this as ‚Äúsupporting infrastructure‚Äù to keep clients within the rocket ecosystem where they would otherwise need to go elsewhere and is part of what makes RKT a one-stop-shop.
Amrock Title Insurance (ATI) Company - basically does underwriting for Amrock. The ‚Äúbusiness end‚Äù in my simple understanding of the world.
Nexsys - provides a streamlined approach to the closing process with their Clear Sign and Clear HOI technologies - taking care of closing day authentications and sharing of homeowners insurance information.
Lendesk - Lendesk specifically provides solutions for the mortgage market in Canada
Edison Financial - Basically the ‚Äúfront end‚Äù of Lendesk that Canadian clients would interact with.
Home Sale and Search

Rocket Homes - Rocket Homes is a proprietary home search platform and real estate agent referral network. Basically this matches buyers, sellers, and agents, and is a key aspect of keeping clients completely working within RKT for all aspects of real estate buying/selling/financing.
For Sale By Owner - A digital marketplace designed to let clients buy and sell real estate on their own. I think it‚Äôs absolutely brilliant that RKT owns this, but more on that later.
Auto & Personal Financing

Rocket Auto - Supports rental and online car purchasing platforms.
Rocket Loans - online personal loan solutions for clients.
Media

Core Digital Media - a major advertiser in the mortgage, financial, insurance, and education sectors.
Lower My Bills - this company is basically a ‚Äúportal‚Äù business model that connects people with providers of various loan and insurance products.
Services & Technology Development

Rock Connections - Basically a sales and support platform that handles appointments, prequalifications, generating leads, and data analysis among other things.
Rock Central - I will generalize this as ‚Äúbusiness support‚Äù. HR, administration, etc.
Rocket Innovation Studio - A tech incubator to gather and engage top talent and ideas.
Recent Acquisitions

RKT, through Lendesk, acquired Finmo back in October of 2020 (https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rocket-companies-subsidiary-acquires-fast-182042594.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAALnvnNBoglSnmMP0O61AqgXBJokNS53LjJYuG3NvYKhayp4I6ZH2RpfmFUbSsCAU4xmnBNGMTwiEG-Ly29EabVy1-OjPIGfkYoQ3389gn3Edebs9sIwWOy1tPzqjRwOwwGA_PWg0cNzEFCe7HBTilMwADUT_y0QxWw8vizWecGcv) Finmo is a rapidly growing Canadian digital mortgage platform and this acquisition I think was perfect - it shows RKTs dedication to embracing a fully digital experience, and making sure they‚Äôre the ones leading that charge.

Management

I do not have much to say here, aside from this. The RKT team is not the new kids on the block, they have decades of industry experience. Also, I value leaders that make people feel valued. And on that note, under CEO Jay Farner Quicken Loans has been in the top 30 of Fortune‚Äôs ‚Äú100 Best Companies to Work For‚Äù list for 17 consecutive years.

Financials and Growth

When it comes to the numbers, RKT is killing it. I don‚Äôt want to just spout a bunch of numbers that anyone can easily go look up so here‚Äôs a couple that stood out to me from the Q3 earnings announcement and related data:

$4.63 billion in revenue, which is 163% YoY growth.

From that revenue, they beat EPS estimates with $1.21 for the quarter vs $1.09 expected.

Net income was $2.4 billion which represents a YoY growth of 365%.

Closed loan volume YoY growth was 122% to $89B.

Net rate lock volume was $94.7 Billion (101% growth).

RKT has brought in $13.1 billion in revenue in the first 3 quarters and seems to be on track to close out Q4 with yearly revs above $15 billion.

That‚Äôs awesome but what I really like is that they pair this amazing growth with $3.5B cash on hand. That‚Äôs great because I want them to be able to scale as they grow, and make acquisitions as needed (see Finmo) to ensure they can keep that growth going without getting overextended and failing to capitalize.

RKTs ability to recapture clients is one of the keys to their future success in my uneducated opinion. Their recapture rate is 4.6x the industry average. The Q3 earnings transcript includes a statement by the CEO on how when interest rates fall, retention rate falls, refinance activity is larger. The high recapture rate RKT has serves as a natural hedge to their retention of existing clients because their recapture is so much higher than average in the industry.

Quick aside - RKT announced a $1 billion share buyback program. They‚Äôll be able to repurchase shares from time to time starting Nov10 2020, ending in two years. I don‚Äôt love the idea of share buybacks because I think this can be detrimental to actual business growth for the sake of shareholder value. However, with the large cash position RKT has (and it doubled from December 2019 to September 2020) I think this is a reasonable way to deploy some of that cash for now.

Ok so what about valuation using DCF, free cash flow analysis, something like that? Honestly I‚Äôm not convinced this is as useful as some people make it out to be. It‚Äôs nice to know what the numbers indicate, but I don‚Äôt spend a lot of time worrying about an exact price target based on anything like this. That said, you can crunch the numbers yourself or check out something like the Finbox resources:

https://finbox.com/NYSE:RKT/models/dcf-growth-exit-5yr

I don‚Äôt believe that fair value estimate for an instant, but it's a part of the puzzle to consider. Finbox has various models you can check out, but it‚Äôs also just a nice place to view aggregate data other than directly from the SEC filings.

Product Channels

RKTs direct-to-consumer channel is their main source of revenue right now, but I think they will be successful in their efforts to grow their partner channels as well. Why do I say that? Numbers don‚Äôt lie:

Direct-to-consumer Q3 growth: 131% YoY ($53.5B closed loan volume)
Partner Network growth 127% YoY ($29.6B closed volume)
Adjusted Revenue for Partner Network is up 502% YTD vs 2019 ( see Q3 earnings transcript)
The partner network volume is a little over half of the direct-to-consumer volume but the growth rate is just so damn juicy. That revenue growth is hellathicc.

Current Market and outlook

Right now, rates are low. The average 30-yr mortgage fixed rate is 2.92% (https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/03/mortgage-refinancing-surges-but-high-home-prices-stop-buyers.html)

I cannot say how long interest rates will remain low but I believe RKT is positioned to continue to grow regardless of what rates do moving forward. They just cover so much of the space, and they do it with a focus on applied technology.

Here‚Äôs some blatant speculation. I think as we move into 2021 and the vaccine becomes more prevalent, millennials will buy, sell, and borrow against real estate with renewed intensity. I think RKT is uniquely positioned to capture that market.

Any insight is appreciated, thanks in advance! 

TLDR; I really like this company and their stock but it‚Äôs also somewhat high; on a good trajectory though!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Which Cannabis Stocks? Relatively new to WSB thread so be gentle. I'm writing this to give everyone some research I've done on the pot industry. The purpose here is to educate and make smart decisions with your money. Whether that be long term growth or just pumping everything for the home run to the moon, you do you. Just make money folks.

We all know the cannabis industry is on the brink of legalization. There are so many companies out there. Some will survive and some won't. The overall goal is to deep dive into this to figure out which companies have an established footprint and the best chance to become the industry leaders (think of the AMZN or AAPL of the pot industry).

Anyway, here are some picks I've researched:

**$MJ - ETFMG Alternative Harvest ETF**If you're not interested in trying to pick big winners but want exposure to the industry, MJ is probably the number one most active fund that spreads their portfolio out all over. Top holdings can be found here: [https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/fund/mj/holdings](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/fund/mj/holdings)

**$PLNHF - Planet 13 Holdings Inc**  
Cannabis company based out of Nevada. For those who have been to Vegas, they have the largest dispensary in the world. Not only do they have an established footprint in retail, but they have the ability to expand and deploy and already successful business model with a $1.6B market cap.

**$CXXIF - C21 Investments**  
Competitor to Planet 13 Holdings in NV. Many Cannabis ETFs are continuing to purchase more shares since this is company is relatively undervalued compared to its peers. They have large amounts of free cash and recently brought in some high profile investment managers.

**$TLRY - Tilray**  
Canadian pharmaceutical and cannabis company that recently announced a $3.9B merger with Aphria ($APHA) to become the world's largest production and distribution company in the industry. They've also agreed to start exporting to the UK, giving them access to a much larger customer base.

**$TCNNF - Trulieve Cannabis Corp.**  
\*\*One of the top performing cannabis companies in the United States. They recently opened a third dispensary in Jacksonville, FL, bringing their total footprint to 73 locations in Florida. Similar to Planet 13, this company has most of their presence on the east coast.

**$CRON - Cronos Group**  
Cronos Group engages in the production and distribution of pot. I consider this one of the safest bets since it based by Altria, the tobacco giant that holds 45% of the company. They've posted consistent, solid earnings and continue to look into lab grown opportunities to reduce costs and become more efficient.

TL;DR - These are some of the most popular weed stocks that offer you idiots to expose yourselves to the legalization of marijuana. They have the best chance to continue massive growth as opposed to picking the next penny stock.

Edit: had to edit $C21 to correct ticker $CXXIF. This one is the only one that didn't have a massive pullback today._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ CANOO - GOEV YOLO _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Why $MOR is a high IQ play in 2021. BioTech, Cancer, Inflammatory Diseases. DD Inside. üöÄ **Disclaimer: This is not financial advice.**

**General:** 

During a pandemic both government spending and private investing lead to an increase in market value among the health and research sector. There are a lot of companies in those sectors that are worth investing in, but upon closer inspection, there‚Äôs a subcategory that looks even more promising: Biotech. This branch combines both health and research. You might have heard the names of the most well-known representatives like Biontech and Pfizer. Both are playing an important role in the distribution of vaccines. But even seen independently of the current pandemic, Biotech will probably gain an indispensable status with regard to yet incurable diseases like cancer, autoimmune or inflammatory diseases. 

**Introducing MorphoSys:**

Market Cap: 3.759B

MorphoSys is an important developer of biopharmaceutical drugs. The company focuses on cancer as well as inflammatory diseases. However, the company focuses not only on pharmaceutical research itself, but also on the development of intelligent solutions and infrastructure, a major advantage compared to f. e. Biontech, where the lack of those lead to a lot of critique and problems, in regards to the distribution of the vaccine. MorphoSys already has two approved products on the market and three proprietary antibodies. The company is broadly positioned with their technology platforms in the market and also licenses them out to academic institutions and biopharmaceutical companies for research. Therefore MorphoSys is a multi-talented company that is both a software and a research company. In addition, MorphoSys already has approved compounds that provide the company with a financial cushion.

**The numbers:**

MorphoSys was able to show revenues of EUR 48.2M in the first half of 2019. However, this multiplied to EUR 269.7M in the first half of 2020. (These figures are in euros, as I took them from MorphoSys's German balance sheets). Losses turned from EUR -28.5M in the first half of 2019 to profits of EUR 179.8M in the first half of 2020.

**Conclusion:**

MorphoSys is a heavily undervalued company right now. The approaches the company is taking are similar to those of its chinese counterpart Wuxi Biologics. MorphoSys owns software that combines research and development while contracting it out to others. In doing so, the company is one of very few others that is working on autoimmune/inflammatory diseases in addition to cancer, effectively covering a gap in the market and creating a unique selling point.

But the *week* WSB starts to really invest in it, there's a [news article](https://www.reuters.com/article/canada-stocks/canada-stocks-tsx-drops-at-open-as-cannabis-stocks-fall-idUSL4N2KH2HM) released and suddenly a huge number of the stocks crater.

Is there going to be a short-sell every time we might cause a rally? If that's the truth, then what's the point? Will WSB just become a new canary in the coal mine, used by brokerage houses to show when a sector or security on the rise and ripe for undermining?

I had a good amount of money in MSOS early on. Made some money, and then it went flat for a little while. Pulled it out for some day trading and got caught up and forgot to put it back in. Next thing I know this, and another stock I had recently pulled out of were going to the freaking moon.

I was going to ask if it's too late to jump in. I know these are long plays so the answer is no... but I wanted to know if y'all thought I should wait for a dip. Like this morning!? Everything is down and APHA 24% down as of posting.

So jump in, or are there some promising cannabis plays that are currently being overlooked? Do y'all prefer multiple individual stocks of your choosing, or ETFs?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Am I doing this right? First gain porn post. _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ GME was a game. Weed is an artificially inflated bubble. There is a much better opportunity to make money and help society at the same time. I am an economist and a psychologist, I've been on reddit forever, and I've always been a market index etf/hold type of investor (optimal balance of risk/reward) so I had no use for subreddits like r/wallstreetbets in the past.

With all the noise bubbling up about GME, I was curious to see what's up.   My take on what's going on:

GME:  Let's get real.  It's a doomed brick and mortar game company.  Boosting it was fun, but it's ultimately artificial and we all know we're unlikely to hand more and more of our personal dollars over to Gamestop in the coming years even if they come up with some kind of competent online strategy (it's laughable we're still waiting on that this late in the game).  Sorry if you're holding the bag, but there's no point.  The company doesn't have legs.

Weed: This is a legitimate industry with very predictable, steady long term growth as more markets come online with easing laws and regs.   It's not going to grow much more in existing markets.  Weed is just weed.   You can only consume so much, and it's easy to get sick of it.   It has some limited medical uses, but it's not about to surprise us.   IOW, the long term growth potential is all priced in.   Boosting it was fun, but ultimately pointless, WSB has generated another bubble.  Don't get caught holding the bag here either.

Psychedelics:   Ok this is a real opportunity.   The research on psychedelics is astounding.  It's effective in novel ways, providing profound relief from otherwise intractable conditions like major depressive disorder, and used in conjuction with therapy, is effective for helping people cope with PTSD, anxiety, and potentially many other emotional issues.   Unlike other medicines used to treat these conditions, it appears possible to deliver psychelic therapies with very minimal side effects.   As a psychologist, I am incredibly hopeful about the potential benefits it can bring with proper research and social acceptance.  As an economist, I see a world changing development that doesn't just boost the economy, but the well being of people as a whole.  Investing in pyschedics will actually help usher them into the mainstream, opening up more research opportunities and pushing back on the long-standing conservative stranglehold preventing us from discovering more about the potential for these drugs.  

In other words, it's good for a short term investment, it's great for long term investment, and it's a much more prosocial investment than say, tryiing to "stick it to the big guys."  I recommend the ETF PSYK, and the company MMEDF Mind Medicine (MindMed) Inc.   Both are great entry points.

I'm not one for surprises so I put it right up there in the title as a big FU to all those betting against AMC right now.

I'd like to make something abundantly clear. AMC is is not going anywhere. Not only will they weather this storm and come out on top but there are companies like Sony and Columbia that are *banking on* the existence of a Box Office to recoup their investments in silver screen flix. I guarantee that right now there is Peter Venkman merchandise already sitting in warehouses waiting to hit the market (and likely gamestop stores, lol).

Now I'm not goig to sit here and do your research about Thanksgiving release date movies and Christmas etc... but you can bet that the entire movie industry is looking for COVID to be over just as much as the travel industry who's buying up island destination properties.

For everyone and anyone who's negative with AMC I'm wondering why on earth they'd take a loss versus waiting till the summer when this stock will easily exceed $20/share (IMHO of course). I see no reason to concede shares back to those who shorted them simply on principle.

If you'd like to do your own research about AMCs financials I suggest posts like [this one][https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lctc6u/i_cant_believe_how_many_people_are_more_retarted/]. While I can seem to find it, someone here had stats on what AMC makes off of MoviePass alone. Let's not let the media con us here.

**What the Sell-side is Missing**

You know what the beauty of a pre revenue and a highly disruptive company is? The opportunities are endless and only limited by lack of imagination. Think TSLA early days. 

Yesterday, UBS downgraded SPCE because of its "stratospheric stock move", claiming  valuation "appears full following a 100%+ gain since the start of the year", while also upping valuation from $35/share to $52/share (aka we are at fair value according to the UBS). We have three things to say to UBS:

1) Virgin Galactic, along with Blue Origin and SpaceX, are the top players in an emerging industry, that has the potential to change the way we travel, communicate and harvest resources. 

2) The general investing public has limited understanding that they can invest in space via SPCE; and 

3) You don't hop off of the tendies train before getting to the station

Below we present our DCF showing how we could theoretically make the case for SPCE $2000. These are aggressive forecasts and Virgin Galactic would need flawless execution from here on out, but the possibilities are basically endless. Who knows what will happen in 10 years....UBS sure doesn't.

[Source: We = Me and your dad; not investment advice, do your own dd](https://preview.redd.it/pai22wzt6qg61.png?width=1081&format=png&auto=webp&s=0e415773466aa75aed75a19cc6fea7680fc88355)

Here are some revenue drivers that are likely unaccounted for in sell-side models. Ordered from insane to most insane.

**Sub-orbital Pricing**

We expect sub-orbital ticket pricing to be much higher than the sell-side is anticipating. As of right now, the list price for a ticket is $250k...and we expect the first 2000 unencumbered flights to cost $2Mn+. Our rationale stems from Virgin Galactic's "one small step" program application where individuals signing up for the waiting list were prompted with options to select their preferred price range. There was a $1Mn+ ticket option and the company inferred in the application that tickets would likely go for $1Mn+. 

[SS2 approaching Space](https://preview.redd.it/s659l5tz9qg61.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=2661e8ce927ead7d7cbe49484a72e93b3ba2d705)

**Hypersonic Travel**

This will be the most significant revenue driver in the near term if achieved. Hypersonic travel has the potential to upend the existing transatlantic/ultra-long-haul travel regime. We are talking Howard Hughes type stuff. LA to Tokyo in 2.5 hours....unreal. 

While management has remained tight lipped about its hypersonic program, we ultimately expect Virgin Galactic to acquire Boom Supersonic in a stock for stock deal at some point in the next year. We believe that this would speed up VG's go-to-market by three years, with service starting in 2025.

[VG Hypersonic mockup](https://preview.redd.it/3clhvjfrcqg61.png?width=768&format=png&auto=webp&s=b8e321766d6163ddb0eda6b001b7c971e6138c5d)

[Boom Hypersonic mockup](https://preview.redd.it/oq2l07cwcqg61.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=ac6caf58a1c803949b5e7c0d8959827348ff466b)

**Satellite Launch Biz**

While we recognize that Richard Branson's other space company, Virgin Orbit, plays in this space, we would not rule out Virgin Galactic expanding into this business as well. Keep in mind, Richard Branson is a minority shareholder of VG and VG has a fiduciary duty to all shareholders. If Virgin Galactic could adapt its current infrastructure to implement satellite launch capabilities, we would expect them to pursue this business.

Our thoughts stem from: 1) Virgin Galactic's recent petition to the DOT and FAA for more use cases for its mothership, White Knight Two; and 2) White Knight Two was originally a dual purpose aircraft for both sub-orbital human travel and satellite launches.

[WK2 launching satellites](https://preview.redd.it/6l93144uoqg61.png?width=760&format=png&auto=webp&s=0b073ee4447586fd23d2b22b69dfb3d1931d2ff8)

**Consumer Division**

The only thing more disruptive to the automotive industry regime than electric vehicles is....flying vehicles. While we believe that SpaceX/Tesla will pioneer the technology, we expect VG to be a top three player if they pursue this opportunity. Again, this is futuristic but possible, and a long time coming. We believe our current revenue forecasts are conservative IF they are able to develop this technology. Again we, and UBS, have no idea what the world will look like in 10 years....so it's possible. VG has the IP and knowledge to be among the first-movers in this space.

**Space Mining**

Screw it, why not? With the environmental conservation push enveloping the globe, we could see mining on earth completely outlawed if humanity is able to exploit asteroid/lunar mining.

**SETUP/TECHNICALS**

Today will be a key day technically. UBS attempted to stop the tendies train with their downgrade yesterday, which caused a slight breaking of trend support. Fear not, we have seen this pattern before and could possibly break the resistance that we have been battling for the last two weeks. We believe we are in the oversold/consolidation phase similar to what we saw last month. We additionally note that by 2pm today the 200 hour moving average will be at current levels adding additional support to the uptrend.

[Hourly SPCE chart](https://preview.redd.it/npz8ggkigug61.png?width=1175&format=png&auto=webp&s=e97bc8f40b4f8dbb7c4acbf88111ec5ee9c8071e)

And if we pull a similar move to last year's parabolic move on a percentage increase basis, we could see SPCE at $136 in the n/t.

[SPCE weekly chart](https://preview.redd.it/kzc7y3c2aug61.png?width=990&format=png&auto=webp&s=01fda9fd8a31c02b845208e5e3b89b5e06372b67)

Additionally, hype is building quickly. As shown below, the SPCE subreddit sub count is reaching new highs everyday, which we expect to go parabolic should VG have a successful launch over the next week. Keep in mind, the general investing public is still not aware that SPCE exists and we expect broad public equity support after a successful launch.

[Subs on SPCE subreddit ](https://preview.redd.it/j1te6lykxtg61.png?width=857&format=png&auto=webp&s=da8725eec85da44a039b5617f284482929d6accc)

Last but not least...the **short interest data**. Virgin Galactic is currently one of the most heavily shorted US stocks with S3 recently noting that there is over $2Bn betting against VG.  We estimate SPCE's public float (ex-Virgin Group/SoCap/Aabar) at 60 million shares (60mn shares\*50 price=$3Bn). We therefore believe that \~70% of the float is short. Additionally, the call option wall is stacked, and any major movement on a successful launch will likely create the mother of all gamma/short squeezes.

**Upcoming Events**

Feb 12-16 - Spacex SN10 launches..spce usually trades as a proxy

Feb 13-18 - Virgin Galactic launches SS2

Feb 25 - Earnings report; we expect update on pricing + potential Boom acquisition

March - SS2 flight 2 and FAA approval

April - Ark Funds launches space etf 

April/May - Richard Branson goes to space

July+ -  Leonardo DiCaprio, Katy Perry, Justin Bieber go to space. 

**Main Risks**

1) Rocketship breaks

2) the company continues to work at snail's pace

3) Increasing competition

**Conclusion**

As we note in the title, this is a WSB vs UBS story. When UBS downgraded SPCE yesterday, while simultaneously raising their price target to fair value, we shook our heads and asked how is this even possible? Does anyone really know what the world will look like in 10 years...let alone a space company? So in response, we are here to show them that we run our own models and have our own thoughts on Virgin Galactic. Let this be a message to the sell-side from WSB....while "you try to add value, we straight up create it" if you know, you know. Strap in ladies and gents, SPCE is about to go on a wild ride.

Before the market opening, PepsiCo reported a fourth-quarter profit of $1.47 per share, a penny better than estimates. Revenue rose 8.8% to $22.46 billion, also exceeding expectations. PepsiCo shares fell slightly in the premarket.

> * Uber shares dropped 4% in Thursday‚Äôs premarket, the morning after the company reported a smaller-than-expected loss of 54 cents per share in the fourth quarter. However, revenue fell 16% to a lower-than-expected $3.17 billion. Uber‚Äôs ride-hailing business slowly recovered, while its delivery business boomed.

> # 3. Cannabis stocks jump in a Reddit-fueled trade reminiscent of GameStop

> * Cannabis stocks were soaring as the Reddit crowd that spiked GameStop jumped in. Tilray shares surged nearly 51% on Wednesday, pushing the stock to a year-to-date gain of more than 670%. Not nearly as bet-against as GameStop, Tilray‚Äôs short interest was still equal to 22.5% of the shares available for trading, according to FactSet as of the end of January. Tilary added another 10% in Thursday‚Äôs premarket. Tilray is no stranger to a short-squeeze rally. The stock spiked more than 1,400% between July and September 2018, but those gains did not last.

> # 4. Dating app firm Bumble set to begin trading after pricing IPO

> * When 31-year-old Bumble CEO Whitney Wolfe Herd takes her dating app company public Thursday, she‚Äôll be noted not only for her youth but also as one of the few female founders to lead her firm to an IPO. Bumble, whose board comprises 73% women, priced its offering Wednesday evening at $43 per share, raising $2.2 billion and valuing Bumble at around $8 billion. The stock market response will act as a litmus test for companies founded by women, who account for just 7.4% of Fortune 500 CEOs. That‚Äôs an all-time high but still a staggeringly low.

#**DISCUSS!**

What's on everyone's radar for today's trading day ahead here at r/wallstreetbets?

*****

# **I hope you all have an excellent trading day ahead today on this Thursday, February 11th, 2021! :)**_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ 4:20 blazin‚Äô weed stock thread 2/11 Smoke weed everyday_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ GME 2/11 GME/Jim Cramer megathread_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ MVIS is the way retards (DD inside) üöÄüöÄüöÄ Yeah yeah, I know what you're thinking "but it's not weed! I can't light up LIDAR", and your right, you can't. But LIDAR is the key tech that will make automotive cars go vroom vroom, and MVIS has the best version of it.

Here's a little history on the company: üöÄüöÄüöÄ

Used to be part of of a university, then spun off into its own thing.

Traded pretty flat for a while as the team continued to work on their product.

They won the Microsoft Hololens 2 project and are an integral part of what make it work (makes VR go VRoom too) üöÄüöÄüöÄ

For the past 2 years they have been working on their state of the art Long range automotive LIDAR sensors with a planned full demonstration in April.

They released news yesterday AH that they are set to meet and exceed those specs üöÄüöÄüöÄ

In a nutshell, they appear to be a classic case of incredible tech that lacks good marketing and PR. If you look at a comparable company (LAZR), MVIS should have a valuation at least closer to 5B but more likely 10B, which means another 3x to move.

TL;DR MVIS has best tech üöÄüåïüöÄMVIS undervalued üöÄüåïüöÄ MVIS go to moon üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

----------------

Disclaimer, not investment advice, I own MVIS shares and calls

Positions: 1500 shares, 40 2/19 16c and 55 5/21 16c

Edit 1: I added 600 more shares on the dip to 18_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Alright Apes. I got a good one for you. Listen up. SENS SENS. Senseonics. 

Their product is better than everything on the market and extremely price competitive. they have a 90 say sensor implant for diabetes patients out now. Their competitors only have a 15 day sensor and costs like 3 times as much. health insurance covers the eversense sensor by senseonics. they have a 180 day sensor about to be approved by the fda and a 360 day sensor both of which are available in europe right now. Their competitors dexcom has a 38 billion market cap and right now SENS has a 1 billion market cap. SENS is currently trading at $3.80 and will hit $10 soon. It could easily 10x in the next year and take over the market. SENS to the moon üíé üëä ü¶ß üí™ together!

Here is some more DD from u/whodisdani 

Alright guys, sorry for the late reply I gave my very best as I do this one of the first times ... maybe I am approaching this wrongly or interpreting this wrongly.

reporting back from my research: first of all I am not an accountant / economics student (I am an software engineering student who had a little bit of accounting, gave my very best to analyse the stuff) maybe if someone could double check (will link the infos and datasources):

the company made -94 millions in the last year, hence quite a bit away of being break even. In 2020 in comparison to their previous years their revenue operating revenue fell over 50%. This seems to be a covid related issue. In the last two quarters of 2020 they had some income, however, still far from profitable.

‚Äã

I tried to break this down into this new 180 day device thing you mentioned, since I had no idea what this is, I went reading into this.

So I created the following calculation (I may be completely off, if so, say this pls): SENS reported that with their new alliance with Ascenia, they will be able to launch the product in Europe. With their operation revenues of 10'016'000 they have approximately 101'000 customers (based on a product price of 99.-). If they are able to expand again (as they did over the last few years) their operating revenue in the US would look something like this (I took the quarterly data, removed the huge spikes and this gave me something of a growth rate like this)

:

Q1 2021	Q2 2021	Q3 2021	Q4 2021
11'531'000	13'087'000	14'853'000	16'857'000
This would lead to an increase in market share of SENS from 0.3% to 0.5%.

Calculation market share SENS:

Country	Diabetes	Product cost	Operating revenue	Customers	Market share
USA 12.2020	30'000'000	99	10'016'000	101'000	0.3%
USA 12.2021	30'000'000	99	16'857'000	170'000	0.5%
‚Äã

I tried to consider the expansion into the European countries as well, with the same market share as in the US.

‚Äã

Country	Diabetes	Product cost	Operating revenue	Customers	Market share
Switzerland	500'000	99	250'000	2'500	0.5%
Germany	9'500'000	99	4'700'000	47'500	0.5%
Italy	3'300'000	99	1'630'000	16'500	0.5%
Netherland	1'300'000	99	640'000	6'500	0.5%
Poland	2'300'000	99	1'130'000	11'500	0.5%
Spain	3'600'000	99	1'780'000	18'000	0.5%
‚Äã

With this kind of growth, the operating revenue would nearly triple from this year to the end of next year. However, I have no idea if I have done stuff correctly, nor does this have any scientific value. As I said, I did not study anything related to stocks.

* Encourage newbies to periodically profit take. Also take profit yourself.

* Don‚Äôt blame the system if you buy the ATH and other people take profit.  

* You won‚Äôt time the top perfectly, try to aim within 10-20% of the top. 

* **Don‚Äôt get emotionally attached to the stock**. The stock doesn‚Äôt even know who you are. 

* If you buy in because a stock did the same thing 3 days in a row, don‚Äôt get mad if it doesn‚Äôt do the thing a 4th time.

* If you don‚Äôt have an exit strategy for your FOMO position, you are **guaranteed** to lose money. If you did not get in on the ground floor, your profitability window at the top is much tighter.

I was on clubhouse and someone mentioned $CME as a potentially big opportunity. I did some research and agree that this could be a big win. Here are my thoughts .  


The CME Group ($CME) is a U.S. based global market company whose subsidiaries include; Chicago Mercantile Exchange, Chicago Board of Trade, New York Mercantile Exchange, The Commodity Exchange, as well a 24.4% stake in the S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC.  


Yesterday the bears had a field day with $CME resulting in nearly a ten-point drop from the previous days high. The 3.5% drop put the price at $185.20 as of the markets close; this is despite a surprise increase in earnings and a marginal decrease in year over year.   


$CME is currently trading 40 points below its 225 high last February and has a market cap of $66B. However, the company's total assets exceed $117B ($35B more than the previous year) and shareholder equity is approximately 40% of the current market price at $26B.  


This alone is enough for me to believe that the stock is undervalued. By comparison, $AMZN's asset to market cap comes in at 13.55% and their shareholders equity is a mere 5.6%.  


This analysis is strictly quantitative and doesn't account for some very important qualitative aspects that could be cause the stock to rally. ¬†  


As many of you degenerates already know the CME group has created some exciting new futures and options that I cannot mention here but feel free to google it!  


Another important factor to consider is the massive $1.9T stimulus that is slated to make its way to the people over the coming weeks and months. As we have already seen from the previous covid stimulus payments - there will be a significant increase in retail investment more specifically an increase in options and futures trading and $CBE will probably be a major beneficiary due to it\&#039;s subsidiaries.  


In conclusion, I think this is a great opportunity for us . Time to add more diamonds to our hands bois. Let me know your thoughts and what the best play would be?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ ARCHER (eVTOL) will go public This market will blow up by 2025 as soon as the certification mobs (FAA and EASA) will change their requirements in order to have those vessels flying over our heads.

* In Europe **Lilium** is doing their own way up from Munich. **Volocopter** too, but in a different way, already flying in Asia for testing. None are public and I think they will not be in a short term.
* **Joby** has done over 1000 test flights and it is the most advanced in all this certification problem with the FAA. It has launched an office in Munich too.
* **Ehang** from China is doing their own way, no idea how they will deal with the FAA and EASA, but China is big enough to have their own business over there if they are not accepted in our countries.
* **Airbus** and **Boeing** are late for this change as old fashion automakers are for the electric cars. To big to change the direction of their businesses, although both of them have their own program. Airbus a bit more ahead than Boeing, although none of them achieved major milestones.

So the idea of having a public company within EEUU with a higher probability of being accepted in Europe is a great opportunity.

For sure, I will keep an eye on the IPO date. This might be the same trend as for electric cars, but for air mobility together with an Uber idea, as no pilots are needed.

Well I'm gonna shit post anyways. 
Like every responsible investor i only buy my stocks based off the meme on my phone while masturbating to pictures of my portfolio. 
I frequently screen shot my gains and send them out like a sexy thot I take out on the town. 
AND hide the ugly losses like a 3000 pound land whales i dp with my wife's boyfriend. 

I came to wall street bets after the people on the bizz board of 4chan made me post pics of my flaccid cock b4 they would give me advice on obscure cr

Cryptic currency. Unfortunately my healthy pencil sized little worm was flagged as cheese pizza, and the fbi came over and revised my donut üç© hole. 

I want only memes getting advice off long drawn out post in a byzantine rug store(WSB) is similar to asking the prostitute I get to rim my asshole how to find a great girl with Christian values. I was born after 2000 so I don't understand anything that isn't flashing across the screen with small captions and written entirely in emoji.

Hinestly i want a meme only filter that my smooth brain can use to validate my massive losses.

Call me a paper hand bitch but if we are trying to fuck those bastard hedge funds out of their STOLEN billions we need to act together. Cut your losses when you‚Äôre ahead and move on to the next stock. Without unity this sub is going no where and it‚Äôs exactly what the hedge funds want. Move on to the weed stocks and from there we will find something else to invest in. Stand together retards and we will all end up on the moon together.

SNDL to the moon!!!!!! üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ DLB and why it is undervalued for what it does What‚Äôs good fellow gamblers, degenerates, quaalude parachuters, and newbies.

It‚Äôs ya boy, ElJefe here and I am here to share with you how Dolby is an undervalued and often overlooked company that actually has more potential than meets the eye.

Dolby‚Äôs most recent earnings from their fiscal 1st quarter showed a strong YoY total revenue increase of 33.57% ($389.9 million, compared to $291.9 million). Where it gets interesting is that their cost of products and services decreased by 10.47%, their cost of revenue decreased by 5.39%, and this resulted in a 39.28% **increase** in their gross margin. They were also able to shave 7.8% off their operating expenses while increasing their operating income by **239%**. Their  Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share increased from 0.64 to 1.48.

**Dolby is thickly cash heavy.**

They make most of their money from licensing its audio technologies to broadcasters, television OEMs, computer manufacturers, gaming console companies, and cell phone makers. With royalty‚Äôs being 95% of their revenue, this is a strong business model that is able to create steady cash flow.

Their numbers are impressive and if you want to take a further look you can dive in here https://investor.dolby.com/news-releases/news-release-details/dolby-laboratories-reports-first-quarter-fiscal-2021-financial.

**Dolby Vision** and **Dolby Atmos** have been extremely popular and are used in Broadcast, Mobile, Consumer Electronics, PC, Cinema. Think of the amount of TV‚Äôs, smartphones, home stereos, etc that are being sold that use these two technologies. Consider the recent iPhone ‚Äúsuper cycle‚Äù as one example to put into perspective how many devices will be using Dolby‚Äôs technology. Also consider that the demand for premium home entertainment has increased due to people spending more time at home. One other thing is that there is a higher demand from e-commerce platforms for audience-engaging content, which is increasing sales of Dolby Vision. Then there are the movie theaters, once they reopen of course, which is going to even further increase cash flow.

Do you know a company that uses Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos a decent amount? Netflix. 

 
They of course have other products: long list >! The company develops and licenses its audio technologies, such as AAC & HE-AAC, a digital audio codec solution used for a range of media applications.; AVC, a digital video codec with high bandwidth efficiency used in media devices; Dolby AC-4, an audio coding technology that delivers new audio experiences to a range of playback devices; and Dolby Atmos technology for cinema and a range of media devices. Its audio technologies also include Dolby Digital, a digital audio coding technology that provides multichannel sound to applications; Dolby Digital Plus, a digital audio coding technology that offers audio transmission for a range of media applications and devices; Dolby TrueHD, a digital audio coding technology providing encoding for media application; Dolby Vision, an imaging technology for cinema and media devices; Dolby Voice, an audio conferencing technology; and HEVC, a digital video codec with high bandwidth efficiency to support for media devices. In addition, the company designs and manufactures digital cinema servers, cinema processors, amplifiers, loudspeakers, hardware components, video conferencing solutions, and other products for the cinema, television, broadcast, communication, and entertainment industries. Further, it offers various services to support theatrical and television production for cinema exhibition, broadcast, and home entertainment. The company serves film studios, content creators, post-production facilities, cinema operators, broadcasters, and video game designers. It sells its products directly to the end users, as well as through dealers and distributors worldwide.!<

Dolby is arguably one of the most expertly managed technology companies from a financial standpoint.  Their capital deployment philosophy includes investing in new growth technologies and rewarding shareholders with dividends and buybacks. Their balance sheet never carries any long-term debt and currently includes $1.1 billion in cash...

Seems like a steal for $93...


In with 06/18 $95 calls._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ GME gang. Please let this subreddit be things other than GME. I was all in GME. Now I'm not. You don't need to take that as a personal attack. I love you and I hope you win. Check my history I was right there with you until I decided no more. That's the way this shit goes.

I really hope you guys prove me wrong and make a 10 bagger out of GME still but we need to talk about the health of the sub. I am not Melvin captial just because I want to talk about other plays. I am not the illuminati cabel out to suck the tendies right out your portfolio.

It's toxic to try to force the entire sub to be all in on GME. When does it end? You can hold those shares literally forever and some of you will. I support continuing to talk about GME and have your mega thread but please accept that not all of us are going to follow you.

I need different tickers otherwise the dopamine doesn't hit as good. Don't get in the way of my high._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ DD - Why I think we're at the ground floor for $KLIC Due to the global microchip shortage, automation companies involved in the production of microchips are doing well, $KLIC (Kulicke and Soffa Industries, Inc) is one of them. In my opinion it's üöÄüöÄüöÄ (obligatory rockets for bullish sentiment)  for this stock.

They build automation and tools for the production of microchips. When investigating this company, I found this video to be very useful [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkdOZalpCbg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkdOZalpCbg) they seem to prioritize customer retention and have developed a configurable system from listening to customer feedback.

There's a few reasons why I think this company is going to do very well in 2021:

* They are addressing a known bottleneck. PS5s and X-Box aren't being built fast enough due to supply chain issues: [https://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-biz-playstation-5-ps5-xbox-shortage-20201217-enxdgcnydvhbhm4p3uxdk6xetu-story.html](https://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-biz-playstation-5-ps5-xbox-shortage-20201217-enxdgcnydvhbhm4p3uxdk6xetu-story.html)
   * I'm a big believer in removing bottlenecks. I assume that all companies involved in the supply chain for consoles, computers, etc. are investing in expediting their processes (similar companies to $KLIC are also doing well and business has picked up in 2020 and 2021, you can search for competitors if you want, there are similar trends).
* Solid balance sheet and positive trends:
   * Book value of approximately $13.01 per share. This is about 807 MM. For additional context, their current market cap is at 2.7 billion [https://www.zacks.com/stock/chart/KLIC/fundamental/book-value](https://www.zacks.com/stock/chart/KLIC/fundamental/book-value)
   * Zero debt [https://www.zacks.com/stock/chart/KLIC/fundamental/total-long-term-debt-quarterly](https://www.zacks.com/stock/chart/KLIC/fundamental/total-long-term-debt-quarterly)
   * Solid recent growth. Most of their 1yr growth has occurred in the last 2-3 months. I suspect this is institutional diversification, but who knows.
   * This ticker is beginning to make some noise: [https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/klic](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/klic)
   * I think this company is less vulnerable to rug-pulls, I think there's enough value, momentum and global business need for what they are doing.

There are a few risks:

* Relatively unknown company. I found it when investigating other companies. I didn't pay much attention at first. I think there's many others like me.
* COVID demand will not last forever, at least not at the current levels; however, I think there's still months, perhaps years of built up demand. I don't expect we'll go back to normal any time soon or ever. More people will continue to work from home when comparing to years like 2018.
* This is not a sexy company. I don't really mind that, but let's be honest, that's not helping in attracting any eyeballs. This is the biggest risk IMHO in the current market.
* I'm sure there's other risks that I have not identified.

**This is not investment advice, you are responsible for your own decisions**. If you choose to invest in any stock, I'd recommend you to remember that no stock is worth all your money, invest for the long run and when you think you've made adequate profits and are ready for the next opportunity, move on. Slow is smooth and smooth is fast.

Positions:

YOLOed 40 60c(07/16 expiry) @ $1.10, thinking of selling other positions to buy shares and go longer (again, no stock is worth all my money, I will not put all of my money in this ticker). This is a personal preference, to each their own.

Edit:

This post has received a bit more attention than I expected. Thanks for looking at my DD. I'll address a few things here cause I got stuff to do, would like to respond in a more personal manner, and will try to do so later.

* First and foremost, thanks for the Gold /u/Far-Escape-7553 there was no need, but the gesture   
 is much appreciated.
* Thanks for those who have offered challenging positions. I'm in the process of developing my active trading strategy and I'm trying to achieve a mixture between value+momentum for active trades. If you offered a challenge I will look into that to see if I can improve my process.
* For those who challenge my account history. Not a bot or HF drone. Long time lurker that wanted to add a bit of variety to the sub.
* Also, I think I should have said this initially:
   * I don't think this is the next meme stock, I hope it isn't because I don't want to worry too much about exiting at the right time.
   * If I'm "too right" and this booms, I do not plan to post position updates because I don't want the burden of having people hold as long as I hold.
   * If I'm wrong and this tanks, I hope that not many of you shares in the losses. Only you can determine your exit strategy, please remember to have one!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ ITT: we take guesses at the $SNDL rugpull Alright autists $SNDL just went parabolic on a wednesday. All TA indicators and analysis point to an imminent rug pull. I know this will get me downvoted to shit but fuckit lets go. 

Considering $GME went parabolic on a wednesday and collapsed on a thursday leads me to believe this is close to the summit. Now *i know i know* GME went down because brokers didnt want to allow purchase orders. 

Im not sure if its going to die altogether, but the rugpull is coming. 

Itll retrace to 2.00 by friday. Downvote away.


Edit 1: this blew up. For those of us saying this a shitpost. It sure is! Now go buy calls on sndl at open if youre feeling like a quadrupling in price over 4 days is a healthy market signal.

This isn't financial advice in any way shape or form.***

TLDR: This run is going to end with the cannabis stocks back down 50-80% or more from the levels they are at. **$CRLBF** is the real play here for the smart players that want USA exposure to the legislation. *We just like the stocks now, not later.*

Ok, listen up normies.

Yeah I'm talking to the newbies specifically because the OGs here already know everything I'm about to share, but your insufferable groupthink and movement mentality shit pissed me off enough to make a post. **Don't post DD if you have no clue. Ask someone for help and take your ridicule until someone comes along to help you.**

I used to post weekly DD on Sunday here a couple of years ago before one of you literally contacted my wife IRL. Not even kidding. So I made a new account. This is my first contribution back and I'm going to try and ensure some of you don't blow your chance at massive gains here by explaining ***what is actually going on.***

**CNBC and anybody telling you that this is just 'momentum' and 'sentiment' is lying to you. The hedge funds are playing these right along with us. Don't ask me for proof, this isn't Twitter. Reasons why they are playing with us:**

1. When there is money to be made, hedge funds and HFT funds are there before you
2. The floats are so small on these they can take sizable positions on both sides and stand to have massive gains, all the while handing you guys the bags.

That's all you need to know.

So in response to all you posting "real DD" with why these companies are the best and you're going to hold to the moon and never sell:

**I'm over it -- I can tell instantly how uninformed you are** when I read some poorly thought out DD about why CGC or TLRY or APHA is a long term play because they're talking about USA legislation. These are Canadian companies. Get your head back on straight. You're here for the trade and the bet, not for the fundamentals, and if that's it, then fine, ignore the rest of this post and pick an exit, and if not, read on so you don't hold more bags.

This place has never been one to care for fundamentals, but let me talk some sense into you so you can post some gain porn and I can tell you to fuck off instead of you guys all yelling "MaNiPuLaTiOn ShOrT LaDdErS"

Let's take a look at some of today's gainers:

(changed tickers for automod avoidance)

**$USMJay** \- Penny stock, worth absolute nothing for a reason

**$SNDL** \- Up ridiculous amount, have a billion shares outstanding, just diluted them all the other day

**$TeeRTeeC** \- Terra Tech, they grow weed, from all indications, do it poorly

**$OhGeeEye** \- lol

**$HUGE** \- Probably the only one in the lot worth a YOLO on the chance they get an acquisition like GW Pharma did but they don't have the same product portfolio or prospects GW has.

&#x200B;

Now, if you're simply playing this to get in and get out, **great for you**. The people saying (and believing) "$SNDL $10 EOW! HOLD THE LINE" and stuff like this are just absolutely brand new normies and are clueless, do not listen to them. If you yolo'd on cheap calls in Dec/Jan, congrats, take your gains and don't be like the $GME bagholders.

If you're investing in any of the names I just posted above, expect any money you put in to at some point in the next 12 months be worth approximately 20% of what it is worth now. Literally. They're far worse than the main bunch (CGC, CRON, ACB, TLRY, APHA) but the main bunch is nothing to write home about either.

&#x200B;

# THIS IS WHAT IS REALLY HAPPENING:

**Tilray had 40% short interest**. It's not $GME level, but it's pretty high. When the stock crested $40 it really started taking off, why though? Notice this week's FD option chain:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kyqeiwljeug61.png?width=917&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c1b48e12518515f09582289bd7f8a4f47a09629

Tilray has a 95M share float, those 42 calls represent roughly 1.5M shares held as a hedge just by themselves. Previous to this run up, that represents roughly 5% of the average daily volume of the stock, BY ITSELF. Those are shares that until Monday can be considered removed from the float because they're held as a hedge. They may get loaned out to be shorted, but that will only speed up the squeeze here.

***The important part: Today (2/10/21) the stock fell hard after open down to around 44 and found massive support all the way back to up 66. The most sold front week call? $40/$42 strikes. Premium when I screen shotted this? $22.20. Stocks going to pin above $60 for awhile likely, unless people are stupid enough to buy the OTM calls, in which case, it may squeeze itself higher.***

Smart hedge funds are going to pile into this, sell you the calls, shove the price up to keep selling you calls, then watch them all evaporate worthless in one of the future weeks in the chain, dump back the shares to help shove the price down, oh and did I mention? They shorted the top.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ivy78woneug61.png?width=392&format=png&auto=webp&s=0604940c09126dc6d5b96a9cc5f17e4013ae5d9d

It's just another plain old stock acting as a derivative of the option chain gamma squeeze. That's it, with a bit of short squeeze thrown in there and a WHOLE BUNCH of WSB fomo. The shorts are covering and pushing up the volume, likely re-shorting on the way up, and then you have WSB fomo'ing in to round out the total: a massive volume of 200 million shares today. You've got people that think this thing will skyrocket to 500+ (and it may) but the stakes get higher and higher each ladder up you take and the moves become more violent and more likely it comes all the way back down in short time the quicker it goes up.

Might it get there? Sure. But be prepare to take profits when it does because...

# ITS CALLED MEAN REVERSION. THIS CANT GO ON FOREVER.

Not to mention, the moves you are seeing are in completely overvalued companies, with horrible fundamentals, and poor prospects.

Oh what's that? CGC got some CBD treats for Martha, seems fitting that something ill is going on in this industry considering she went to prison for insider trading. If the dog treats get you excited about the stock, **Martha belongs here more than you do.**

200M shares today means people who were long term bag holders cashed out and the shares have turned over the float two times in two days. That also means the shorts have turned over and are now short again. It means the HFT firms are feasting on all of you. It means Citadel is making a pile on the spreads.

**What to take away: An amount of shares equal to the entire float has changed hands, or in other words, fewer reason for people to bag hold. Fewer people that have to hedge. Fewer people that have to cover. Fewer people to help stabilize any of these upper price tiers, and keep the price stable by holding, and more reason it's going to collapse sooner (or later).**

But, this IS a casino after all...

# Let's see what happened with TLRY last time this happened (oh, you're new here? Yeah, this isn't the first time):

&#x200B;

Looks eerily familiar to something else recently. Last time this occurred it traded between $100 and $300 in a single week timeframe.

For those of you that are new: **THIS IS NOT NORMAL. STOCKS DO NOT ALWAYS DO THIS. You are in the infancy of a new age of trading, but people still know, fundamentals matter a whole lot more than everyone is leading on, and these valuations are getting extremely overextended.**

Eventually, in the first squeeze Tilray bled off until the pandemic hit and it piled down to $2.43 a share. At $2.43/share, I would have bought it. Even at $10/12/14. At these levels? You're just ultimately out of touch but I look forward to the loss porn.

***So in short, again: Sir, this is a casino.***

&#x200B;

Timeline of events, and how to not become a bagholder:

1. $APHA earnings are good, stocks pop a bit, and level off
2. Legislators pull a pump and dump since they probably have calls and say planning on some laws regarding changing the schedule of cannabis (notice: we will likely NOT get outright legalization, just re-scheduling)
3. $CGC earnings are actually awful, with the caveat they have profitability on the horizon
4. $TLRY gets a UK deal
5. $TLRY starts going insane - since $APHA is a reverse merger with a .81 value share to share, it starts pumping, people start buying the lower priced cannabis stuff and entire sector starts moving on "overall strength"
6. There's no strength, there's a gamma squeeze backed by investor momentum, and a short squeeze on Tilray.
7. This is going to come back down violently then plateau out like GME and pull a slow bleed the rest of the way back down, just like the second graph I posted. There is no fundamental or even **POSSIBILITY** of better fundamentals immediately on US legislation. The cost to enter the US market will most definitely cause capex and goodwill capital outflows, and set back their profitability since there are established MSO's in the USA already. The USA opening the market to these companies will only further degrade the actual balance sheets/income statements and slow down profits and you know what institutions and shareholders like? **Yep. Profits.**
8. **Finally, how to not become a bag holder:** The market can stay irrational way, way, way longer than you expect. So this may go on for a bit, but refer back to 7. It's coming back down eventually, set expectations and pick your exit, or start to shave off your position as it goes up and let a portion of it run. Eventually, you have to sell to actually realize a gain, don't forget that. Once you do, close the chart, remove it from your watchlist, check back in on it in a month if you want to get back in when you have a clear head.

The Canadian operators are literally the last companies I'd play off a US legislation play, and one of the only ones worth owning in $APHA for the arbitrage play on the shares. But if Tilray comes crashing back down, $APHA will as well along with all of them, and you have to hope you lose a lot less on $APHA crashing than you'll make on the arbitrage between the share price.

THIS IS ALL JUST "SENTIMENT" BASED YOLOING BY THIS SUB. It has probably driven uneducated retail into the trades also - who will also become bag holders.

&#x200B;

***Let me put this in big letters for those of you that can only read big font and use crayons:***

# NONE OF THESE COMPANIES HAVE REAL USA MARKET EXPOSURE, THEY ARE CANADIAN COMPANIES. THEY DO NOT HAVE MARKET POSITIONING AND ARE NOT POISED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF US LEGALIZATION.

*IF ANYTHING: IT WILL HURT THEIR BOTTOM LINE AND SET BACK EARNINGS BECAUSE OF CAPEX AND CASH OUTFLOWS TO GET A POSITION IN THE MARKET AND SOME OF THEM WILL GO OUT OF BUSINESS BECAUSE OF IT, WHILE OTHERS WILL FALL OUT OF PROFITIABILITY TO ENTER THE MARKET AND COMPETE WITH THE REAL PLAYERS*.

&#x200B;

*^(Who are the real players? (Cresco $CRLBF and Curaleaf $CURLF)* *^(- do your own DD or wait for a post next week)**\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*)*

&#x200B;

**Conclusion: Nobody should plan on holding these long term. Don't let someone else hand you bags like I did this morning at open on the pop unless you plan to hand your bags off and find the next play.**

**You likely will not time the top. Pick a place you're ready to exit the trade, exit the trade or slowly shave your position, close the graphs and don't fomo back in. Just be done with the trade afterwards. You're likely not a cannabis multi millionaire and will not be one, unless you were loaded to the brim with low cost calls from last summer/fall or unless you literally yolo'd $10M into one of these a few weeks ago, and in that case, you belong here, congrats on your gains and fuck you.**

**THIS IS A SECTOR/FOMO SQUEEZE. AND IT WILL END. THIS IS NOT SENTIMENT AND CNBC IS TROLLING US WITH IT LIKE WE HAVE THE POWER.**

And if you think *WE* are the ones driving the price up, the hedge funds are definitely watching and playing and they can bring these down at will at almost any time they want. You're holding a lit molotov, the only question is: will you throw it before it blows up?

The rest of you? Plz fuck off with you 20 shares @ $2 on Sundial, fuck off with the "HOLD THE LINE SNDL $10 EOW", fuck off with your fomo, and **fuck off with the "movement" and "lets push this to the sky" stuff and most importantly don't post DD if you have zero clue what is going on.**

***You know what "lets push this to the sky" sounds like? Market manipulation.*** We're not in this together, I literally handed one of you a bag to hold this morning and even if they go up for another month, eventually, that bags gonna be heavy and I ain't coming back for it. I ain't tipping you either.

**These prices are insanely high for these companies. The multiples are out of control, and if you buy in at these levels, well, best of luck, I hope it works out for you. I'm fighting the fomo of extended gains, and will continue to put my money elsewhere.**

# SIR, THIS IS A CASINO.

Positions: I had the meme stocks like you literally all of them minus ACB and CGC. I took gains and bought 500 shares of Cresco prob increasing to 1,000 tomorrow, and kept the rest off the table to pay my wife's boyfriend's rent.

Disclaimer: I have Tilray puts I'm prepared to average down on and diamond hand like a real boss because this is coming back down.

**Edit:** You know what I forgot to add? Some of the biggest holders, the cannabis ETFs and funds, you know what they did today? They trimmed their positions. And they will continue to do so because of fiduciary responsibility and when you de-concentrate shares into the retail's hands, the moves will get more and more finnicky and more and more violent.

**Edit 2:** Some normie tried calling me out like I never saw this trade coming or am a hedge shill, [https://imgur.com/a/asAVkiC](https://imgur.com/a/asAVkiC) \- I had thousands of shares, these are just the trades from this month, and I'm not advocating a buy, I sold mostly all of them this morning except for adding Cresco back in. You want the gain numbers? You do the math, I'm not your math tutor, I sold like 6 minutes after open for most of them. I have Tilray puts for next week and will be buying a few months out at various strikes as it continues to climb.

*Yeah, I think these are coming back down in price sooner rather than later, that isn't extraordinary information for a common sense person.*

**THESIS**

Workhorse (WKHS) is a self-promotion scheme more than anything else. It has a history of making grandiose claims of massive contracts with big respectable corporations, yet *somehow* they never see revenue or sales from them. And finally, the USPS has zero interest in dealing with WKHS, because they already kicked them out of the contract bid before.

In short, there is a near-zero chance that WKHS will see any significant portion of the USPS contract.

Part 1: History of Self Promotion

Part 2: The USPS Contract

Part 3: WKHS Manufacturability

Part 4: Positions or Ban

\---------------

**PART 1: HISTORY OF SELF PROMOTION**

WKHS has a history of claiming big contract wins. Yet time and time again, these contracts never materialize to any significant sales. Lets review:

* [In 2017, the CEO claims they had $300 million in pre-orders](https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1113616_workhorse-ceo-300-million-in-preorders-for-plug-in-hybrid-pickup-trucks?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link)
   * Near-zero revenues for the subsequent 4 years, need I say more?
* [UPS orders 950 vehicles](https://www.trucks.com/2018/06/14/ups-order-950-workhorse-electric-delivery-trucks/)
   * In reality, WKHS delivered 50 vehicles in 2018. [Workhorse still boasts about UPS as a "blue chip customer."](https://workhorse.com/company.html?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link) But the standing 900 vehicles are *on-demand*, so UPS could do a test run with the first initial order. How'd it go? [Workhorse has been removed from UPS's sustainability reports.](https://sustainability.ups.com/media/2019-progress-report.pdf)
* Fedex ordered 20 trucks in 2016
   * Only 2 were ever delivered. [They tried to make a whole press-run about the one delivered in 2018.](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2018/05/01/1493806/0/en/Plug-Power-and-Workhorse-Provide-FedEx-Express-With-First-ProGen-Fuel-Cell-Powered-Electric-Delivery-Van.html)
* Several other examples of press releases for small amounts of trucks ordered. Many only have a small fraction of the ordered amount delivered.
* Most importantly, as far as I can tell, there's NEVER BEEN A SINGLE RE-ORDER.
* [Now the company boasts of an order for 6320 vehicles](https://ir.workhorse.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/162/workhorse-receives-purchase-order-from-pride-group)
   * Let's take a look at that fine print: "The order is split between Workhorse‚Äôs C-1000 and C-650 models and is subject to various production and delivery conditions." Yeah, we'll see how that goes.

\---------------

**PART 2: THE USPS CONTRACT**

There is a near-zero chance WHKS will see any significant win from the USPS contract. This is best conveyed by the below timeline and the statements from the competing bidders Oshkosh-Ford.

First, lets go over the situation. The USPS has been looking to find a partner/s to replace its long-life vehicles. This is a massive fleet, and the contract's estimated value is around $6.3 billion over a few years. The Workhorse timeline in this multi-year bidding process is below, but the takeaway is that there are three bidders left:

* Workhorse
* Ford-Oshkosh
* Karsan-Morgan Olsen

*I'll get in to the bull arguments and the zero-emissions vs hybrid vs diesel issues further below.*

Here is a timeline of our Workhorse bid (CREDIT TO FUZZY PANDA RESEARCH):

1. In April 2015, Workhorse advances from 40 interested suppliers to the top 15.
2. [In September 2016, **Workhorse fails to advance to the top 6.**](https://www.postal-reporter.com/blog/usps-awards-37-million-in-contracts-for-next-generation-delivery-vehicle-prototypes/)
3. Later that month, Workhorse joins a team that did advance, VT Hackney.
4. From 2017-2019 USPS tests 50 prototype vehicles
   1. In Spring 2018, a USPS employee was hospitalized when a VT Hackney-Workhorse vehicle's brakes failed and the vehicle ran uncontrollably downhill. Testing was paused for their vehicles.
   2. Other failures during testing reportedly include: Vehicle running out of range (stranded), suspension broke when hitting railroad tracks, door failures, safety belt failures, and motors failing.
5. In November 2019, VT Hackney sold its stake in a potential $6.3 billion contract to Workhorse [for a mere $1m + $6.6m WKHS stock](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1425287/000162828019013414/wkhs-20191031.htm).

So, given the above, how are WKHS bulls so optimistic on their chances of winning? Well, it has to do with Biden's statements that he wants to [replace the entire US fleet with EV](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/biden-starts-the-electric-vehicle-race-with-big-plans-to-replace-the-federal-fleet-11611697897). He's also made comments on targeting a large percentage of zero-emissions vehicles. Remember, Karsan-Morgan Olson's proposal was a hybrid. And Oshkosh-Ford's proposal was Diesel. Only Workhorse had a true zero-emission proposal.

I use past tense because these are dynamic situations. And recent comments by Oshkosh management indicate that they plan to leverage Ford's recently announced E-transit (100% electric) as a potential option. See the following statements:

>‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got a very strong, very comprehensive bid that meets all of the needs of the U.S. postal service. So I mean, I‚Äôll repeat that, we do meet all the needs of the U.S. Postal Service. Meaning, if they want, under the Biden administration, more weight toward one type of propulsion than another, we‚Äôre ready for that. Now we‚Äôve got our fingers crossed. We believe we‚Äôve got high reliability solutions and hope to have good news at the next earnings call,‚Äù John Pfeifer, president and chief operating officer of Oshkosh, said in a call with investors last week.  
>  
>Pfiefer said he expects the Postal Service to make a decision in March. [\[Source\]](https://www.trucks.com/2021/02/01/electric-mail-trucks-make-sense/)

And in the very recent earnings call (you can google transcripts, this website cannot be linked):

>**Michael Shlisky (Analyst)**  
>  
>I also want to ask a quick follow up on another question about the USPS contract. Your opinion is based on the Ford Transit, I believe, and we've gotten since this last quarter, we just announced we just heard the announcement of the new Ford e-transit coming out here in 2021 so you comment that you can address whatever the USPS‚Äôs needs are as far as our power train. Is it as simple as just substituting the transit for the e-transit or do you have to have a special reopening on the contract and new approval to kind of make that switch?  
>  
>**John Pfeifer (COO, Oshkosh)**  
>  
>So there's limited things that I can say about this program, not because I don't want to but because we're under a pretty tight confidentiality with the USPS. We don't have to reopen anything to address the needs that as they evolve with the contract. I really can't comment on the transit ban, because of confidentiality, but I can say that we don't need to go back and have some arduous task of reopening an agreement if the contract goes one way or another, we will not have to do that.  
>  
>**Wilson Jones (CEO, Oshkosh)**  
>  
>I think the foundational statement there is we furnished a program vehicles that meet their current and future needs. I think that's the best way to leave it, Mike.

So USPS has the following options:

1. Work with the no-name vendor with a history of catastrophic vehicle failures in its small testing batch.
2. Work with Oshkosh-Ford to update their proposal to include some reduced-emissions diesel vehicles for 2021/2022 delivery. These can be used in the future for rural environments with limited charging infrastructure. The 2022-2025 deliveries could be electric vehicles based on the best selling cargo van, the Ford Transit (E-transit).

Note the specific situation in #2 is pure speculation on my part. But either way, it is not a hard choice. Ford-Oshkosh has this in the bag. \[I haven't gone in to why Karsan-Morgan Olson isn't a strong candidate, since it seems like that is universally understood. I do believe they are likely a solid backup for a small % of the USPS contract, though.\]

\---------------

**PART 3: WKHS MANUFACTURABILITY**

I'll keep this short because it is already getting long. Workhorse has never produced its vehicles at this scale, ever. This is a massive risk. There's zero reason for USPS or others to take that risk on. I know, WKHS bulls say "Lordstown" like it means something.

This means nothing. Having a facility is not enough. Cars have tens of thousands of complex moving parts and require precise assembly and process controls.  If you don't work as an engineer, you cannot imagine the effort that comes in to developing, maintaining, and scaling a manufacturing process this complex. Until Lordstown can demonstrate that it can crank these vehicles out, it is simply a manufacturing space.

\---------------

**PART 4: YOLO**

Ford calls, Oshkosh calls, Workhorse puts. For those less risky, be sure to buy April calls and puts, since the USPS contract could be announced in late March. I have enough fodder to double down on FDs if my current March 19th OSK and WKHS positions expire before a decision.

It's a good metric to get a lead on potential value plays (LOL at WSB turning into a value stock forum, way to go DFV), but there's more to look at.

Book value tells you if the company has underlying value or if it's just a house of cards. Price to book ratio tells you *what the market thinks of that underlying value.* In this case, almost nil. A good question to ask when you see a metric that seems way too positive to pass up is, why are other people passing it up?

First, more about the company: they do mobile networks, sat TV, finance (credit cards), and infosec services. They also do some robotics cause it's fun?

Telecom was one of the worst performing sectors over the past year, by the way. This can be a positive if you're a value investor-it means the price may be depressed by the broader industry.

To the stock itself, the value play isn't as strong as the price to book makes it out to be. Again, if that tells you it has underlying value, great. But is it making any money? Price to earnings is 8 or 9 (depending if you're looking at the past year or projected), compared to 12ish for the industry, another good sign. Earnings growth projections are positive also, but not phenomenal. ~~Negatively, they did not pay a dividend last year, which is like value investor 101: show me the dividend!~~ **Correction: evidently they typically announce dividends in the spring, and backdate the ex date to the prior year, which is why no sites are showing a 2020 divided yet.** But they did announce a share buy back and a 2021 dividend. They have a comparatively small market, and have branched out internationally as a result. That can be expensive.

Tl;dr - I think there are positive signs for a long term value play, but what this company is lacking is meaningful growth. The point of investing is to make money, not just hold value.

I'm going to watch it, because if they do a spin off or some other move to position for innovation or greater market share then it could be poised to take off._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ SNDL Short Volume Comparisons: Highest Daily Short Volume for 2021 at Over 150% of Float!

Either it's all a bunch of retards or some organized folks making the posts (or both)...

It's like you could just start a pump based off news like earnings or a weed merger or whatever, and then try to keep the pump going higher using retail investors who will never exit when they should. Easy extra gains if you can manipulate the market already with large volume alone and then get a bunch of retards to buy due to FOMO.

I'm really skeptical of all of these stocks that have already gone parabolic and you get these people saying it will still "go to the moon" with no counter arguments. Yea maybe they will but maybe they won't but nobody knows for sure.

If the US political cycle had shown us anything, it's that it is easy to manipulate people on the internet. Feelings will often win over facts too (apes strong yada yada)... it's like playing the lottery but with bigger consequences.

Retail investors do have power again, but that power could be so easily pulled one way or another by these meme stocks.

All I'm saying is do your own research before yoloing your retirement away or getting into debt.... These trading algorithms are now probably just waiting for enough people to start another stock meme, then pump it up, get you to buy high, and then leave us retail retards holding the bags._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Moderator Change Announcement With all of the recent changes in the subreddit recently, we have decided to wait until things have calmed down to announce that Mr. Martin Shkreli has been removed as a moderator.

Without the üíéüëê,  Melvin Capital & Citadel would have spewed enough propaganda via Jim Cramer and the rest of CNBC's GREEDY Citadel's deep pocketed-lined talking heads swaying via Citadel's bribes / donations to their "expert" anchors, analysts, supreme "analyzed" research. The average stubborn, impossible boomer will *follow* exactly.what they see on CNBC and affiliated "researched reports" along with their strategic plays. 


**CERTAIN** Manipulating Hedge funds (Melvin Capital and Citadel) always buy low, hype it via CNBC through the faces of their puppets and sell the highest when it makes enough profits for them to slowly start shares causing minimal peaking while staying under the radar.


Don't forget how much these scumbags made off the market crashes from 2008 thru 2009. 


Hey Melvin, I'm sorry to hear that you weren't able to get GameStop cheap enough to cover you shorts. Citadel, I'm sorry you wasted all of that sweet sweet bailout money you gave to Melvin Capital to just have the temporary bandages blown off and now it will be even more painless when you swing right through strike 2. you may have had the boomers fooled with your fake news,. Citadel, but us diamond hands knew better.. we started a family,  very close tight-knit family who depending on each and others's ginormous balls and heart-felt promises to connectings of OUR FAMILY!!


**DON'T FUCK WITH MY FAMILY MOTHER FUCKERS!** 


These üíé üëê are not going away, we love playing "Guess how much Melvin lost today?" You greedy fucks deserve to lose fair and square as us retail traders do not have the same advantage to produce sudden "glitches" with your Robinhood exchange puppets, your "Sell GME and hurry to silver before you miss out on the NEXT BIG THING.. 


Grosses part, the FUCKING TREASURER OF THE FUCKING UNITED FUCKING STATES HAD PUBLICLY ACCEPTED ALMOST $1,000,000, YES, ALMOST ONE MILLION DOLLARS IN "DONATIONS" FROM CITADEL TO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF THE VOLATILITY OF "CERTAIN" YET-UNNAMED STOCKS THAT MELVIN CAPITAL WAS LOSING BILLIONS IN THEIR RIDICULOUS SHORTS COVERING MORE THAN 100% OF A STOCK. SINCE WHEN THE FUCK CAN YOU OWN MORE THAN 100% OF A COMPANY? HOW IS THAT LEGAL TO BET SHORTS AT 122%,.140% -- WHERE'S THESE COUNTERFEIT STOCKS???


OH RIGHT!! MELVIN CAPITAL CAN JUST KEEP ISSIING FAILURE TO DELIVERS (FD'S) AND PEOPLE BELIEVE THEY ARE RECEIVING THEIR SHARES, WHEN IN FACT, THEY ARE IOU's!!! And they just play the victim of "oh there was a glitch, and this happened, blah blah blah) SEC and FINRA slap them on the wrist, during their luncheon at their offices.

Here are a few lessons from the wild swing in stocks like $GME, $BB, $AMC, $NOK that are being discussed endlessly here:

* Nobody here is going to handhold a noob! If you haven‚Äôt ever traded in the stock-market , don't come to these forums to ***learn*** *to invest or trade.* 
* The forums may be a good place to gauge the sentiment on stocks, but ***not*** to gather *real* investment insights
* Gain and Loss porn posts by fellow retards may be entertaining but sometimes it is just that - entertainment. There may not be much to learn from their *experience*
* Recent swing in Gamestop (GME) stock has shown that a herd of retail investors alone can't sustain the momentum in stock price, especially if the underlying fundamentals aren't supporting it.
* You alone are responsible for gains and losses in *your* portfolio. Remember, you and I also have bills to pay.

Learn to invest wisely_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Wed AM Gamma Analysis & Trading Day Retrospective on GME, TLRY, APHA, SNDL, CRSR, AMC Below is a dump of a bunch of popular tickers. Some don't have spotgamma data, but all have tradingvolatility data. This data is a bit stale - it's Wednesday AM data, so whatever happened today changed it in terms of option open interest.

[https://imgur.com/a/bEpZEBz](https://imgur.com/a/bEpZEBz)

**How to interpret:**

Whenever there is call or put open interest, it COULD BE options dealers are net sellers. Whatever the net 'short gamma' (total net options sold) by dealers will in turn result in gamma hedging as the price of the stock moves past. This generally means that dealers buy if the price going up, and sell if price going down, regardless of if they have short puts or short calls on the books. This effect can be as much as 80% of the total options outstanding in my experience, but is usually less. This caused a lot of the GameStop action we saw before known as a gamma squeeze.  It is possible to create the reverse, and that's a hobby of Steve "Stevie" Cohen (to sell a giant straddle and lock the price down). If a stock seems to be de-volatilized after I said it had a lot of gamma, there's some chance this happened.

Delta de-hedging is also a thing. When options expire, speculators (read: you) tend to sell the itm options for profit, and tend not to roll them fully, which causes reversion against the options. In other words, if there are a lot of ITM puts expiring, the stock will tend to go up, while if there are a lot of ITM calls expiring, the stock will tend to go down. This tends to matter the most on the monthly and quarterly and yearly option expirations. This Friday appears to not be one of those.

Because this data is stale, you can't draw firm conclusions, and you'd want the update tomorrow if you have access to these tools (spotgamma and tradingvolatility, or you can add by hand). However, it's important to understand the magnitude of these gamma hedging effects by dealers. These are always relative to the floating shares of the stock. For reference:

AMC: 114m shares (Maybe, they just had a bunch of new issuances and debt conversion, could be higher)

CRSR: 88.1m shares

SNDL:435m shares

APHA:312m shares

TLRY: 137m shares

GME: 70m shares

In my experience, if a price move will involve 20% or more of the shares in open interest (options contracts x 100), it will tend to cause gamma squeeze effects in a lot of speculation. Numbers under this will still impact. It starts being not very noticeable at 5% or less for a price range (such as a 20% spread). Typically the price ranges you would look to would be plausible price ranges.

Today, a lot of weed stocks ran all the way up their gamma ramps and stalled, which means new gamma ramps need to be constructed, and I would expect it to be harder to move these weed stocks up more tomorrow except for SNDL (more on that below) For this reason, you will need to look CLOSELY at the new options printed for end of week and on as of tomorrow AM (or Thursday) when option data comes out. Right now, these stocks will look like all downside - gamma ramp below current position, since those stocks ripped through their gamma ramps completely today.

**Edit: Thursday 2:20pm EST analysis:**

All stocks at the end of the day require NET BUYERS to go up.  My interpretation with the broad collapse of 420 stocks is just that people took profits/not enough new buyers. The gamma ramps that can shoot stocks up ALSO can shoot them down if you run out of buyers and go to net selling. That appears to be what is happening. That also means if there are inflows they can shoot back up though.

**Brief analysis:**

**GME**: I honestly have no idea. The stock is for sure gamma dominated right now, and getting past this expiry will reduce volatility a lot as things roll off the book. Interesting, there are a LOT of puts and most of the purchases of options appear to be puts right now.

**TLRY**: This just ripped through a gamma ramp, forcing buy of a remaining 5 or so million shares on the float of 137, which is a small effect. Most of the buying today was thus new capital coming in, which is quite remarkable. Looking at the OI tomorrow for expiry friday will be very important in understanding what is going on, but, **THIS STOCK WAS FUELED BY PURE NEW BUYING AND NEW CALL OPTION PURCHASE.** I guess there's no substitute for being "The" weed stock. Just remember that every dollar up requires the same amount of new capital as the last dollar - 50% days get a lot harder when already up 50% the day before. New gamma ramps will be created, but these get harder as IV has already risen a lot. Thus, would expect the momentum to continue, but this will quickly go into a bubble state like GME did, and we can in turn expect a spectacular pop when people get distracted and move on to the new shiney. Be cautious! I'll do more TLRY bubble analysis below.

**APHA**: This also just fully ripped through gamma ramp, and in fact did on Tuesday. At this point, it's all dependent on new open interest creation and money. Gamma ramp wasn't actually that big though, and the forced selling friday is small. This appears to mostly just be straight buying.

**SNDL**: I don't have data on spotgamma, so I had to rely on just tradingvolatility.com. My read is that this stock has an outrageous amount of gamma, on the order of the float of the stock, and you can expect more vol. This leads me to suspect that the float data isn‚Äôt accurate (outstanding shares are 1.5b while float is stated to be 436m). There are some moderate ITM call expirations Friday, on the order of 15-20m shares on a float of 435m shares, so I don‚Äôt expect a huge impact.  But, this stock appears to be pretty spring-loaded with options and could go nuts again.  Examining data tomorrow will be important.

**CRSR**: This isn‚Äôt actually that gamma dominated at a float of 88m. It‚Äôs right in the middle of a decent sized gamma ramp, so buying will send it up somewhat faster ‚Äì and selling will send it down somewhat faster. Friday expirations are not that significant. This stock will behave semi-normally as a result.

**AMC**: I‚Äôm not sure what the float is here, but the actual option OI suggests AMC is in the middle of a gamma ramp, and that gamma ramp is immensely strong relative to float ‚Äì this stock is expected to continue a lot of volatility unless these options are a bunch of covered calls or covered puts. My suspicion from price action is that they are not, and this will keep being very volatile. This ramp will lose strength in the 8s, so it will require a much heavier lift to get past there. Friday expirations are immaterial. Selling also can send it down, much like CRSR.

&#x200B;

**TLRY Bubble Analysis**

Tilray long ago on about 75m shares got to $180 in a bubble, and that popped a little without insider lockup... when lockup happened it killed a new surge in jan 2019, sending it down a bit to $70.  We are now at 130m shares outstanding.  That means the shares outstanding went up 73%, and float probably is up a bit more post-lockup, so let's call it 80%. 70 bucks divided by 1.8 is $40, which represents similar mini-bubble prices, which we are over. Therefore, while I think this can and probably will go higher, I don't think we are going to hit the $180 easily. We might see $100 or $120. But I think this is starting to get into heavy lift territory.  Another view would be to see that GME was about $10b-$15b of retail money in, and TLRY market cap is $8b already.  If I think GME was max retail money in, maybe TLRY can get half of that. That puts a barrier on it getting past the low to mid 100s in my opinion. My advice is - this looks like it's beginning to be a bubble - best practice in a bubble is to not get greedy, and take profits as you go. Bubbles pop when new money in slows. I personally don't trade them because they are my worst trading skill. Good luck!

**Vulture Strategy**

Whenever everyone is FOMOing hard over these stocks, they tend to dump prior favorites to buy - stuff like NFLX, TSLA, whatever the last memes were, random banned stocks here that we also watch. Some of those favorites are quality stocks, and others are the next meme next week that aren't yet in the limelight. If you have long-standing S&P500 or Nasdaq-100 stocks that are down for no real reason big tomorrow (and today), or a meme favorite, you may just want to snag some shares cheap if you aren't feeling these stocks. May see some more flash sales.

*My positions: I own none of these!  But I'm long the market, and you guys dumping your winners to buy TLRY and similar is I think why NDX took a dump this morning, and that kind of hurt. Fortunately I did hold, and did buy the dip, and did buy TSLA calls. Which I'll regret because you'll probably sell more TSLA to buy more TLRY tomorrow. I intend to enter into positions on none of these, because I'm a square.*

Do you guys know something that I don't?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Goodbye. _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ APHA vs TLRY Arbitrage creating biggest short squeeze  

A lot of people are making the APHA vs TLRY Arbitrage play in the past few days, that is, buying APHA and shorting the same amount of TLRY, thinking it is free money based on the "future" share exchange ratio after the merger. What they didn't realize is that they are helping to increase short interest in TLRY and adding oil to one of the biggest short squeezes in stock history, that is unfolding in front of us right now.

Let me explain, in the long term they would be right "eventually", either APHA is too cheap or TLRY is too expensive. However at the moment stock market doesn't have to make sense and can head in the opposite direction for a prolong period of time, and as TLRY gets higher it will trigger broker's automatic short-covering at \*any\* price when some shorters' net balance get close to zero. This will push TLRY even higher and shake out more accounts, triggering a snowball effect. Unfortunately, there is no way to convince your broker that your APHA "long" shares are as good as TLRY shares and that you are self-sufficient. In fact, these APHA shares also take away some of your cash balance and contribute to the automatic short-covering.

I haven't seen this kind of short squeeze before and would welcome any thoughts._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ LAST WEEK - "You fucking morons, those degenerates don't give a fuck about silver.

In these mergers hedge funds usually make their money by doing something they deem risk free called arbitrage. By shorting the expensive stock and being long on the less expensive stock it doesn't matter if the stocks go up or down the only thing that matters is that on the merger date they would be worth whatever the price paid for them is. 

So in $TLRY and $APHA case in an arbitrage position the profit is the difference between where they are now and where it would be if $APHA is 83% of $TLRY stock price.

So here is where we could blow up the hedge funds.

SHORT SQUEEZE $TLRY. 

Instead of TLRY becoming closer to that 17% premium the difference in price has widened and there is a lot of institutional shorting going on. Short interest is currently 37% of the free float. One out of every three shares floated is being shorted.  

On a low volume stock. 

TLRY could also with that higher share price renegotiate the deal and get more APHA shares or look for a different target to merge with.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Listen up y‚Äôall. I know we hate contrarians here, but hopefully, some of you monkeys can put on your thinking hats for a second and gather ‚Äòround. Remember, true diamond hands don‚Äôt care if the stock goes up or down, they observe the facts and make sound decisions based on them to amplify their own profits. Now let‚Äôs learn some basic corporate finance together.

We need to talk about TLRY.

As you all know, TLRY spiked today‚Ä¶and the day before‚Ä¶etc‚Ä¶up to almost $70 per share. Some of you made money on calls, and I‚Äôm proud of you, but this pump is going to end and I‚Äôm here to explain why.

Obviously, everyone is going to point to the obvious to counter my short term bear view - the merger with Aphria. I‚Äôm not going to waste your time telling you why this merger might not even happen; no - instead I‚Äôm going to humor you and assume it does in my simple analysis. I‚Äôm going to use only numbers directly from TLRY‚Äôs merger announcement presentation, which you scrubs can find [here](https://ir.tilray.com/static-files/42b99b9b-5574-499d-b266-aabd0393103e).

Let‚Äôs start with two basic facts:

TLRY Current Share Count: 158.3 million

APHA Current Share Count: 316.7 million

Now, the merger proposal says essentially this: the two companies will become one company ‚Äì nothing will happen to TLRYs stock (it will roll over into the new company), but Aphria‚Äôs stock will be converted into TLRY shares at a ratio of 0.84:1. This ratio is our first new term of the day: the conversion ratio.

We can multiply the Aphria share number by this ratio to get the number of shares it converts into pursuant to the merger. The resultant number is about 282 million shares. Now we add this to the number of TLRY shares that roll over, and we have a total outstanding shares post-merger of \~440 million. This number is called the Pro-forma shares outstanding.

Now, we take the Pro-forma shares outstanding and multiply that by the share price (everyone is saying this whole pump is share-price merger arbitrage anyways) to get the Pro-forma market cap: a whopping $30 billion US dollars!

Carrying on with the valuation‚Ä¶we add the merged company‚Äôs debt to the market cap to get enterprise value (I'm not worrying about cash for you hardos out there, just trying to illustrate a point here) ‚Äì and we get an enterprise value of 31ish billion dollars. This is essentially the value of the Company as indicated by the market.

Now we can start looking at multiples. You may be asking yourself, young monkey, ‚ÄúWhy do multiples matter?‚Äù. Well, they essentially give us a way to value stocks relative to one another. This type of valuation, simply enough, is known as relative valuation and is used every day by the top investment banks and hedge funds in the world. One useful multiple in sales-driven businesses like this (especially those with no positive cash flows) is the enterprise value to revenues multiple. Generally, companies trade in a range that the market considers fair. Google is trading about 7x for example. Tesla is at 20 something. Other weed companies are in the 20s geenrally. We can calculate this ratio for the merged company in question using the combined revenue figure provided in the merger documents and it comes out to‚Ä¶..43.9x. Let me say that again: 43.9x. That‚Äôs saying this weed company that makes virtually no money on a net basis should be trading at higher multiples than even Tesla, one of the most historically high multiple stocks out there. This is so, so, so overvalued. A classic pump.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/xzvunu13trg61.png?width=753&format=png&auto=webp&s=0534676fa415203dce905ff045d66bb79e37695d

Just for shits and gigs I did this same analysis just looking at TLRY as a standalone company in the event there is no merger, and at current prices, the EV/LTM Revenue multiple is even higher at 60x. 60!

I just want to make sure you all don‚Äôt get shafted here. You should not be paying this much for a Company with no earnings. Notes these numbers are conservative - I'm not even accounting for further dilution from insider options and convertible securities because you apes probably can't handle it. And don‚Äôt tell me ‚Äúit‚Äôs about the potential‚Äù. Potential isn‚Äôt realized through a press release, and you know it.

Furthermore, legalization takes a long time to implement and these guys aren‚Äôt even US focused. Seriously ‚Äì read their securities filings.

Also, keep in mind this merger was announced in December, and nothing materially altering profitability has been announced since then. WHY THE RUNUP? You're getting fleeced lads._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Being on the other side of the weed stock rally

My question, is why are people investing in Canadian based weed growers/distributors on potential for it to be federally legal in the United States? Why would it be profitable for the US to import all of its weed in the case that it does become legal on a federal level? Don't international trade tariffs and everything else that goes iwth importing foreign goods make it less than ideal, when compared to growing it domestically? Sure, there is some % that is legal imported for medical use, and research pruposes (TLRY and CGC) but how much is really being imported today, and will it stay like that if its federally legalized in the US. It's not like its that hard to grow it here either - most of the US has a climate for it, and if it doesn't you can build greenhouses. Am I missing something here?

The problem is, there don't seem to be any US based, publicly traded weed growers/distributors. So people just flocked to the Canadian ones. I don't get it._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ APHA reverse merger w/ TLRY - let math make you money Did you miss out on all the pot stock hype today? Good news there is still a great sleeper play out there . This has been discussed in r/stocks and here in WSB weeks and it‚Äôs simple merger math. 

Buy APHA not TLRY.  Why? Because APHA will convert to TLRY shares for a profit at a .838 to one. In other words 100 shares of APHA will convert to 83.8 TLRY shares.  One TLRY share at close was $63.80  and one APHA only $26.34.

83% of $63.80 is $53.46.

APHA is trading at a $28 per share discount! 

APHA is a great company and actually the one buying TLRY (Reverse merger) the two are poised to do very well with legalization and the tickers will switch in the 2Q of This year.

"culture". We are all here for a single reason: To make money on high risk plays.

Gains made overnight, or by holding through hell and high water, are to be equally celebrated. 

Losses should be mocked, derided, and if unique enough, given the high honor of being put into automod.

At all costs, if we are to remain different than the rest of reddit, we must avoid the following:

* Politics, we're not here to change the world (sorry) - we just like the stock.

* Divisiveness, calling people bots and shills because they disagree with you only reduces diversity of thought, and drives away our best members.

* Repetitive content, we have just barely enough IQ points to focus on multiple stocks at once, not everything has to be GME or Weedstocks.

* Know it alls, remember rule 7 - "No Bullshitting". Stay humble and ask about what you don't know. After being insulted a few times, someone will help you out.

#What you can do to keep this place great

* Upvote new and interesting ideas. No one wants to see the front page filled with threads on the same stock or sector.

* Mock people for not understanding something and doing their research, and don't speak beyond your knowledge.

* Bring your own creative ideas to the table! Pick the dumbest company (over $1B market cap) and really read into their filings and let us know what you find!

* Keep content related to megathread topics in the megathread.

* Don't ask "what the next move is" - WSB is not your personal army, there is no agenda, no one speaks for WSB, and we don't "pump and dump" anything. Simply, we are a watering hole for risk loving individuals.

#What we're doing to keep this place great

* The whole mod team has been working overtime, clearing out low quality content and keeping things fresh. Less than 1% of threads make it out of /new.

* In the absence of u/zjz's incredible bots, we're building new tools to assist with moderation efforts, but remain hopeful that zjz can return soon.

* We're planning some fun community events. Can't say too much, but those of you who have been around will know. Guess we'll have to wait and see.

* We will be reintroducing stickied DD threads. These will be automatically stickied based on flair, with high account age restrictions.

#Why was my post/comment removed? CORRUPT!

Over the past week, there were multiple *really good* DDs and YOLOs on PRPL, FNKO, SNDL, and many other stocks. The kind of stuff that gives you hope that the old WSB is very much alive.

But you may have missed them because the front page was dominated with GME related talk. 

Don't let the bandwagoners steal your fresh DD. Downvote spam and low effort posts, upvote innovative posts.

#A note on the moderation team:

The team we currently have (missing you u/zjz) is the best we've ever had. Everyone on this team is entirely committed to keeping the subreddit stable and top notch.

This mod team is a completely different beast than the two mod teams evicted over the past year. They are the ones who have actually put work into the subreddit over the years, and aren't just inactive. They have poured their souls into this sub for years. Yes, some are using throwaways because they'd rather not get doxxed (again), but if my vouch isn't enough, u/zjz vouched for them as well.

Making everyone a mod for a week, paper trading competitions, automod responses, the discord and plenty of other fun facets of the subreddit were done by this very team. If you don't know what I'm talking about at this point, stick around. You'll have a blast.

P.S. Dear SEC Intern: We don't endorse any tickers or movements. We're just here to trade and make dick jokes._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ NTDOY is the most undervalued company, how do you not see this? Srsly, how has everyone missed this undervalued gem. Let's break this down simple:

1. This thing has a PE ratio under 18 putting its valuation lower than other boring value stocks like Cisco, Comcast, or Walmart. You even get a 1% dividend yield which is more than your Chase saving account provides you. You'd think having such a low PE under JPow's economy would mean this is a dead company with no prospects, but...

2. Their latest game console, the Nintendo Switch which has been out since March 2017 keeps selling units by the millions. 80 million Switch devices sold to date, 15 million of them in 2020 alone. They're still selling at a consistent pace at the mid-cycle of the console's lifespan. This would be bad if they sold it at a loss like new game consoles from the competition, but...

3. The Switch is cheap. You can get the Switch Pro for less than $300, or the lite for $200. When your console is so cheap not only can you sell it at a profit but your customers have more money to buy games. And who makes those games?

4. Nintendo has basically a monopoly on Switch games taking all the profit. This isn't particilarly hard when you own excellent IPs that raise nostalgia levels so high. All their 15 top selling games are self-published, 9 of them solely developed by then. Their top 6 each sold over 20 million copies, they're in 25+% of Switch owners. This is important when you factor in that 80% of games sold in 2020 were released in prior fiscal years so new Switch Owner will buy these same old games that already broke cost. And with such popular IPs they can even release phone quality games or emulated 10-20 year old parts at $50 for cash grabs. Only stronger competition could stop them, but...

5. You can't get a new Playstation or Xbox. Srsly, have you tried buying one? You get a notification from Best Buy that they have some in stock and that same minute when you try adding to cart it's already sold out. Despite the demand, the supply chain is so backlogged that less than 5 million PS5s have been sold.

6. CHINA - did you know that video game consoles were banned there until 2014? The Switch wasn't even launched there officially until 2019. This is a nascent new region for the expansion of the videogame industry, especially today when less than 2 million Switch/Ps4/xbox ones were sold. Of those, 1.3 million were Switch meaning they already have over 2/3s of this nascent new market share. As more chinese come out of poverty and try out these game consoles from their rich software engineer cousins who came to visit them from California, they will demand regulatory change to make it easier for video game consoles to sell in the country.

7. What about growth outside the videogame market? Well, they might be the future leaders of AR games. Mario Kart Live? Mario Legos? What other toy companies have you seen pushing the boundaries of AR? With their excellent IPs it should be easy to dominate the toys market, with total global market size of $100B.

8. All that hype is all well but what to the actual numbers say? Well, this baby had a Q1 - Q3 YoY growth in Net Sales of 37.3%! But there's more! The Operating Profit grew by 98.2% and the Net Profit by a similar 91.8%. How is this not a growth company? Stock is up 67% YoY but keeps being valued at low PE üòÆ

1. Why would you ever put money into a HEXO that‚Äôs up over 100% in the last month that just went through a 4/1 reverse split to be eligible to be put on the NYSE???

Well let me answer that question for you children. HEXO OWNS THE #1 POSITION IN WEED DRINKS IN CANADA! They own 42.5% of Truss, A company that is targeting the 71% of Canadian pussies who get turned off of weed because they have to smoke it. I‚Äôve never met someone who hates being high (under the correct circumstances) but I know a lot of people who hate it smoke. What if they can üçπ it?? Do you understand the potential, currently weed beverages are currently 1.9% of the Canadian market (1.4 US), experts agree that weed bev‚Äôs can grow to 15% weeds total sales

2. But let‚Äôs talk about how much money are they are losing... because they did lose $170m million in the Q2. They only lost 4.2m in Q3üöÄüöÄ. Not to mention CGC, currently having one of the largest market cap evaluations at 20B market cap only posted 440M net rev, compared to HEXO‚Äôs 41M with only a 1.24B market cap. Now let‚Äôs get to what everyone wants to here about. Are they really growing though? 

3. TLDR on weed stance 

Heavily invested in Quebec, Greece, and Colorado. They aren‚Äôt branding any further currently (waiting for American legalization imo). They produce way more bud then they can sell but because the price of a gram has fallen from 5.29 last year to under $3 now they have been able to ram up sales and cut their net losses to only 4milly last q. They are still producing 50% more weed than they can sell ready for a wave of legalization to expand their cannibals reach.

Main highlights highlights. Up 114% in gross revenue from the comparative prior year. Net revenue is up 103%. Expanding reach into Alberta(18% total sales), Ontario(15%), and British Columbia(6%). They have the #1 market share in Quebec. Each province having a strong tourist presence. They currently have 150m in straight cash.

The SEC has previously warned that short sellers can hide their shorts through some trickery with the help of market makers. Well we have data reported by FINRA showing how much naked short selling was done by market makers through the end of January too, there was an explosion of 4.6 million shares of Short Exempt Volume by market makers, which could have been used to help short sellers hide their positions. (FINRA notes they don‚Äôt capture all data, and their total trading volume seems to be a little less than half that shown on Yahoo Finance. Thus presumably to account for the full trading volume of activity we need to more than double the sample FINRA publishes. In other words **10.2 million shares could have been hidden by market makers given the high Short Exempt Volume through the end of January**.)

\--

[Link](https://postimg.cc/47jdfqtF) of the data pulled from FINRA, notice the jump in Short Exempt Volume highlighted in yellow starting January 13th, showing market makers selling naked shorts. Notice how the Short Exempt Volume has only grown as we moved into February, even though overall trading volume has trended down. This indicated to me that the market makers might be playing a larger role in hiding even more shorts in February potentially.

Combining the official short shares and the potentially hidden short shares, we get to 31.6 million shares, representing 67% of float at the end of January.

\--

FINRA data shows short sales represented more than half of FINRA trading volume throughout February, leading to the conclusion shorts have been increasing their stake against the company again opportunistically at higher prices this month. Some of the shorting likely was done by high frequency algos that typically close their position by day end, but the short volumes were so high it would be impossible to close all the shorts out given the limited volume. If there were no other buyers, and only short sellers opening and closing their positions throughout February, conservatively there would be a net 11.8 million new shorts that went unclose based on FINRA data, and if that is inflated to account for the trading volume FINRA is not capturing, then there may have been a total of **29.1 million new shares shorted in February**.

\--

Bringing it all together.

21.4 million short shares officially reported by FINRA for end of January.

\+10.2 million shares potentially hidden by market makers through Short Exempt Volume in January.

\+29.1 million new shares shorted through February 9th.

**60.7 million shares short in total through February 9th by my estimates, representing 129% of float presently.**

\--

The table below shows a rough estimate of the cumulative portion of shorts that would be underwater with losses at each price point. This was roughly estimated using the price ranges and short volumes by trading day. A**t a $50 share price around 40% of the shorts are underwater by my estimates, and at a $100 share price around 75% would be underwater, and by a price of $150 more than 80% of shorts would be underwater.** In other words, going above those price points would put pressure on an increasingly larger portion of the shorts to close out their positions.

$450 = 98%

$400 = 96%

$350 = 94%

$300 = 92%

$250 = 88%

$200 = 84%

$150 = 81%

$100 = 74%

$50 = 42%

\--

This analysis can be improved upon with more detailed trading volume data by the minute, but this was based on day end volumes and price ranges. It also assumes the official short shares reports by FINRA at the end of January only represent about a third of all the shorts that actually exist today. Despite being very rough estimates, these are intended to illustrate the prices that may potentially be key pain point prices for short sellers.

\--

**TLDR - shorts are hiding their shorts position which the SEC is aware of. A lot of short exempt volume in the last couple of weeks. Short interest is most likely at 129% vs 78%. üöÄüöÄüöÄ**

Pick operationally profitable companies.

Most of the tickers thrown around in this sub havn‚Äôt had a single profitable quarter. Sure revenues are up, costs are down but the revenues aren‚Äôt up enough and costs aren‚Äôt down enough. Can this business operate in the black today? Because if they can‚Äôt then expansing to a larger facility won‚Äôt solve their woes. 

There‚Äôs a saying in martial arts: If you can‚Äôt do it slow, you can‚Äôt do it fast. So pick a weed grower that can grow and sell their product for a profit. This should be the backbone of any op. Income from stakes in other businesses or changes in valuation of inventory are some tricks used to cook the books. You‚Äôll see many of these tickers issue shares, warrants whatever and that is your sign to gtfo.

So who is profitable? AFAIK APHA pre-TLRY merger. I‚Äôm not confident APHA can turn around the TLRY operation. I‚Äôd look at MSOs that are operating in the black for my picks for the coming green rush. Good luck all and remember: SHIT WEED DONT SELL._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ The weed rally has nothing to do with GME No, the upward movement in cannabis stocks is not a concerted distraction by Wall Street to take attention away from GME. Believe it or not, but a global stock market can contain numerous trends all at once. The weed stocks rallied because of the belief that broader cannabis legalization is possible in the next 12-18 months under a Biden administration. Remember: the U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill decriminalizing cannabis last December, only for that legislation to die in the Senate, still controlled by the GOP. Now that Dems have control of the White House and both chambers of Congress, cannabis has a much more clear and easy path towards legalization. Obviously that would be enormous for the marijuana industry, so people are grabbing shares now, ahead of the potential explosion in growth. Also, a lot of these stocks were shorted and are now getting squeezed. None of this has anything to do with GME._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Been bagholding in the Weed sector for 2+ years...üíéüëêüèº made those bags a little lighter this week! _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ 4:20pm APHA Gains Update: +$52K / 410% ROI _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Note on weed stocks - UK regulatory changes One thing that may have slipped un-noticed is that late 2020 the UKGov relaxed some of its conditions around which companies can float on the LSE that have connections to weed. Historically the thing that stopped it being possible is the proceeds of crime act. Today MCG pharma floated who are a medicinal marijuana company. As a resident of the UK I feel there is going to be a big media and public push for rapid legalisation soon as it is a full no-brainier and I know nobody who is vehemently against it.

They have clearly started to look at this in Westminster and given the Tories progressive agenda coupled with a need for new industries to grow I think that looking at companies with Uk access is a great start. With Brexit done and Canada‚Äôs commonwealth links I can see big opportunities on the horizon for certain Canadian weed conglomerates.

#Major competitor

The current competition is IDEXX Laboratories (NASDAQ: $IDXX).

#News and upcoming catalysts

Zomedica had 2 fantastic weeks, it's price is rising since they announced truforma will be launched at the end of March.

&nbsp;
When the stock price was at almost $3 they announced a *BOUGHT DEAL* to rise 173.5 millions dollars at $1.90 per share. Surprisingly this happened just 2 days ago and the price already recovered and is now around $2.55 per share.

&nbsp;
Zomedica announced that the money will be used to speed up the research and launch of new products.

&nbsp;
 As of today Zomedica is **DEBT FREE**

&nbsp;
The upcoming financial annual report that will be published at the end of this month, the announcement of a new big potential investor who bought the offered shares, and certain news about Truforma when close to launch could really trigger an unprecedented rise of this stock.

&nbsp;
By investing today you could easily have a share worth up to $8 on product launch, or even double digits when they'll be announcing new incoming products and patents. This is a stock that has common sudden bull runs and a community of retailers who are expecting to hold their shares for years.

Baidu Inc. (BIDU) has partnered with BB to use the QNX software in their vehicles. If Blackberry plays its cards right, the QNX software could be used in a multitude of different things. They could implement the QNX software into multiple car makes and models, and even use the software in other types of vehicles outside of just automobiles.

On the other hand, BB's QNX software could crumble if it is not competitive and there are better options for car manufacturers.

So what is everyone's opinion on BB? Why should you invest in them, and/or why shouldn't you invest in them? I am still doing my research and would love to talk about this.

EDIT: BB is also very strong in cybersecurity. 9/10 of the worlds largest banks use BB security software to secure data. _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ We are not in a bubble.

&#x200B;

Hi all, NrdRage here.  You might remember me from such hits as "pegging $GME dead right multiple times during its bubble, making everybody rich on $RIOT, exposing the $PLUG infinite money glitch, accidentally helping start the $BB craze, never getting an $AMD weekly call right and being in an abusive relationship with the VIX" or maybe "The SEC and you:  How you can just say no to having them shove a Mister Fister up your ass".  Alright, apes, it's been a great few days being able to throw a dart at a wall of weed stocks and no matter where it sticks, you make money.  It's been a great run.  But if you're going to expand the acreage of your jungle and the amount of lady gorillas you earn the right to mate with, you gotta start thinking a bit.  And that means - hear me out - thinking of how the hell you plan on getting out of SNDL alive.  And yes, I realize I'm saying this right after it spiked almost a hundo percent in the last 24 hours.  Look, I was playing it, too.  I grabbed some 2/19 3c's and a shit ton of 1/22 1.5c's on Tuesday.  I also got out of both of those today, though not as high up as I could have.  If you check my history, you'll see I even said I was goingt to eye a re-entry.  Then the market took a giant dump and gave me that entry, but I passed on it because I had done some research by that point.  Whatever, profit's profit.

&#x200B;

Here's the TL:DR:  It's basically a penny stock that's gotten pumped to hell.  But the smart ape realizes when something has gone too mainstream and gets out of the way before the bulldozers wipe out his trees.

&#x200B;

Hey, I love shoving a share price around a bit as much as the next guy, I ain't gonna talk shit about that.  But it seems like nobody has an exit strategy for this, and I'm starting to see a lot of really stupid shit about Holding to 42.69 and all the other ridiculous bullshit from people who clearly don't even know what they fuck they've invested in that the GME Gibbons fell for.

&#x200B;

# Here's the reality of SNDL:

&#x200B;

The company was on the verge of bankruptcy around Thanksgiving, they have no other markets other than Canada, which is ridiculously oversaturated with weed to the point that wholesale prices are less than a dollar a gram.  And they recently got forced to admit that their product fails to meet THC content requirements.

&#x200B;

In case you're wondering what that means, it means they sell skunkweed that they cut with paper and sawdust to make it cheaper.  They sell garbage.  And everyone knows it - their brand is associated with low quality crap.

&#x200B;

Plus, they actively solicited us to buy their stock to drive up the price, then diluted it to fuck with a billion share offering.  Now, to their credit, this not only enabled them to become debt free, but also up their marketing budget and spend some time trying to create a brand.  Don't get too excited, fucking Sam's Choice at Wal-Mart is a brand, too, doesn't mean you should stick a chub of their ground beef up your rectum.  By reason of them selling skunkweed, their margins lag well behind that of their competitors.

&#x200B;

Looking at their financials, they've got 615 million in cash laying around.  That's pretty good - except  they're a company that burns 250 million a quarter.  Which means they're going to dilute the fuck out of everyone again next month.  They've got no exposure to the US market, but had no problem dropping "rumors" that they were going to break in to the US market through licensing deals - which turned out to be 1 pot shop in Bellingham, Washington.  They have no real expansion plan anywhere in the world, for that matter.

&#x200B;

# B...bu.....bu.bu....BUT NRDRAGE!  Stonk go up !  Look at it!  SNDL to the moon!  üöÄ  üöÄ  üöÄ ).

&#x200B;

Yeah, I know.  It's fucking crazy to talk shit about a stock when it's seemingly mid flight.  But here I am anyways.  Not to talk you out of the weed party - you should totally keep playing that for all it's worth - but rather to get people to see that they've probably outgrown skunkweed now.

&#x200B;

Look, the reason this thing mooned is because it was like a dollar.  Hell, it was 13 cents not too far back.  With a stock worth a dollar, it's easy to get a lot of other apes to throw a couple of bananas at it for the lulz.  It's easy to shove around a penny stock with an extra 10 bucks you have laying around from another trade somewhere.  But as the price goes up, so too goes up the perceived cost of entering.  I can make a strong (unassailable, in fact), argument that $APHA at $25 is cheaper than SNDL at 3.25.  But people are conditioned to like smaller numbers.  Unfortunately, as the GME Gibbons learned, eventually you run out of buyers, and then things go tits up real fast.

&#x200B;

As the Prophet Biggie Smalls once said, Mo' Money Equals Mo' Problems.  We all know this equation to be true.  And here you are, sitting on bags of bananas you didn't know you were gonna have a week ago thanks to some stonk you hadn't heard of before yesterday.  You don't think you've got a problem, but you do.  Because those bags of bananas aren't edible until you turn them in to the bank for real cash.  If you're sitting on  bananas from the gold standard of the weed world (that would be, $TLRY), you're resting pretty easy that no other ape is gonna come by and steal your bananas.  There are gonna be lots of bananas to go around, and mostly we're just taking bananas from fools who think their bananas will be less later.  But you don't have that with SNDL.  All the bananas are currently sitting with people who think the bananas will go higher.  You can't all be right, especially when there are billions of bananas, and now your grandparents are starting to buy bananas because some Boomer on CNBC told them it would make their dick bigger and their friends think they were cooler.

&#x200B;

# Again, I'm not telling you to leave the party

&#x200B;

But, if you recall your dorm room years, the best pizza you could afford was the Tony's school lunchroom style shit for a dollar.  Then you managed to  hide a few bucks from the people who collect your student loans, and you upgraded to Domino's.  Maybe by now you're ordering from a local joint that makes it's own dough in house and the sauce is made with the love of an old Italian grandma who accidentally dips her sagging tiddies into the pot 3 times while making it.  That just makes it taste better.  That's science.  But I digress.

&#x200B;

The point is, you can get better weed now.  You don't have to smoke the skunk.  So before you get the rug pulled out from beneath you and are stuck investing in shitty penny stocks again, maybe you should elevate your enterprise.  Let's take a look at your options:

&#x200B;

# Canopy Growth

You could go with $CGC.  They not only sell higher quality weed, but are an established brand and also sell oils and shit to those hippie fucks who still think Burning Man isn't just a brogrammer beatfest and go to an acupuncturist to enhance their "luck".  They've captured that all important 65+ stoner demographic by marketing their shit as a cure for seizures, cataracts, and dry vag, so they've got a lot of revenue.  They've also had a much more muted rise this week because they just haven't been on everybody's lips, which means they've got a lot of room to run.  The downside here is they burn almost as much cash as SNDL, but they've also got more bullets.

&#x200B;

# Aurora

If you go with $ACB, you're going with a company that's already gone through its "shady as fuck" stage and has re-emerged healthy from it.  You're also not only getting on weed, but the DIY urban chicken farmer types who want to grow their own weed.  They, too, have had a strong run, but have a lot more runway than most because they've actually got a really strong path to dominance in the US market once it opens up to them.

&#x200B;

# Organigram:

&#x200B;

Look, if your dick is still getting hard at the thought of playing a low dollar stonk or you've only got 28 dollars to invest, you could do a lot worse.  They've got strong branding, large growth potential, a management structure that doesn't seem to act shady, and they've run almost as well as the other new generation of meme stonks, but lagged back enough because nobody can fucking rmeember their name to where they can rubber band a bit.

&#x200B;

# Tilray and Aphria:

&#x200B;

I'm combining these because they're inexorably joined at the hip (or should be, more on that later) because the two of them are merging.  For those who don't know, sometime in Q2, every share of $APHA you own will turn into .833 shares of $TLRY.  Even though APHA is the one buying out TLRY.    This is basically the gold standard of weed stonkery.  When you start investing in these, you know you're a real investor.

&#x200B;

Here's the interesting thing with these guys, though.  Even though APHIA should be just slightly trailing behind TLRY in terms of stock price, it's currently trading at less than half.  With TLRY sitting at 73 a share as I write this, APHA should be at just over $60.  But it's at 29.  Now, obviously, this means that TLRY has a lot more momentum, and some of that is due to the fact that there's a mini (don't flog me for using the word, but it's true) short squeeze going on with that one, which has turned it into such a strong momentum play.  But APHA, by virtue of actual math, needs to be within about 17% of TLRY's price.  Which means APHA either needs to moon dramatically, or TLRY needs to fall precipitously.  Now either of those things could happen, but the momentum of TLRY is hard to stop, which means it's more likely that APHA rubber bands to catch up to it in the coming months.  Even if TLRY does falter, that means APHA still has to come up a bit to meet it.  Making APHA kind of a "can't go tits up" situation.  TLRY also has the benefit of having enough market cap to where fund bois will buy into it, whereas SNDL is too small to meet most of their requirements.    Which can further propel TLRY (and thus, drag APHA with it).

&#x200B;

One of the interesting things that's been happening with this pair is that the order books, even though they should mirror one another, have completely inverted from one another numerous times in the last couple of days.  This, of course, was a bull flag for TLRY every time it happened, leaving APHA to compensate to try and catch back up shortly thereafter.  It's really easy money.

&#x200B;

Fundamentally, these guys have one HUUUUUUUGE advantage over the others:  They secured the UK distribution, and now have the inside track to be the supplier for the rest of the Europoors across the pond who need to smoke a bond to help forget all the things wrong with them.  And if you don't think they won't be able to leverage that to be the front runners out of the gate when the US opens for business, then you definitely ain't black.

&#x200B;

# Or, you can just stay where you are and do the  üíéüëê thing

&#x200B;

Ask the $GME Gibbons how well that worked out for them.  The ones still holding that stonk are like that one dude sitting at the edge of the bar of the Viper Room, still rocking his mullet and chain wallet, just convinced that Warrant and Slaughter are going to ring in the glory days of hair metal once more and that Queensryche is going to start selling out stadiums again.  It's just sad.  You're flying right now, but a rug is gonna get pulled out from under you and then you're gonna have your own daily thread where you reassure yourselves that it's gonna be OK and that you're gonna ride it to a thousand one day.  Lots of us (myself included) made a fuck ton of money on GME.  And we've made a fuck ton on SNDL and the rest of the Weedies this week.  But there are always people who Melvin it and hang on to their position too long and get stuck.  That's gonna be a lot of you, but you shouldn't let it be you.

&#x200B;

# TL:DR:  Smart apes should look at their much bigger pile of bananas from SNDL while you're way ahead and upgrade them to plantains before the other apes.  Plaintains equals breeding with better apes, not low quality apes that cannibalize fellow apes and give ape diseases.

I will be going in HEAVY on this one. 

Reasons being:

1) Covid. The amount of single people right now outweigh people in relationships (loser lost of you autists fucking your hand) 
2) GME AMC and all that brought an entire new species of people to be trading. 
3) A lot of the new traders are looking to make back their bucks from GME AMC etc
4) People can relate to and with Bumble. All of them are on it or using it to get laid so therefore I think it will have a ton of people interested. 

Hopefully there will be options availabe.

Moving forward, I think I'll start posting HIMX stuff weekly instead of daily, and post it as a DISCUSSION.

  

My thoughts on HIMX have not changed.  I still think it's still in a major upcycle - with some possible pullbacks and consolidation, which is a good thing.  Allows folks the chance to get some who didn't have the opportunity before.
