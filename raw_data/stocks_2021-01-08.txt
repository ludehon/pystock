Northland Power Inc Northland Power Inc. is a utility company based in Toronto, Canada but maintains an international presence in its operations. My original rationale for the company is that it provided a unique opportunity because of its relative safety of being a utility with lots of upward potentials. At the time of my consideration, they had not quite finished their Deutsche Bucht offshore wind farm, and valued at \~$27/share. Now valued at \~$50/share I'm up 90%. The yield I get on dividends is 4%.  


What I'm curious about is how do people decide when to sell? I'm a value investor by strategy. I bought the company at a bargain and now believe them to be overvalued. They represent 23% of my portfolio. My original plan was to sell at $60 or 5-years (2025). But, their recent, rapid run-up is making me reconsider.

Some findings:

39.77% of Tesla is held by institutional investors. This places it #43 out of 50, and #42 out of 44 out of American companies. The only American companies on the top 50 with a lower percentage of itself owned by institutional investors are Wal-Mart and Berkshire Hathaway Class A shares.

The overall average is 61.57%. For the United States, it's slightly higher at 67.36%, and for international companies, of which there are only 7, the average is much lower at 19.16%.

The lowest is Toyota, with only 1.11% owned by institutional investors. The highest is Visa, with 92.76%.

Thanks!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ What’s your experience with Trading212 ? Hi all,

since I am in Europe (Germany) and can’t invest in the ARKK etf, I was looking for a way to recreate the ETF. My broker doesn’t have it and it‘s not accessible in Europe in general. Doing this manually will cost me too much money for every single transaction every single month (I want to invest monthly). Therefore I was looking for alternatives.

Found out that Trading212 has this amazing function called „Basked“. You can basically create your own basket with stocks ans adjust their weight. 7% Tesla, 6% Square, 5% Invitae etc. And you can automate the monthly investment rate and just set it and forget it. The fees are close to 0€ per transaction. Since I‘m putting just a little amount of money monthly, I‘m buying fractions of the shares every month. I couldn’t find any other broker who offers this.

Everything is perfect. They are based in the UK and Bulgaria (non-EU and EU).

My only concern is that Trading212 is still very young as a broker and don’t know how trustworthy it is going to be in the long run. For example, they don’t handle the taxes, compared to a traditional broker. You have to do it yourself, based on the country you live in, which could be tricky.

And also I don’t really know what would happen if they go bankrupt. I am supposed to be the beneficial owner of the shares I bought, but no idea how that‘d work with fractional shares. Or what will happen if they suddenly forbid them in Germany?

So, does anybody have experience with them?

Last November, President Donald Trump issued an executive order that barred American citizens from purchasing shares of U.S.-listed Chinese companies with alleged ties to the Chinese military after Jan. 11. Selling existing positions in those securities would be permitted until Nov. 11. All three telcos were included on that list.

On New Year's Eve, the New York Stock Exchange announced it would suspend trading in all three companies from Jan. 7 to Jan. 11 and start the delisting process. The announcement caused all three stocks to tumble.

But on Jan. 4, the NYSE abruptly reversed that decision and said it wouldn't delist the three telcos -- and then just two days later, it flipped its position again and said the delistings would proceed.

Shortly afterward, many brokerages notified investors that all trading in the three stocks would be restricted on Jan. 8 and that any position that wasn't closed would remain locked until the restrictions were lifted. As of this writing, it isn't clear if investors can still sell their shares after Jan. 8.*

Peace out! :)_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ STCN - Micro-cap with activists involved Steel Connect (STCN, $0.80) is an under-followed, small-cap activist special situation that is worth at least $3.00-4.00 per share. STCN trades at an 18% earnings yield and a 121% free cash flow yield with consolidated returns on tangible capital of 74% and $2.00-3.00 per share of hidden value in its $2.1 billion of NOLs. The company is in play after large shareholder Steel Partners (SPLP) has proposed buying the 62% of shares it doesn’t already own. We believe the stock has:

Attractive upside in a stand-alone Base Case ($8.70-11.33 per share) with continued EBITDA improvement ($90-110 million in FY21 from $87mm in FY20) and $40-50 million free cash flow used to pay down debt. Applying a reasonable peer multiple of 7.0-8.0x EV/EBITDA, and including value of $2.00-3.00 per share for the company’s $2.1 billion in NOLs.

Significant upside in a strategic alternatives, sum-of-the-parts Upside Case ($10.25-15.32 per share) where either or both core businesses are sold for 7-8x and tax-free proceeds are used to pay special dividend or repurchase shares at significant discount to NAV, with a consistent $2.00-3.00 per share value for the company’s NOLs. A new 49% shareholder could acquire shares or drop in a high taxable income business, given massive NOLs and expiration of 3-year Section 382 window on December 18, 2020.

Minimal downside based on 1.) Steel Partners’ (SPLP) November 19, 2020 proposal to buy the 62% of shares it doesn’t already own (39mm shares), 2.) historical take-out premiums SPLP has paid for tuck-ins of \~40-55% on last 52 week average share price 3.) along with $60 million of free cash flow in FY2020 on its $50mm market cap (121% FCF yield) and its current undervaluation of 3-4x EV/EBITDA vs peers at 7-10x. SPLP, with a cost basis of near $4.00 per share, is highly incentivized to combine STCN to maximize the value of its NOLs. SPLP has just recently accelerated share repurchases, announced the sale and $220mm gain on Aerojet Rocketdyne (AJRD) and is selling its $25mm stake in Aviat Networks (AVNW) – all to simplify its corporate structure. SPLP last open market purchases were January 2015 at $3.75 per share!

Activist shareholder base including GAMCO Investors, Kennedy Capital, Solas and other unnamed large holders are unlikely to accept a proposal under $3.00-4.00 per share (5.8-6.5x ’20A including NOL value). See Steel Excel (SXCL) proxy where SPLP raised their offer 42%, which translates to $3.66 per STCN share (6.2x ’20A), after receiving two activist letters from GAMCO. Also see SPLP / Handy & Harman (HNH) lawsuit and $30mm settlement as well as pending STCN class action for egregious and dilutive convertible issuances and insider share grants for 29.7mm shares or 34.3% of the company! 70% of minority shareholders voted against this dilution at the July 2018 Annual Meeting and they will likely vote down a take-under._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Lockheed Martin - worth investing?

Just looking at the charts, it's plainly a large defense company laggard. No significant news coming out of the defense department lately - which is overall a good thing for the world, imo. However, that leaves opportunity to make money on the stock when the news does come.  

I could write a long winded DD about Space Force, growing tensions with China and the issues the US has with their growing military, the Russian hacks, etc. But, I'm lazy and I think the price targets, TA, and life experience are good enough for me.

MGM made some recent acquisitions over the summer and it went largely unnoticed due to focus on other areas of the market like airlines, EV, etc. This has led MGM to have a current stock price of 31$ a share and a fair value topping 100$. If this isn't enough, MGM is positioned to gain from the rising sports betting market arguably more than any other company listed. My recommendation is buy leaps to take full advantage of the positive correction that should come between now and 2022. Personally I bought Jan 2022 50$ strike options last week. So far I'm only up 25%, I plan to sell around 1000% gains. If it fully corrects to it's fair value I'd make much more than that._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Amazon Stock Split?

What would you suggest for someone with patience?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Apple Stocks App Incorrect? Hi all, 

I hope this is the right place to ask this question, I couldn’t find anything searching online. 

I use the Apple Stocks app for a quick glance at pricing throughout the day and I’m hoping I’m just reading it incorrectly, but there appears to be a discrepancy between the states stock price and increase/decrease for the day, and the actual chart.

For example, at the time of posting, the S&P500 is showing a price of 3810.77, which is stated as a gain of 0.18%. However, the chart shows the open price as 3821.10 meaning the price has actually decreased by around 0.28% today, if my calculation is accurate. Anyone else notice this issue?

I suppose the issue could be that I’m incorrect in assuming the price and performance stated is from the open today - maybe it’s shown over a different time period? 

As I say, I’m probably just misreading the app._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Stocks have been rising like there’s no toworrow all over the world, while major sectors of the economy is producing little output.

Lately I have been thinking what the new Apple or Tesla could be.

An Iphone and Tesla were also product considerd luxury products but in America it was already sort of "normal" to use these products.

Thanks for the awards._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Why is FDX down 20% over the last month? Hi everyone. First time posting in r/stocks! I'm making this post because I don't see too many people talking about this (probably) amazing buying opportunity.   

I've been tracking $FDX ever since they beat earnings on 18th December - the stock was trading at 302$ and today it's down to almost 245$ (-20%). I believe it's a solid company that consistently beats estimates and that 2021 will probably see more packages being delivered than 2020 (owing to a significant rise in lockdowns and covid-19 cases). So what I don't understand is: **What's the bearish case here? Why is this stock taking so hard?**

Furthermore, $FDX has a [356$ price target by Goldman Sachs](https://www.modernreaders.com/news/2020/12/31/fedex-nysefdx-given-a-356-00-price-target-by-the-goldman-sachs-group-analysts.html) and a [368$ target by Credit Suisse](https://www.modernreaders.com/news/2020/12/28/fedex-nysefdx-given-a-368-00-price-target-at-credit-suisse-group.html).

TPC recently took off but seems to still be valued pretty low at under 8x forward PE and 0.4x price to book value. I don’t own any shares, but wondering if now is a good time to buy them or other construction companies?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Google, one of the biggest tech companies is running a scam. Their GOOG stock is a Pyramid scheme. GOOG is a C class stock without voting rights and it doesn’t pay dividends, and they said that they will not pay them in the future. The company explicitly said in its 2017 annual filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that "we intend to retain any future earnings and do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future." Google states the "par value” (the amount Google owes you for the stock) of each GOOG stock is 0.001$ US Dollars. Yet each stock is sold at 1700$ in the stock market.

Why does one buy a GOOG stock? To make money. But since GOOG doesn’t pay dividends, the only way to make money is by selling it to other investor at a higher price. But that investor is buying that stock from him, to also make money, by selling it to others at a higher price. And if everyone is buying GOOG stock to sell it to someone else at a higher price, then what real value GOOG stocks have?

If you come to Alphabet inc and show them your 1700$ stock and told them to repay it, they will pay you 0.001$ US Dollars.

So the only way you can make money, is by taking money generated by new investors.

Definition of a Ponzi Scheme: “A Ponzi scheme is a fraudulent investing scam which generates returns for earlier investors with money taken from later investors. Ponzi schemes eventually bottom out when the flood of new investors dries up and there isn't enough money to go around. At that point, the schemes unravel.” So if GOOG is a ponzi scheme, when do investors dry up and the scheme is unraveled like other Ponzi schemes? The unraveling gets hidden, because It is masked as a bubble burst.

When the new investors stop buying stocks, last investors holding that stock cannot sell them at a higher price and the price of the stock crushes, we call it a bubble burst.

If GOOG doesn’t give any money to its investors, and only source of money for investors are new investors, than it’s a zero sum game. Like a gambling game with other people, but with fees attached to be able to play at a casino, in this case Google.

But it isn’t advertised as a gambling, GOOG is advertised as an investment by Alphabet, making clueless investors buy GOOG stocks, not knowing that its just a zero sum gambling. This is at the edge of criminality. I don’t even know how is it legal.

The simple truth is, GOOG is a Ponzi scheme, being advertised as an investment, when in reality it’s a zero-sum gambling game where the winners are those who sell them first before others, and if everyone knew that it was a zero sum gambling, GOOG stock price would crush right now and no one would want to buy it anymore. This is outrageous.

I thought that other companies such as ERIC and NOK would naturally benefit from the souring of relations with China / Chinese companies and the ever-increasing 5g rollout. ERIC has been doing good however it appears that NOK may be so behind in the race that they cannot capitalize on the ban of Huawei and may take years to catch up to the competitors. The CEO of NOK stated as much in their outlook of 2021 with a focus on restructuring. I just don't see them having that time to make up without competitors capturing most of the market share. I'm thinking I misread the NOK play and should have went harder on ERIC. My timeline for selling these shares is end of 2021 or 2022. Thoughts?

My aim is to find the sweet spot of probability, profitability and duration per trade. I understand market conditions do change this but it does raise an interesting argument.

I take profit as 50% off at 10%, 40% off at 15% and leave 10% to run. Some runners can gain 50% others hit 0% and SL. These 50% runners need a duration of usefulness, as it sat there for 1/2months is capital not being utilised. 

I want to ensure capital is turned over efficiently into the next trade by cutting winners at an effective point and losers too. Also if 10/15/runner is the most effective

My W/L average has been increasing month on month, 73% Win rate over 6 months. 

So understanding this, I need: 
The average duration of trade to each profit
The probability of achieving each percentage
The duration to each percentage
Variable inclusion of Market direction per trade giving a factor of error. 

I would hope this would find a sweet spot for example : say 8% profit is normally found in 4 days, whilst 12% takes 10 days, but has a probability of 90%. 
10%/15% profit target would take 7 and 20 days, probability of 73%. 
Therefore compounded the smaller consistent gains on a shorter time frame are more effective.

> # 1. Wall Street set to continue its record run

> U.S. stock futures rose Friday, one day after the Nasdaq closed at a record high. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 also closed Thursday at records. Both benchmarks were tracking for weekly gains despite Monday’s sharp drops, the first negative starts to a new year since 2016. The Nasdaq was also solidly higher for the week as Wall Street powered higher over the past two days despite Wednesday’s deadly siege at the U.S. Capitol and its fallout.

The world’s largest cryptocurrency has been up more than 30% in the first days of 2021 and 400% over the past 12 months. The value of the entire crypto market, which is made up of bitcoin and other digital coins, topped $1 trillion Thursday for the first time.

> Tesla shares marched higher in Friday’s premarket after rising 10 sessions in a row, surpassing Facebook in market value, and making CEO Elon Musk the world’s richest person. Thursday’s increase in Tesla’s share price pushed Musk past Amazon’s Jeff Bezos, who had been the richest person since 2017.

> # 2. December jobs report could be weaker than forecast

> The pace of job growth likely slowed dramatically and could even be negative in December, as the coronavirus spread rapidly across the U.S. Economists expect to see a gain of 50,000 jobs, down from 245,000 nonfarm payrolls additions in November. The Labor Department’s monthly employment report is out at 8:30 a.m. ET, and the stock market could react more to a positive surprise than a negative one. The 10-year Treasury yield remained above 1% early Friday ahead of that report.

> # 3. Trump finally concedes Biden will become president

> President Donald Trump late Thursday admitted — for the first time in his own words, despite vowing never to concede — that a “new administration will be inaugurated” on Jan. 20. In a nearly three-minute video, posted after his Twitter lockout ended, Trump did not mention President-elect Joe Biden by name. It came a day after the outgoing president sparked the riot that saw a mob breach the U.S. Capitol in protest of the election.

> # 4. Pelosi, Schumer call for Trump removal from office

> Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi are calling for Trump’s removal, accusing him of inciting “insurrection.” Schumer said that if Vice President Mike Pence and the Cabinet do not move to invoke the 25th Amendment, Congress should reconvene to impeach Trump.

> Pelosi said Congress “may be prepared” to impeach Trump if executive branch officials do not act.

> Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo were among the Cabinet secretaries who discussed the possibility of invoking the 25th Amendment to remove Trump, three sources told CNBC. They determined the process of elevating Pence to the presidency could take more than a week, diluting its effects.

> # 5. Single-day Covid deaths top 4,000 for first time

> The U.S. had its first day of over 4,000 deaths from Covid-19. In the single worst day of the pandemic Thursday, 4,085 people died from the virus. The latest coronavirus surge iaw record seven-day averages of new daily infections and deaths running at 228,497 and 2,764, respectively. As of Thursday, the number of people hospitalized with Covid fell slightly from Wednesday’s record high levels.

> A coronavirus vaccine developed by U.S.-based Pfizer and Germany’s BioNTech appears to be effective against a key mutation in the more infectious variants of the coronavirus discovered in the U.K. and South Africa. The research by Pfizer has not been peer reviewed. The World Health Organization said last month that health authorities were “urgently investigating” whether the virus mutation affects vaccine performance.

Is there any way to stop these damn annoying things? I day trade, often buying and/or selling multiple stocks and/or index funds each day. I do not care in the slightest when they have "confirmed" that my request to buy $400 worth of Raytheon went through. It already shows up in my holdings. I see it there.

As far as I can tell, they consider these "account service" notifications and refuse to allow me to deactivate them. It's annoying as hell. I literally get five of them in a day sometimes. I'm apparently going to have to change my email with Merrill and block them from communicating with me at all, which I prefer not to do because I don't know when they might have to contact me about something actually important._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Stock Market News for Today | TSLA vs FB | LMND SPIKES | APPLE CAR & other stock market news [01-08] **Stocks finish at all-time highs as Tesla passes Facebook in market value. Lemonade rises by more than 20% again while reports continue to come in on the Apple Car. Let’s talk about this and other stock market news**

**\~Very Long Post\~**

Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let’s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw a big rally in the stock market after the [Biden](https://ibb.co/QpPkkvg) confirmation and Trump called for a smooth transition with the tech heavy [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/sw8bKdb) recovering the previous day losses and closing at over 13K. We also saw the broad stock market [SP500](https://ibb.co/MnjT8BH) gaining almost 1.5% and finishing over 3800 while the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/ykPckZD) also posted a gain of over 200 points to close at just over 31k with all 3 of the big indexes finishing at new records. This broad rally pushed the [VIX](https://ibb.co/5MY0P1w) down, as the volatility index finished the day lower by more than 10% as 9 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/nmc7x8X) finished in the Green with Technology leading the way up 2.7%, while Utilities was the biggest laggard dropping by 1.3%.

Growth companies largely outperformed [yesterday](https://ibb.co/XpHGdhb) with both small and large cap growth companies posting big gains across the board, while value plays lagged behind, as 2/3 of the companies were advancing [YESTERDAY](https://ibb.co/NLLMyLY) with over 300 new highs on average volume.

So, let’ take a look at the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/ys6zg6M) from yesterday, as big tech companies flourished with the likes of Apple, Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Nvidia, Tesla and many more posting gains at least 2%, while most of the losses were concentrated in the Chinese stocks that are being delisted and the more value heavy utilities sector.

Yesterday we also received the investor sentiment [SURVEY](https://ibb.co/10gRPgn), which saw a worrying move in the stock market, as bullish investors surpassed 50% of the total investors and is near the 1-year high from November. Most of this move to the bullish side came from neutral investors, which are way below the historical [average](https://ibb.co/XbyKxjB), which probably decided to get back in the market, rushing in the clean energy sector, the industrials and many others after the Democrats swept the Georgia election. I remind you that I usually use this survey as a contrarian indicator, when sentiment moves to this much greed in the market, I usually don’t like to add to my positions, as I await to buy stocks on red days.

We also received some economic data yesterday, as we saw December’s homes for [SALE](https://ibb.co/7Y3njz3) fall to an all-time low, below 700K as the housing market keeps on booming, with homes selling faster by about 2 weeks compared to last year while the national inventory dropped by almost 40% since last year, as the median listing price was $340K, up over 13% since 2019.

[Today](https://ibb.co/t4bS0wH) is a quieter economic day, with the biggest number coming in the early morning as we wait to see the non-farm payrolls.

In some other stock market news, we saw [Nikola](https://ibb.co/DLP8f1P) joining the broad rally in the EV [STOCKS](https://ibb.co/mJgVqwr) yesterday which pushed almost every single stock higher, while we also saw a report from JP Morgan on some possible good developments on their trucks. I don’t believe in this company, it’s bad history, bad management and reputation will hurt it in the long even if they manage to develop a decent product, which is still to be seen, as they haven’t really brought anything innovative to the market.

One other stock that rose yesterday was [Lemonade](https://ibb.co/FbZZ5Lz), as the stock spiked more than 27% yesterday, after the company was pitched by the Motley Fool yet again. I really like this company, and I think it has major disruption potential in the insurance world, so I agree with this report. The stock did suffer a slight pullback about a week ago after a report from The Friendly Bear but I don’t believe it will have a long-lasting effect, as I believe this stock has great growth potential.

[Apple](https://ibb.co/Xzscpk6) also seems to be confirming the previous reports and is in talks with Hyundai about a development of a self-driving EV, as we heard something about this from Hyundai before some confusion made them kind of back out of the previous statement. This report is pretty much as anticipated, as Apple would probably be looking to either collaborate on manufacturing with a traditional car manufacturer or actually just acquiring pretty much any one of them.

We also saw [Snowflake](https://ibb.co/vZ1v7yw) regain some momentum yesterday, rising by more than 13% despite the expiration period of another 38M shares. The latest IPOs and small-cap stocks have recently been able to raise a lot of capital as investors seem to be grabbing any share available at almost any price regarding valuations. This is a very dangerous thing yet again. This kind of stuff was happening in the last dot com bubble, though… I don’t really expect anything like that to happen with the overall stock market, but I think we might see some stocks have a big crash when valuations start to come back in the mind of investors.

Meanwhile we saw 2 big milestones for Tesla & Elon Musk yesterday as the company [passed](https://ibb.co/yXnFsbp) Facebook as market value goes as Tesla is seeing huge trading volumes as yesterday, it [traded](https://ibb.co/6BYkLP9) more shares than the next 3 big movers Apple, Alibaba and Amazon, while Elon Musk [became](https://ibb.co/xS0G5Sk) the richest man in the world, on the back of a 16% increase in Tesla stock already in 2021.

And two last pieces of good news are that the it’s expected the [FED](https://ibb.co/6FTNrSF) will likely hold rates near zero until 2024 while [Pfizer's](https://ibb.co/6nGSdWR) vaccine seems to be working as expected on multiple mutations, especially the latest highly transmissible one.

So, let’s hope for a good day as the European [markets](https://ibb.co/LdhPq9P) and the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/wSTgstr) are up to start off the day, with the Nasdaq Leading the way up over half a percent.

1. MX shipped \~150-160mm OLED DDICs (display drivers or display driver integrated circuits) in 2019 (\~avg. $1.75 each) = $267mm of OLED '19 rev. (source: IR presentation historical units chart). As a backdrop, MX makes the thinnest and most power efficient display drivers that control OLED screens which are increasingly being used, especially in power hungry 5G phones. MX customers are the OLED panel makers (like Samsung, LG, etc.) which then supplies to smartphone vendors like Xiaomi, Oppo, Apple (though MX chips are not used by AAPL), etc.
2. Q4 '20 revenue expectations are $132mm (from Yahoo finance).
3. At a 10% annual growth rate from 2019 = $294mm OLED '20 revenue. YTD Q3 '20 OLED revenue is $204mm -> then Q4 '20 OLED revenue would be $90mm. Add in $9mm for Foundry services and $45mm for power = $144mm >>> $132m expected  [Side by side comparison of MX OLED revenue compared to overall smartphone OLED panel revenue.](https://twitter.com/ShortsHoward/status/1347383813899358208/photo/1)
4. Other suppliers of DDIC space are also expecting record profits, from Digitimes Jan 7, 2020: "Novatek to lead new wave of price hikes for DDI, TDDI chips: Taiwan's leading display driver IC (DDI) vendor Novatek Microelectronics is expected to take the lead to raise its quotes soon to reflect increased foundry costs, which may send its revenues, gross margins and net earnings hitting new highs in first-quarter 2021, according to industry sources."
5. Synaptics, the #1 touch controller provider for OLED says they are seeing a very large growth market for OLED DDICs and are getting into this hot market in 2021 (CEO in last earnings call).

This company has not done so well historically but half their market cap is cash (4-5x EV/EBITDA) and leadership is doing more and more IR/consultations with western investors. MX just needs a 10% annual growth rate in overall OLED revenues for 2020. 

Given the HUGE OLED panel market projections for Q4 (50% YoY from Display Supply Chain Consultants [source](https://twitter.com/DSCCRoss/status/1338565644699230210/photo/1) ) and MX having \~50% more design wins in YTD Q3 '20 vs YTD Q3 '19, 10% YoY on OLED seems achievable._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Why hasn’t Pfizers stock price increased?

I am new to investing and was looking for some new opportunities outside of the standard market (which feels very overvalued). I see everyone is holdings things like Tesla, NIO, PLTR, Apple and all that, but those have had massive runs already.

This brings me to uranium and precious metals (now that I think about it, copper and even oil and gas have been doing well these last few months), but they have run up a lot and I am scared to jump in because it might just be a head fake.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

I figured it would impact the stock markets.

thanks_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ AMD - Pricing in the XLNX merger Bottom line up front: assuming the deal goes through at the stated timeline and price point, and using conservative estimates of both companies' growth trajectories, AMD will be trading at no less than $150/share by spring 2023, representing 24% gain per year for 2.5 years, using the January 7 closing price of $95.16. If its price multiples increase to fall within the range of NVDA, QCOM, QRVO, upside is $300 to $450 per share by mid-2023 (or higher, if you want to use a more aggressive growth trajectory). 

 \-------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are two assumptions in play that are by no means a done deal that are serving as the basis for my calculations. They are: 

1) They will complete the deal as planned by the end of 2021, meaning they will meet unspecified pre-conditions and receive regulator approval  
2) The all-stock purchase will be completed for the stated price of $35 billion. 

If those assumptions hold true, then the following is also true: 

The current fair market value for AMD stock, if XLNX's current market cap and outstanding shares are folded into the mix, is $100.96/share, based on today's XLNX price, or $101.14 based on the year-end $35 billion purchase price. The latter represents a 6.33% increase over the 7 January 2021 AMD closing price of $95.16/share. This is only based on up-to-date market cap figures and most-recent-quarter earnings figures, which are a good three months out of date at this point. 

Additionally, in the press releases and earnings calls where the CEOs discussed the merger, one of the points that came out was that the companies have a lot of overlap when it comes to their business operations and R&D. Within 18 months of the merger, or late spring 2023, that means they will be able to [cut $300 million in annual expenses](https://www.crn.com/slide-shows/components-peripherals/the-35b-amd-xilinx-acquisition-7-big-things-to-know/2), simply through synergy of eliminating functional overlap. Given the following from the most recent quarterly reports, covering 3 months of operations ending 26 Sep 2020: 

1) XLNX net earnings were $193.8m, or $775.2m annualized  
2) AMD net earnings were $390m, or $1.56b annualized  
3) Combined earnings are $2.33b

That means that net earnings will be increased by 13%, just in cutting overlapping expenses. That means that, assuming today's earnings and today's share prices, and combining the financials of both companies, the fair market value for AMD as of early- to mid-2023 is $114, based on annualized earnings numbers that are already three months old. 

Using conservative extrapolation of recent growth trajectories, and using today's price multiples\*, it's conservative to estimate that AMD will be trading for $150/share by June 2023. Based on the current share price of 95.12, that's an annualized growth of 23.96%. 

\*If for whatever reason there's a market downturn in this time, AMD's performance could live up to these numbers, but the price multiples could decrease. This represents nearly all remaining risk of inaccuracy, outside the stated assumptions.

Please fire away at this. Poke your holes and make your arguments. I'm getting ready to heavily shift my portfolio's center of gravity into AMD based on all this, so if any of you know a good reason not to, I'd love to hear it._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Holding short and long positions Hi all,

As the world population increases (projected growth = 8.5 billion by 2030), our only realistic option to have a sustainable world is the mass proliferation of green energy. Tesla and Nio are providing that solution, and that is why they have attracted so many investors. They are much more than car companies. They are green energy companies. Tesla and Nio will both grow beyond car manufacturing. They can/will make solar water heaters, solar roofs, homes, cars, trucks, bikes, trains, planes, and military vehicles.

EV companies are an important element of our future. Tesla is the leader. Nio is a good investment too. Nio already has a strong presence in Asia and its battery swap technology will boost Nio sales in the next years. Nio can now grow faster than Tesla did in its first ten years because China is in more need of green energy than never before. China’s current goal is to derive as much as 20% of its primary energy use from non-fossil fuels by 2030. Nio has too much growth potential in China. The demand for green energy will transform many EV companies into near trillion dollar companies.

Nio, Tesla, and other EV stocks will continue to be the best investments during the world's adoption of green energy.

Everyone and my bro in law have mentioned to max it out at 6k, but wasn't able to for last 2 years, so what happens if I don't max out but only put in $1.7k in 2019, and $4.7k in 2020?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Why do I have securities held in margin? Sorry in advance if this is a basic concept but I’m new to investing and I don’t understand. Every share I buy with money I transferred directly from my bank account. I thought margin is money borrowed from your brokerage. I’ve only been using money that I transferred from my checking so how is it that I have securities held in margin? Is it bad to have securities held in margin?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Best ETFs and/or stocks to hold for next 5-10 years? Sorry if it’s a question that is asked too frequently.

MP is the only company in the world that mines rare material, while the other 85% are controlled by China. This material is extremely important for many electrical devices, including Electric cars. 

So why isn't MP receiving contracts, when there is fear of China monopolizing very important material?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ App with IPO tracker for LSE and tailored stocks tracker Hi there! What is the best app(s) to use to:
1. Track IPOs on LSE - when they are coming out, what size, brief of company, etc
2. Track stocks with specific filters such as B2C, annual revenue threshold, HQ location, industry, etc? 

Thanks!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ IVR after split Obviously, as a very small investor, my DD may be incorrect and I'm all for being corrected.

IVR dropped, and hard, in early March. I believe it had something to do with a fear among the bigger investors that people would fall behind on their mortgage. Obviously, a lot of people did. But IVR held particularly different properties that, apparently, were very difficult to sell. 

Apparently they changed their strategy. With the coronavirus vaccine (and subsequent challenges from the new strains in cali and new york) and potential reopening of the economy (as president Biden said he wanted to do), foot traffic could increase. 

What do you think? What else do you feel we should know about this company? Should this be a buy and hold long term?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Would 10% of my portfolio in ARKG be too risky? I have a mostly ETF portfolio with a good mix of sectors and I already own ARKK and ARKW. Currently, ARKG makes up about 3% of my portfolio and after watching some interviews featuring Cathy Wood and reading about gene therapy I'm pretty convinced I should raise it to 10%

Would appreciate your assistance.

Example:

I sell my stock which yielded a profit within the year of buying it. I don’t cash out and don’t transfer to my bank, but reinvest immediately with the same firm. Am I subject to be taxed? 

Thank you much!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Question related to options and capital gains Is there any way to save on short term capital gains in the following scenario?  I sell a call at strike price $10 (and my initial purchase is averages $8 a share) and the strike price hits on or before expiration and option is exercised.  Do I save on taxes if  I sell a put at $10 with an expiration of 4 weeks (less than 30 days) and I exercise it and essentially buying it back?  Or am I always obligated to pay capital gains on the $2 I made per share?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ South Korea’s Hyundai Motor soars 18% after report of deal with Apple; Asia-Pacific stocks rise "Shares of automaker Hyundai Motor soared about 18% following a local media report of a deal between the firm and Cupertino-based tech giant Apple on developing electric vehicles and batteries. The report, however, added that the deal is still pending approval."

Seems to just be a rumor but Hyundai has also gone all in on fuel cells. They plan to test this year and start producing cars by 2025. SK group* just made a $1.5 billion dollars deal with PLUG too. They are also possibly building a fuel cell plant in china. 

What do you all think? Is Hyundai a competitor in the EV race?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Renewable Energy Any thoughts on which renewable energy the Biden administration would favor? Solar energy has always been popular but perhaps wind energy is a sleeper? Currently invested on renewable energy etfs so that I can be balanced._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Sell Tesla Cmon? A P.E. Ratio of 1600?

I know I’m going to get hate for saying this, but I think it’s the truth.

Is it really possible that Tesla is going to be such a huge part of the future that it’s worth 1600x it’s earnings?

I don’t see Tesla staying this high much longer. It’s completely saturated._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Does Tesla's valuation become more reasonable when you consider its not just an EV company? Obviously its current valuation is absurd, regardless of circumstances. It's rate of growth (in share price, not the material company) is ridiculous and based on inklings of news and hearsay. However I've seen lots of comparisons of Tesla to the rest of the auto industry, which I can't help feel (from a subjective, social science perspective), isn't totally adequate. Tesla is the industry leader in EV technology, sure, but it's arguably also poised to be a leader in home-solar/battery technology, and already is the leader in autonomous driving technology.

Those sectors are going to explode in the coming decade (not to mention Tesla makes some of the most innovative, cheapest, and aesthetically-pleasing solar panels on the market). With the Dems controlling both Houses and the Executive branch, subsidies and consumer incentives should pour in. Moreover, Tesla has surmounted many of the technological/logistical hurdles that their competitors haven't even faced yet.

Tesla is overvalued, but it's valuation is based on presumptive/specualtive growth in all those sectors, not EVs alone, which makes it slightly less ridiculous, especially as a long-term investment imo._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Where should I invest $1000? Based on how everything is going with the world around us I was wondering where would be the best place to invest $1000.

I whole heartedly thank you and holding it for atleast a few years._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ How shorting stock actually affects stock price I have watched some videos and read articles trying to figure this out exactly with no luck.

When one shorts a stock the "sell" that stock. But who exactly are they selling to? Is it always some other buyer that has an open order at that exact moment your order is filled?  If so, why does shorting cause an increase in supply which lowers the price? It would seem to me that since there is a buyer on the other side of the trade that the transaction would negate each other and the supply/demand would remain the same.

What am I missing in my understanding?

Could someone explain the dynamics of the various actors within this process? e.g. the Short seller, the buyer, a broker, etc?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Anyone else had a really great day today? I just wanna know if anyone else had an amazing green day today. Cause I am up 6% today(which is the highest I ever gotten)thanks to EV's and renewable stocks I own.

I think Apple’s car project represents a huge threat for Tesla. Right now they’re priced like they’ll be the only electric carmaker forever and for always, but it’s becoming obvious that’s not true._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ My Watchlist For 1/8/2021 \*\*I use the 180D/4H Chart. With the RSI, Stochastic, Vortex, and 10-50-200EMA lines.\*\*

&#x200B;

$AUPH - Fantastic price action and area of value. I wish it had some higher highs, but that is okay for now. RSI is oversold and Vortex is very low, I can see it reversing.

&#x200B;

$DOC - Another great value and channel here. Showing long term higher lows which is great. All indicators are oversold, so reversal likely.

&#x200B;

$GIS - Not some big winner, but a great setup. Could be an easy 3%, so if you're a newbie this is great. All indicators and price action show reversal.

&#x200B;

$ILPT - What a beautiful channel up, minus that drop off. Above the 200EMA still which is great, so all 3 line up well. Indicators are low, so it should reverse soon.

&#x200B;

$IRT - Brand new channel I have called before, and here we are again. It can make a nice 5% easy, but indicators are split on if it will be a reversal soon. But a great channel.

&#x200B;

$KO - Wait for it to show some life, KO is having tax problems. But it is still in line, and all indicators show that there is a good chance of a reversal.

&#x200B;

$KREF - Called a few days ago, and here we are again. Nice pullback before another push, maybe! Could dip a little more tomorrow, but a great area of value.

&#x200B;

$MDC - Beautiful channel up that just popped. I think it has a good chance to run another 5 - 10%, but it can also pull back nicely for a buy in. Indicators say it can run

&#x200B;

$STAG - A great area of value in this channel. If it lives here, it will be an easy 5 - 15%. Indicators say it has a high chance of reversal soon.

&#x200B;

$UMH - We called a few days ago, made 5%, now it is pulling back. Indicators look fair at best, but it may make some good moves the next few days. Great setup overall._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Tesla What is happening with Tesla??Why is it so up in just a year??Are people jut investing because of Elon and not analysis??Do you think the price will continue to go up??If so why??I just checked on google the **pe** ratio of Tesla is **1616**....What do you think will happen in the future??What do you think about Tesla market cap being higher than market cap next Top 4 auto makers Combined??I am too curious..._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ I’m probably gonna sound like an idiot but... I can’t seem to find the answer anywhere and I think it’s in part due to the phrasing I use when looking it up on Google. My question is this: Is there a name for taking out what you gain on a stock and keeping what you originally invested? Especially with partial stocks. Also, is this method recommended at all? I’m still new to this and that question has been on my mind for a while._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ ARKK SOLD SELLING TSLA Hey all, so I decided to subscribe to ARKK  so I could follow their daily buy/sell.
Just checked their positions from today and they  first sold 122000 shares of TSLA  probably during the crazy rally and a further 18000 shares as their last trade of the day.

I know everyone is advising to sell as a hard correction is expected.

Is this a clear Confirmation to settle all positions or at least secure some profit?

Just a noob question🤔_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ 15 year old and the stock market Hey guys I’m 15 years old and I’m interested in investing in a company I just recently found I did some research on it and I think it would be a good idea. They just recently signed a deal with Amazon and they are a electric vehicle company that is producing school busses as well as city busses and delivery trucks. They are climbing quite a bit recently and are at $23 a share and I was thinking about investing around $300 so I was just wondering if this is a good idea or not?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ ABML - American Battery Metals Co Hi all,

I was wondering if anyone had any views on $ABML. With the current  explosion and future prospects in EV, I was thinking about the obvious key inputs into the batteries (Li, Ni, Co, etc). One thing that I think is being overlooked is the battery recycling process. There's not too much information available on this company but from what I've read is they have some very innovative technology for the batteries and are stealing quite a few Tesla engineers to help with the process. 

Would be interesting if anyone was familiar and had any thoughts on the potential growth of this company._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ PSA: SRPT has just lost half its market cap in the AH! I urge everyone to buy this dip.

SRPT is a biotech company most recently working on a new gene transfer therapy product for DMD. Phase 1 of this study resulted in data that was not statistically significant - they could not discern the different between the control placebo and the experimental (treatment) group. 

this stock is known for wild fluctuations (as are many biotech companies that are working on new product). As of now, they are down over 50% AH, bringing them down to near 52 week lows in a matter of minutes following the release of the report. 

I urge everyone to buy up those call contracts about 20-30% out for January 15th. This will likely cause a series of limit sell/buy triggers so it's going to be interesting. The RSI is going to be so oversold and I'd expect volume to be significantly heavier than usual. 

Fun fact: Also looks like someone placed a 500 put block contracts at $140 strike price just two days prior. They'll likely exit at 3M profit with that trade. Seems pretty suspicious. 

Good Luck all!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ DD: Is a 1 fund portfolio the best option? I'm 20 and I've been trying to determine what asset allocation I should use for my Roth IRA. I currently use the 3 fund portfolio popularized by Bogleheads (80% total US stock index, 10% total international stock index, 10% US bond index). However, I was recently backtesting my portfolio and was surprised to find that investing 100% in the total US stock market yielded [considerably higher results](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&timePeriod=4&startYear=1985&firstMonth=1&endYear=2021&lastMonth=12&calendarAligned=true&includeYTD=false&initialAmount=6000&annualOperation=1&annualAdjustment=6000&inflationAdjusted=true&annualPercentage=0.0&frequency=4&rebalanceType=1&absoluteDeviation=5.0&relativeDeviation=25.0&showYield=false&reinvestDividends=true&portfolioNames=false&portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&symbol1=VTSMX&allocation1_1=80&allocation1_2=80&allocation1_3=100&symbol2=VGTSX&allocation2_1=10&allocation2_2=20&symbol3=VBMFX&allocation3_1=10). Over a 24 year period (1996-2020) the results were as follows:

Three Fund (80/10/10): **$622,725**

Two Fund / Equity Only (80/20/0): **$623,357**

One Fund / US Only (100/0/0): **$694,082**

I know that past performance doesn't necessarily equate to future gains, but a $71,000 difference in performance over 24 years is substantial. Given that I likely wont retire for another 40+ years, this could mean missing out on hundreds of thousands of dollars.

I was also surprised to see that the max drawdowns for these portfolios were relatively similar (between 47-52%), which tells me that the floor for an equity-heavy 3-fund portfolio is not as high as I expected.

I know no one has a crystal ball, but is this a convincing argument for a One Fund portfolio or is there something else I am missing?

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Protecting gains in a position I have a few stocks where the price is way above the 50d and 200d moving averages, which is usually a sign that the stock is overextended.  In such a situation and without selling the stock outright, what are some ways I can protect my gains? 

I thought of using a protective put, but it looks like puts that are further out in time and/or closer to the current price are expensive.  

Any other methods I can use?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ How many shares of Tesla stock do you guys own ? This stock is going absolutely crazy!!!
