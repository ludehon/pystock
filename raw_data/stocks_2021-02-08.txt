 Lets talk about $REGN I bought in around the secondary and for a little while it was amazing. Recently it seems like it is where money goes to die (under 500). It probably has no business touching $479 ever again but I am trying to figure out if I just hold onto it or what?

I guess the CEO has some super aggressive targets he has to hit in order to get paid and I assume that he will do absolutely everything he can to get paid but I am seeing semimemes like STPK go berzerk while $REGN.does basically nothing.

I’m a student pilot, also “working” in the industry, so I know the company quite well, since I know many people (pilots, cabin crew, maintenance, operational staff) working inside the company. 

**Some info:** 

**- market cap €14.61b**

**- Net income 2018: €1.45b / 2019: €885m / 2020: €649m**

**- Current stock value as of 02/08: €15.67 on UK market**

One of the most solid companies in Europe. Their SOPs (standard operational procedures) are among the most efficient and safe-oriented in the industry. I’ve read a lot regarding their operations, and the stuff is always reminded about safety and efficiency of flight operations. This can be seen if you look at their incident/accident records, which is basically perfect  
They recently ordered 210 737-max, and have a fleet of 479 aircrafts. Their business model is basically unbeatable: look for an airport which is almost going bankrupt, invest in new facilities such as hangars, maintenance and terminals (Bergamo, in Italy, is a great example) and then, once the work is done, set agreements with the airport operator about landing fees and fuel prices. During the years, RYA built a net of bases around Europe serving minor airports, allowing them to keep ticket prices really low.   
Few companies are able to compete with the fairs offered by RYA. The only realistic competitors are EasyJet and WizzAir. These two companies operate in different routes/airports, so they’re not a big threat. Their load factor is the highest in the world. In 2017 was set at an astonishing 94.7%. Overall, despite the pandemic, they will emerge as one of the strongest company in the world.

There are some big **“BUT”**: the general public perception of the company is not really great. It’s usually viewed as “the company which doesn’t pay its employees” or “They run their airplanes on minimum fuel” (As a guy working in the industry, I can assure you RYA is one of the safest companies around, as you can see from their incident records). Over the year, the company received various fines for irregular actions concerning the employments contract of their employees, which, in the last years, have been striking as a protest.   
A part from this, my biggest concern is their stock value: €15 is already a good value. It’s actually just a couple of € below their all-time-high. Considering the situation we are living in, this is actually amazing to see. It will probably rise after the pandemic; as other companies will go bankrupt. There’s gonna be even few competitors, and more room for RYA to grow.

**Introduction**

“[FuboTV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FuboTV) ($FUBO) is an American streaming television service that focuses primarily on channels that distribute live sports, including NFL, MLB, NBA, NHL, MLS and international soccer, plus news, network television series and movies.

Launched on January 1, 2015 as a soccer streaming service, FuboTV changed to an all-sports service in 2017 and then to a virtual multichannel video programming distributor (vMVPD) model. As a vMVPD, FuboTV still calls itself sports-first but its expanded channel lineup targets cord cutters, offering a selection of major cable channels and OTT-originated features that can be streamed through smart TVs, mobile and tablets and the web. The service is available in the United States, Canada and Spain as of 2018."

From their [home](https://www.fubo.tv/welcome) page:

They are the only competitors in their space of digital sports broadcasting, offer 4K streaming and upscaling of live sports, cloud DVR capability ranging from 250 or 1000 hours on standard plans, and is available on Roku, Apple TV, Amazon Fire TV, Chromecast, Samsung Smart TVs, Xbox One, Android TV, Android Smart TVs, and Android/iOS smartphones and tablets, with plans ranging from $24.99/month to $79.99/month (not including add-ons).

[They have also recently acquired one company and have made plans to acquire another to allow for in-house sports betting. They have stated in a press release that they plan to release a sportsbook before the end of the year.](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/fubotv-accelerates-development-sportsbook-140000632.html) This will push them into a broader spectrum outside of only TV and sports streaming, and into the sports betting sector along with DraftKings ($DKNG), FanDuel ($PDYPY), and Penn National Gaming ($PENN).

[**Plans and Add-ons**](https://www.fubo.tv/welcome/channels)

FuboTV offers three standardized plans as of February 8, 2021: the Family plan is priced at $64.99/month (normally $75.97/month), Elite at $79.99/month (normally $100.95/month), and Latino Quarterly at $24.99/month, along with offering additional add-ons. Each plan offers a range of channels, cloud DVR capabilities (which allows fast-forwarding through commercials), and casting to multiple devices simultaneously. Only the Elite plan does not offer a 7-day free trial (*Channels page).*

The Family plan includes 117 channels (mostly news and entertainment with roughly 40 that offer sports, including ESPN), up to 250 hours of DVR space, and casting to 3 devices at once. The quarterly prepaid includes a free upgrade to 1000 hours of DVR space and 5 casting devices at home with 3 on the go (*Channels page).*

The Elite plan includes 164 channels (includes an additional “47 entertainment channels”), up to 1000 hours of DVR space, and casting to 5 devices at home with 3 on the go. This plan does not offer a quarterly prepaid (*Channels page).*

The Latino Quarterly plan includes 250 hours of DVR space and can be streamed on up to 3 devices at once, but only has 32 channels. This plan needs to be prepaid every 3 months for a total charge of $74.97 and does not offer a monthly service (*Channels page).*

Upgrades include additional DVR space--1000 hours for an additional $6.99/month for the Family and Latino Quarterly--and increased device casting--an additional 2 devices at home with 3 on the go for another $9.99/month for the Family and Latino Quarterly plans. You can also add a variety of channels and sports packages (the Latino Quarterly has fewer channel add-ons compared to the Family and Elite plans, which both have the same channel varieties). Sports Plus with NFL RedZone is an additional $10.99/month, but includes all professional and college sports broadcasting services for football, basketball, baseball, hockey, tennis, fighting, etc. (*Channels page).*

Fubo has recently removed its former Standard plan, which included only 65 channels, up to 2 casting devices, and only 30 hours of DVR support for $60/month.

**Financials and Growth**

Fubo has yet to file an annual report as they have gone public in October of 2020, but they have filed a [10-Q](https://s21.q4cdn.com/819998841/files/doc_financials/2020/q3/16be93b6-1b43-471a-a81f-a8b07e43e47c.pdf) for Q3 2020. All numbers in thousands.

Assets-

Between December 31, 2019 and September of 2020, assets have increased from $368,225 to $799,313 (a 117% increase) . Total current assets increased from $17,973 to $58,016, but accounts receivable decreased from $8,904 to $6,975--this may be attributed to the increase in prepaid subscriptions which increased from $1,445 to $12,177 which shows strong customer satisfaction and retention.

Liabilities-

Liabilities have increased from $145,049 to $290,376 (a 100% increase). The largest contributors to their liabilities are “Due to related parties” increasing from $665 to $85,847, “Warrant liabilities” increasing from $24 to $28,085, and “Accounts payable” from $36,373 to $61,679. Long-term borrowings have decreased from $43,982 to $25,905.

Revenues-

Subscription revenues increased by $53,433, totaling $92,945 for the year. Total revenues including advertisements and licensing have increased by $61,202, totaling $112,669 for the year and an increase of 47% YOY. Q4 revenue is estimated to be between $94,000 and $98,000 which would be a 77-84% increase YOY.

Expenses-

Subscriber related expenses total $114,315 for the year. Total expenses have totaled $500,249 for the year.

Subscribers-

Ended Q3 with 455,000 paid subscribers, a YOY increase of 58%, and plans to end 2020 with over 545,000, an increase of 72% YOY.

**The vMVPD Sector**

Cord-cutting has become increasingly popular over the last few years with consumers dropping traditional cable and satellite networks in favor of streaming services--such as Hulu, Netflix, Disney+, etc.--and vMVPD services.

[In 2019 alone, 6.3 million people cut their cable connection, totaling 39.3 million. In a survey of what they might miss most from cable networks, 52% said they don’t miss anything, 23% missed live events on TV, 22% missed news, and 19% missed live sports](https://www.emarketer.com/content/most-cord-cutters-aren-t-missing-cable-tv)*.* Although not all of those that miss aspects of cable will pay for another subscription service, the sentiment exists for a sports-focused platform that offers other large networks as well.

[Another report by Parks Associates reveals that 17% of vMVPD subscribers switched from traditional TV within the last twelve months. In the same report, a survey conducted on current broadband households determined that 43% were “likely to switch to a… vMVPD within the next 12 months](https://www.broadbandtechreport.com/video/article/14196415/report-examines-vmvpd-sector-growth-in-broadband-pay-tv-market)*."* The potential growth exists for the live digital broadcasting space, although it is slowing down.

With the spread of COVID and quarantines, people have been spending more time at home. When things open and quarantines end, that will be the true test for these providers as people will spend less time watching TV.

**The Sports Betting Sector**

Legal sports betting has taken a huge leap in recent years with the introduction of online sports betting; the ability to place wagers from anywhere at any time and have instant gratification has boomed with its slow legalization. [This sector has a forecasted value of $150 billion with other competitors already having a completed project and vast market share. In 2019, DraftKings ($DKNG) and FanDuel (PDYPY) controlled 83% of the market share](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/27/fanduel-draftkings-race-to-win-150-billion-sports-betting-market.html).

[FuboTV plans to join into this space with its own sportsbook. Their recent acquisition of Balto Sports in December of 2020, whose business was in simulating fantasy sports games, is Fubo’s first step into sports wagering. They plan to create a free-to-play gaming system alongside online sports wagering](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201201006185/en/fuboTV-Acquires-Balto-Sports-as-First-Step-Into-Online-Sports-Wagering-Market)*.*

[Their next planned acquisition, which was announced in January of 2021, will be to acquire Vigtory, a sports betting and interactive gaming company. According to BusinessWire, they plan to utilize Vigtory’s “sportsbook platform and digital gaming assets, and its consumer-driven betting technology, to develop a frictionless betting experience for fubo’s customers](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210112005596/en/fuboTV-Accelerates-Development-of-Sportsbook)."

These recent acquisitions set Fubo up to create an all-in-one viewing and betting experience, which could add new customers to their subscriber list and seal them into online wagering.

[It has been over two years since the Supreme Court has denied the federal ban on sports betting, which would have made online betting illegal in all of the United States. Currently, more than two dozen states have legalized sports betting, but most have only legalized in-person betting. More states may be willing to legalize to take advantage of the increased revenues and taxes associated with gambling and online wagering. As of 2020, six additional states plan to legalize some form of betting, although some are only allowing in-person. There are an additional 14 states that are considering the notion to allow legal gambling, whether in-person, online, or tribal](https://www.actionnetwork.com/news/legal-sports-betting-united-states-projections).

**Management and Investors**

David Gandler - CEO / Director / Co-Founder

Appointed as CEO and director in April of 2020. Prior to Fubo, Gandler had a 15 year career in marketing and advertising in local broadcast and cable TV within both general and Hispanic markets at companies such as Time Warner, Telemundo, and Scripps Networks Interactive.

Alberto Horihuela - CMO / Co-founder

In charge of marketing, Horihuela was head of Latin America for SVOD service DramaFever.

Simone Nardi - CFO

Nardi has worked as SVP and CFO of Scripps Networks Interactive where he was responsible for the finance and strategic planning for the company’s international business. Was also a key player in refinancing TVN S.A.’s billion dollar debt.

Large Investors

* Islet Management, LP with 5,108124 shares
* Morgan Stanley with 3,317,333 shares
* FMR LLC with 1,262,907 shares
* BlackRock Inc. with 956,678 shares
* Merger with FaceBank for $100 million revolving credit

**Analysts and Estimates**

Average analyst ratings put Fubo at a Buy to Strong Buy rating with an average price target of $45.50 with a high of $60 and a low of $30. EPS estimates are estimated to be -5.23 for 2020 and -1.64 for 2021.

Currently has a short float of about 75%, but the short volume has been holding at roughly 15-20% over the last month and has drastically declined from its October short volume of over 50%.

Originally valued at $700 million less than a year ago, a current valuation of $3.19 billion is respectable for this company and is on par for its current performance.

**Risks**

* Marketing fails and Fubo is never known as a household name, so consumers stick with other more known providers
* Their sportsbook fails and becomes dead weight and wasted money
* Subscriber count and streaming drops as quarantine lifts, reducing revenues while maintaining expenses
* Consumers opt for cheaper options
* People paying for the sports package cancel when the season is over, creating a boom and bust cycle if not managed correctly

**Final Thoughts / TL;DR**

With its drastic growth over the last year (400% in the last 4 months), support from FaceBank and well-known investors, and plans to join the sports betting sector, FuboTV has potential to become a household name and grow well beyond its current valuation by combining both sports broadcasting and online sports betting into one convenient place. Although unlikely to overthrow any of the current forces, it can become the best live sports broadcaster that people can turn to when they cut cable but want to keep live sports. It has many hurdles to overcome (creating their sportsbook, better marketing, increasing subscriber count, etc.) before it is any real competition to its already established competition.

At a $3.19 billion market cap and very high (75%) short interest, it will be very difficult to realize consistent growth, but it is on par for a company with almost $100 million in revenue.

Please ELI5 if you can. Thanks._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Favorite dividend stocks for long term? I'm one of the lucky ones that got into the stock that shall not be named early and got out with some money. I realize this was probably a once in a lifetime opportunity I got really lucky on and it would like to reinvest in something more steady.

I've only been investing for about a year and am looking for advice on what dividend stocks seem like safe bets that I could hold for a long time, rather than just having my money rot in my bank account.

Thanks in advance for the advice!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ New Small Investor Looking for Advice  

So just like the title says, I'm looking for some advice on investing in the stock market. Really, what I'm looking to do is to use an app  (open to suggestions for this) that I can dump 50-100 dollars in a month to act like a savings account, but with a higher rate of return. My son will be driving in two years and I'd like to have money to buy him a decent car; If I can put away 2-3 grand and have it make another 500 bucks in that time I'd be more than happy. I also have a 403(b) right now so I don't necessarily need to put money away into something along those lines; I'm really looking for the flexibility to withdraw when I need to without penalties.

I've been messing around for the past two weeks or so and have invested in Palantir, Nano-X, Nano Dimension, Air BnB, and DraftKings and have been very happy with the returns so far, but I realize that I should probably diversify a bit more from technology and have a look at some other offerings.

What sorts of things should I be looking at? What are some safe stocks (I know nothing is 100% safe) to invest in that have a decent annual rate of return, and should I mix in a few high risk/reward stocks along with the safer bets?

Thanks in advance for any replies.

Crossposted in r/StockMarket_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ How does everyone feel about Sundial Growers? I placed a 2 x ($1) call contracts for 200 shares by 2/12. 
($1.30 break-even) 

From what I've seen in discussions and estimates, investors seem mostly bullish on a lot of cannabis stocks.  Based on what you've all seen and heard, how do you feel about Sundial? 

I've had success with Organigram in the last few weeks, as I bought ≈ 250-300 shares at different price points below $1.37 before the recent growth spike.  This makes me feel like a lot of cannabis companies are headed in the same direction, especially with new administration and political direction in the US.

Your comments, questions, insults, etc. are greatly appreciated!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $PAVM Bull Case (Golden Cross, MACD Cross, Two FDA cleared devices etc) GERD is super common... Upwards of 25% of adults in western culture have GERD and climbing... obviously... 

GERD can lead to cancer. Esophageal cancer is among the deadliest, with 5 year survival rates below of less than 20%. 

PavMed received breakthrough designation for its EsoGuard/EsoCheck system to test for GERD/Eso Cancer, this device is the only one on the market with any real accuracy (sponge device is trash, less than 80% accuracy, breaks off, scrapes entire esophagus...)

They just started being reimbursed @ a blended rate of \~$2k per test on Jan 1 '21

So, lets do a little math.... 

PAVM has a current market cap of $160M

The US has a population of 332M

If 25% have or are susceptible to GERD..... we'll call it \~80M

If just ONE PERCENT of this at risk segment of the US gets tested we're talking about $160B in revenue... at \~80% profit

We're talking 10x current market cap... with just 1% getting tested... In **just** the US... 

Oh and $PAVM also has 8 other devices in various stages of development... CarpX approved last year, carpal tunnel procedure can now be done by a tech.... No more surgery, healing time 1-2 weeks, not 3 months... 

One of the devices they're working on is a LASER glucose monitor... This would turn PAVM into a global player in the medical device field overnight with one PR.... 

They also hired Stanley Lapidus of Exact Sciences ($EXAS) who commercialized poop in a box. 

TLDR; This company is a hidden gem about to explode straight to the moon. 

TL;TLDR; BUY $PAVM_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Huya the most undervalued stock in the market? The most undervalued stock on Wall Street AND a high short %

Huya operates a freemium platform. It sells ads across its platform, but it generates most of its revenue from virtual gifts viewers can buy for their favorite broadcasters. Last quarter, Huya generated 94% of its revenue from its live streaming business, and the remaining 6% from online ads. Remember this last part. 

Huya's monthly active users (MAUs) rose 18% year-over-year to 172.9 million last quarter. Within that total, its mobile MAUs grew 16% to 74.2 million, and its total number of paid users increased 13% to 5.3 million.

CEO Rongjie Dong attributed that growth to an increase in e-sports tournaments throughout the shorter summer and its deeper ties with Tencent, the world's largest video game publisher. If Huya closes its planned merger with Douyu next year, its MAUs could more than double to nearly 370 million, with over 13 million paid users.  

PINTEREST has less monthly active users and is worth 50 BILLION!!!!

Huya generates higher profits because it shares a near-duopoly with Douyu, is backed by Tencent's massive video game business, and generates most of its revenue from higher-margin virtual gifts instead of lower-margin digital ads.

Wall Street expects Huya's revenue and earnings to rise 40% and 74%, respectively, this year. Next year, analysts expect its revenue and earnings to rise 23% and 36%, respectively. Based on those estimates, Huya looks incredibly cheap at 19 times forward earnings and just two times next year's sales.

Those forecasts don't account for Huya's potential merger with Douyu, which could easily double its annual revenue. But its valuation should remain roughly the same after the all-stock merger, since it will grant current shareholders of Huya and Douyu equal halves of the new company.

Tencent holdings is about to merge DOYU and HUYA into the biggest online gaming streaming service in China (roughly 80%). 

I predict tencent (the “kingmaker”) will turn it into an advertisement giant, they will have roughly 370 million active users (think Pinterest at 50B mcap) at a market cap of 10B (post merger). 

This is a HIGHLY shorted stock at 35% of float. It is being manipulated, I believe, because the shorts are having a problem covering with the recent run up (they just filed the merger with the SEC) so an “analyst” gave it a downgrade to help them out today. 

This is a buying opportunity of a lifetime. Huya/DOYU will be a dominate player in the biggest growing sector there is right now (Chinese gaming)... and UNLIKE GameStop, it is a highly profitable business and IS severely undervalued at it’s current price.

When COVID hit last year and stocks plummeted I thought about investing. Stocks were low but I had no idea where to begin and abounded the idea. I’m currently trying to save up for a down payment on a house and am afraid to touch my cash, all in a checking account. Fast forward to GME a few weeks ago and I decided to take the plunge into investing. Reddit has been very helpful but I still feel like I have no idea what I’m doing, excited to see where this year takes my investment journey. My initial investments are:

GOEV  17 shares at $17.11

ALT      12 shares at $18.96
FSR     4.5 shares at $16.6

As title says, I'm fairly young and I have about \~5k I'd like to put into some stocks. I'm willing to take risks with this and I'm OK with possibly losing money on this, although obviously I'm looking for high growth. After reading up on other DD's and doing my own research for the past few weeks this is what I'm planning:

\-20% AAPL: I've already made this investment, I think this is a no-brainer right now

\-20% DIS: Along with things like Disney+, DIS is bound to rebound as America opens up in the future. I'd like to go in on Disney for the long term but it's currently at ATH so I'm wary of buying in right now

\-20% BB: I already bought in at 14.40. I'm really upset I didn't wait just a few days when I could've bought in at \~12 but I'm confident in seeing them hit their ATH in the coming year or two

\-20% ARKK: I understand ARKK has already grown a ton in the past year, but I'm a believer in their innovation picks and I see a good amount of growth up ahead for the rest of the year

\-20% ARKG: I trust Cathie's investments in the genomic industry and I personally believe a genomic "revolution" lies ahead for us with the advances we're making in software

I know there are much safer picks out there and even some riskier ones, but in my eyes I think there is huge growth potential for this in the near future.

I'm not sure what to look at to tell the difference._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $KMPH Breaking Out KemPharm (KMPH) is a clinical biotech company that develops 'pro-drugs' which are modifications to existing drugs. 

The promising pro-drug candidate that has caused shares to go up +30% today is KP415, an ADHD pro-drug that offers an extended release profile (i.e. take 1 dose per day instead of 3x a day) for methylphenidate which is a first-line treatment for ADHD, particularly for children. The extended release characteristic also has potential to lower the abuse potential for the drug as it has a lower 'drug-liking' rating than methylphenidate alone, and is comparable to a placebo. 

KP415 has successfully completed Phase 3 trials, awaiting PDUFA decision on 2nd Mar. The approval is expected as KP415 is a pro-drug very similar to an existing drug (Vyvanse), and has been proceeding down a fast-track approval pathway due to it being a modifications of an existing approved drug. 

KP415 can be compared to a leading ADHD drug called Vyvanse, which is a pro-drug form of amphetamine, which is the other drug of choice to treat ADHD. 90% of patients respond to either methylphenidate or amphetamine based drugs, and the pro-drug forms have high marketability due to their lower substance abuse potential (think of parents approving medication to children). Vyvanse has ~$3.2bn in sales out of a total $8bn branded ADHD drug market, with the total ADHD market generating sales of ~$15bn. 

KMPH has partnered with a commercial delivery provider with a deal of up to $450m based on net sales for methylphenidate pro-drugs, primarily KP415, but a similar pro-drug KP484 is in the pipeline that would be related. KMPH has another pro-drug of hydrocodone has been approved and has an associated deal of up to $50m, demonstrating their ability to navigate the regulatory and delivery pitfalls. Note that their leadership includes experience from Shire pharmaceuticals (now part of Takeda), that developed Vyvanse, so this is a very known market to them. 

Finally, KMPH recently restructured their debt which was holding them back, and now has cash on hand for several months (at least) of operations. 

Valuation-wise, taking a 10% share of Vyvanse's $3bn sales as a comparson would give potential revenues of $300m market. With an assumed royalty at 5% of net sales we could expect $15m profit annually. With a P/E 10 (pessimistic) this would bring us to a 150m company.

KMPH at $9.20 has a market cap of $107m currently so a $150m cap shows an upside of +40% = $13 share price low end estimate. On the high end, it could easily be double that, given that methylphenidate is currently first-line choice over amphetamine and could displace a significant amount of Vyvanse sales, as well as carve a larger share of the greater ADHD market - there's certainly enough growth room for both pro-drugs given their lower abuse potential. 

Someone else posted some DD on KMPH previously to hold up till PDUFA and sell before, which is certainly a way to play this. I see longer term value in KMPH, given their recent debt restructuring and pro-drug pipeline which also makes them potentially an acquisition target. 

Disclosure: I currently hold a long KMPH position at $9, which I was hoping to enter before the run up today, but likely to hold past the PDUFA.

Founded in 2013, Lucira had already developed a single-use kit to diagnose influenza when it shifted gears to focus on SARS-CoV-2 detection in the COVID-19 pandemic. In November, the company won emergency use authorization (EUA) from the U.S. FDA for its [COVID-19 All-in-One Test Kit](https://cdn-a.william-reed.com/var/wrbm_gb_food_pharma/storage/images/publications/pharmaceutical-science/biopharma-reporter.com/article/2020/11/18/fda-authorises-first-covid-19-home-self-testing-kit/11954738-3-eng-GB/FDA-authorises-first-COVID-19-home-self-testing-kit.jpg), making it the first prescription molecular diagnostic test for the SARS-Cov-2 virus that can be performed from start to finish in the comfort of one’s home.

If you traded 3-4 years ago, you'd probably realize that when a stock back then went green for an extended period of time with no news, normally it'd be a bad buy since you'd be trying to time the top (as the saying goes, buy the dip!). Every stock in existence follows an up/down trend line whether or not it's going bullish or bearish. It's been blowing my mind that this isn't really the case in the current market, red days are becoming fewer and fewer. Seems like every time I open my app, every stock (less a couple) is green. In the summer I thought "Wow what a rally after such a huge hit from COVID, the market will likely consolidate soon", then I thought the exact same thing in late fall, and now here we are in mid winter and it just keeps running. 

I have broken down a few points as to why this could be happening.

* More people are at home and capable of day trading, thus more people are putting money into the market
* People are saving money by being at home. Money which would go towards transportation, retail purchasing, restaurants etc. is now going into other areas.
* Stimulus checks are technically a large sum of money being dumped into the net economy. Each time this money changes hands a small percentage will end up in the hands of a wealthier person. These wealthy people will likely put that money into investments.
* We are still seeing the effects of unlimited QE that given back in March/April. Technically, the ratio of a stock price to the total US net worth may be very similar now to what is was then. However due to the pumping of "free money" into the economy, the total amount of cash floating in the US economy would go up, inflating stock prices. This really sucks for anyone who hasn't been in the stock market, since this would have been the only way to increase your income to match the massive inflation that is currently occurring.

When would the stock market go down?

* When people need to take money out, duh. Could be to pay taxes which governments will inevitably raise to cover their debts.
* If the banks can't pay back their debts.
* The wealth gap between older generations and younger generations is AFAIK, higher then it's ever been. If money is being taken out by boomers faster then it is being replaced by millennials, it could cause a decrease in the market.

I don't see the market crashing in the near future unless there are some behind the scenes shenanigans going on with banks loaning out way more money then they can afford to.

Who is even $AI?

$AI is the ticker symbol for [C3.ai](https://c3.ai/), which is an enterprise AI company. They provide a modular AI solution for enterprise companies and have big name clients across the Federal government, finance, and manufacturing.

$AI had an IPO last Dec that was largely unnoticed. Their IPO price was $42 on Dec 8 that opened to the public on Dec 9 at $100. There was a somewhat quiet response within the first week staying between $90 - $128 but from Dec 15 - Dec 25 it soared from $99 to it's ATH of $183.90. Since then, it has faced lots of resistance around $150 with support around $120. Over the past few weeks, it's been forming a pennant indicator and accumulating ready for a breakout currently in the handle of a cup and handle. The price target is $170 as it looks to try test ATH again.

Others from Trading View concur with a bullish sentiment - [https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NYSE-AI/ideas/](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NYSE-AI/ideas/).

While I think $AI is overall pricey for the long-term, they are in a rapidly growing domain with large contract opportunities to easily double and triple revenue YoY. Just because it's expensive (eg valuation is high), doesn't mean it's not a good deal.

Thoughts? How many of you trade recent IPO companies and if not, what do you look for before determining to be a longer-term investor (e.g. not day trading)?

We are building a new web of decentralized (p2p) databases that will enable to create content the way they like, and connect it to a p2p network where other contributors built their own database. It also contains a browser that can show visualization in 2D and 3D. On top of that network, we will have a p2p application store hosted and managed by its network.

To make this easier to explain, Ill use a potential use-case that fits perfectly well with stock trading.

Imagine a group of people creating a database that explains the different products that a specific field has.  Let's say the product is water filters.

Then, we have a group of scientists that read whitepapers and comment on them.  They comment on the whitepapers of the research behind different water filters products.

You then have a something syncing social network data to databases, enabling the ability to discover if people are talking about water filters, and which ones.

Then, you have someone creating lists of leads that work in companies.  That person wants to approach them to sell them something, but that data could be used to know which person works in which company, and what they are saying on social media.

You also have someone crawling news and put the data in a database, then add the sources to the news articles in order to rank them from credible to fake.

At last, you have someone taking sales ranking using the ebay and amazon marketplaces and put them in a database.

At last, you have a software developer, fetching data from all these databases and creating a dashboard related to water filter products.  

That dashboard contains:

* The sentiment of the company from employees (how they personally feel, if they talk about the product they build on social media, what's their sentiments, etc). 

* What credible media tells about the stock of water filters companies.  It contains the data of what researchers thinks about each product.

* The sentiment of retail traders on social media regarding that company.

* The fundamentals of the companies in the water filter business

* Previous sales on marketplaces.

You then can connect your broker's application using their api and correlate the data with the price of stocks/options over time.

Then can decide to take position on the ones you like.

Then, the application that the developer created can be sold inside the decentralized (p2p) marketplace within the network, allowing him to make a revenue and allowing traders to acquire data to make better due diligence.

If so, why?
If not, why?

I am new to the stock thing, so I am looking for companies that may help me learn how to invest, without losing too much money.

People are talking about AMC, is it a good choice?

Sorry for the questions._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ At what point should we come to terms that AMC won’t see $15.00 for a long while? I currently own 15 stocks.  One of those stocks is AMC.  The 14 others are a combination of tech, EV, and weed stocks.  Most high risk/high reward but a few “safe” bets such as AAPL, AMD, and NVDA.  

I bought AMC at $15.85 a couple of days before it tanked.  I’ve been holding it hoping that it recovers to just break even, but I’m not too optimistic about that now.  I’m currently down 62%.

I do ok picking the rest of my stocks.  Even with that clunker AMC, I am running at about an 18.5% gain across my entire portfolio

So my question is this, should I dump AMC and reinvest the remainder in a better stock if I can average an 18.5% gain on this new stock?

Now that I'm getting into stock trading, that's a bit of a bummer, unless I've missed something._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ DD on Astra (HOL) Hey, I wanted to cover Astra a rocket company which recently had a merger with HOL.

Holicity
- HOL raised 275 million when it went public last year. As part of the deal with Astra, Holicity will funnel about $300 million into the company, and up to $200 million will be brought in from funds managed by BlackRock. This gives Astra a valuation of more than $2.1 billion when the transaction is complete. 

Astra 
- Is a small launch vehicle company that was founded in 2016 by Chris Kemp and Adam London. Astra attempts to carry small satellites or spacecrafts into any part of the Earths orbit using a dedicated small launch rocket for both commercial and military uses. Astra is looking to build rockets at scale and wants to launch rockets monthly, weekly and even daily. Astra fell just short of reaching orbital velocity by 0.5 Km on its latest test launch in December, although Kemp considers it a success and said “The hardware on this system performed flawlessly through the entire flight,” and “This far exceeded our team’s expectations.”  Astra plans commercial launches by this summer, monthly launch at years end and daily launches by 2025. At this point they have 50 launches currently booked and $150 contracted some of which are from NASA and US military. 

Competition 
- The biggest competition to Astra would be Rocket lab and Virgin Orbit which has yet to reach space. I don’t think Space X would be considered a direct competitor as their rockets are much larger scale. Rocket lab (not public) is the furthest along in launching of satellites into space with their electron rocket, they were recently able to launch a communication satellite for a German company on Jan 20th of this year. If there’s a problem I see with the Astra technology here, it’s that their rockets are not reusable like that of Rocket Lab or Space X. But if they can manufacture rockets at scale and use materials that allow them keep costs low I don’t think there should be a problem. 

Market
- Space is an emerging market and there is a lot of room for new companies in this industry to grow. This can be seen with Virgin Galactic a company with no revenue and a lot of hype being currently valued at market cap of 12 billion. I believe Astra which also has a long way to go but possesses a much better business model and fills a growing need should be poised for long term growth._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ How do Call Debit spreads work on apps?

I sell a Call Contract at $206 to Person A

I am now in a Call Debit spread

So my question is, how do the apps, like WeBull, work these? If Person A exercises their contract, forcing me to sell them 100 stocks at $206, does the app know to automatically exercise my contract with Person B to buy theirs at $205 then sell to Person A at $206? Or, if the stock goes up to $230 and person A exercises their contract, would it force me to buy 100 stocks at $230, making me negative $1400, where I have to quickly activate my own contract with Person B to buy theirs at $205 while the price of the stock is $230, so I can sell them at $230 and get my money back + profit? Because that way sounds way more riskier. Would be nice if the whole spread is automatic._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ PINS & SNAP beat earnings, which is the better long term buy? What’s Going On Here?

Snap Inc. and Pinterest both reported better-than-expected results late last week, but the companies’ futures have very different filters on them.

What Does This Mean?

There isn’t exactly much to do these days, and social media B-listers Snapchat and Pinterest have been happy to step into the void and pick up millions of new users. All those extra eyeballs made their platforms much more attractive places for advertisers to park their brands last quarter, which might be why Snap and Pinterest’s sales climbed 62% and 76% respectively compared to the same time the year before.

Still, there was one big difference between them: Pinterest’s expectations for this quarter topped analysts’ estimates, but Snap’s forecasts – hampered by recent privacy changes that'll limit its ability to target ads – came in well below.

Why Should I Care?

The bigger picture: It pays to stay above the drama.
There was another reason Snap’s outlook took a hit: advertisers have temporarily been halting campaigns to protest its role in exacerbating the Capitol riots. And it’s not the only platform shedding ad dollars: Facebook has lost the tailwind it gained from the US election, and Twitter’s decision to ban the former president might dent this year’s activity and, with it, ad revenue. At least Pinterest didn’t report any such worries: its users' zealotry is directed more toward macramé than insurrection.

 We are trying to get feedback from those who currently use services like MetaStock, Worden TC2000, TradeStation, and others.  We would like to know the problems you have encountered using such applications as well as features you wished they had implemented or those that need work. 

Not sure if this is the right place or not but any valuable input would be greatly appreciated.

# Key takeaway.

Oppenheimer Holdings (OPY) is extremely undervalued by any metric. Don’t be put off by its 22% rise since the end of January – it’s still playing catch-up to its fair valuation (based on historical metrics). Even without taking into account its impressive track record of growth, a fair valuation for OPY would be $79.00. If we also consider its growth trajectory and compare it to its peers, its value could surpass even that.

# Company profile.

Oppenheimer Holdings is a small-cap investment bank, market maker, and financial services company that’s been in operation since the late 1800s. They’re active mostly in the US, although they have branches in Europe, China, and Tel Aviv. They offer wealth management, brokerage services, and advisory services, and act as underwriters for IPOs. They were involved in the IPOs of AirBnB, DraftKings, and Fubo. They’ve been targeted for acquisition a number of times in the distant past, but the deals have never been realized.

As a small-cap stock, they’re woefully under-covered. The latest Seeking Alpha article is from 2016, and there aren’t any analyst ratings for the stock. This lack of coverage represents an opportunity, as OPY appears to be severely undervalued since it is so overlooked. They could also be a target for acquisition in the future, but I’m not factoring this into my thesis.

# Performance.

OPY benefited in 2020 from a high-volatility trading environment that oversaw an increase in retail and institutional commissions. Their investment banking and underwriting branches saw record numbers this past year. 

Furthermore, Oppenheimer has been undergoing sustained growth since some dismal earnings in 2016. Take a look at its EPS:

Net income per share (diluted):

|2013|2014|2015|2016|2017|2018|2019|2020|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|$1.77|$0.62|$0.14|\-$0.09|$1.67|$2.05|$3.82|$9.30|

2020’s incredible earnings put OPY’s P/E at roughly 4.04. That means that if the company’s earnings stay stagnant and neither grow nor decline, and if the stock price stays exactly where it is, it will take roughly only four years for the company to earn enough cash equivalent to the current value of the company. That’s an amazing deal. 

So, how does OPY’s low P/E compare to its historical P/E?

&#x200B;

# Historical P/E ratios.

&#x200B;

|2018|2019|2020|Avg. of past 3 yrs|Current|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|8.5|10.7|6.3|8.5|4.05|

To revert to its historical average P/E, OPY would have to more than double in share value. [We can even see that OPY's P/E right before earnigns was 6.35](http://Ycharts.com/companies/OPY/pe_ratio). In light of recent earnings, OPY’s P/E was recalculated to 3.39, and has continued to climb to 4.05 as the market has been pricing in these exceptional earnings. But even in spite of the reduced risk of post-earnings, and in spite of the company's excellent earnings and growth track, and in spite of the stock's climb, OPY is still nowhere near its average P/E of 8.5. The only time its P/E was any lower was in 2012, 2016, and 2017, when the company had a loss per share. To reach its average P/E of the past three years, OPY would either have to double in price, or it would have to suffer substantial negative growth next year -- and I don't see any potential catalyst for the latter.

&#x200B;

# Current P/E comparison to competitors.

That's all well and good, but how does OPY compare to its closest competitors and their P/E? Maybe *all* financials currently have a low PE?

Competitors:

|Oppenheimer (OPY)|Cowen|Piper Sandler|Berkshire Bank|TrustCo Bank Corp|Century Bancorp|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|4.05|6.8|37.15|17.76^(\*)|11.98|14.52|

^(\*Avg of previous five years as they took a loss last year)

Even when compared to its competitors, OPY is still undervalued -- and when taken in context of the market as a whole, that undervaluation is even more evident: the average P/E of the S&P is around 19.45 (although it's currently around 35.5). OPY is trading at a fraction of this.

&#x200B;

# Other points to consider.

# Share buybacks.

Oppenheimer has also been buying back shares since 2016. Although their 10-K hasn’t yet been posted on the SEC website, they have posted an presentation containing their [unaudited 2020 results](https://www.oppenheimer.com/_assets/docs/earnings/2020/2020-8kq4-pr.pdf):

They bought back 718,522 shares in 2020. They currently have 13,217,335 shares outstanding.

This float is exceptionally low, so once the stock picks up momentum, it can really start making moves. The stock has low short interest, however, so don’t anticipate a squeeze of any sorts. It's also not a sexy company like "dude weed lmao" or fintech, so meme momentum probably won't send it higher. It's simply a stable, strong company that's currently underpriced, and the moves over the past couple of weeks indicate that the market *may* be starting to realize this.

# Dividends.

Oppenheimer has an annual dividend of $0.48, up from the previous years’ dividend of $0.44. Personally, I see this as detrimental to the stock, considering I’m taxed at a high rate on dividends, albeit not on capital gains. Others might view this as a boon to the stock. The dividend does also represent a nice cushion against any financial hardship – they can always cut the dividend if they start taking a loss. Its upcoming ex dividend date is Feb 11.

They also issued a special dividend of $1.00 as recently as 23 Dec 2020. Again, not beneficial for me. I’d prefer they do buybacks.

# Long-term Debt.

So what's the catch? The company must be heavily indebted, and are kicking the can down the street, right? Not so.

|2018|2019|2020|
|:-|:-|:-|
|199m|149m|125m|

OPY’s debt to equity ratio is 18.2% -- exceptionally low. Keep in mind that OPY had a net income of $82m in 2020 – enough to pay down more than half of their debt from just one year's earnings. Insolvency doesn’t appear likely.

&#x200B;

# Bearish considerations.

In all honesty, I can't see many that wouldn't apply to other financial stocks and the stock market as a whole -- a black swan event, terrorist attack, that sort of thing. If the IPO market starts to cool off, or volatility starts to wane, or a plurality of hedge funds go defunct – all of these things could weigh on OPY’s stock. Of course, these risks are inherent to other investment banks as well, which already command a higher P/E ratio more representative of reality. If anyone has some compelling bearish arguments, I'd like to hear them.

I suppose a realistic concern is that, in the near term, momentum could dry up and the stock could take a dip. In that case, I'll be buying more with both hands. Furthermore, and though the two are often connected, the P/E ratio isn't something that inherently dictates the movement of a stock. It's entirely possible for the P/E ratio of the company to persist for a long period below 1, as the market overlooks and misprices this company.

&#x200B;

# Summary of bullish thesis.

\-Revenues and EPS growing YoY

\-Historically undervalued (on the basis of P/E)

\-Undervalued compared to comps

\-Conducting share buybacks

\-Low debt

\-Low float could lead to outsized moves

\-Currently in an uptrend

&#x200B;

# Conclusion.

OPY’s stock had been in a slow, sustained uptrend since September, and recently saw a drastic jump on some stellar earnings. It has been undergoing sustained and impressive growth since 2016, and has a low amount of debt. And yet, it still appears to be undervalued. Its P/E is extremely low compared to its historical average and compared to its competitors. In the short-term, OPY still needs to make up – and currently *is* making up – a lot of ground if it wants to revert back to its historical P/E. To do that, its share value would have to double. Even if it did double, I believe the company still offers good value in the long term, as its earnings have improved substantially over the past few years._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ EXPI up 13% today... y’all doin this?

Do further research and make a decision._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Is Dividends a valid mechanism for return on investment in stocks Hi all, new to stock investing, so naturally got a lot of questions 😅

The recent one is one perhaps addressed to long time/experienced investors. 

Does it make sense to look at dividends as a mechanism for long term returns on investment?

From the little I have learnt so far, it seem price appreciation is the main avenue for long term returns.

I would appreciate if someone knowledgeable more knowledgeable can chime in on this!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ The costs of inflation: Unfair Tax Treatment Capital gains taxes are not adjusted for inflation, therefore, not all trading is as net-positive as one might assume. This is especially an important topic now as the Federal Reserve and the US Government pursue expansionary policies, which will nonetheless fuel the inflation fire.

For example: 

* Jan. 1, you buy $10,000 worth of AAPL (Apple)
* Dec. 31, you sell the stock for $11,000  (nominal gain = $1,000 or 10%)
* If inflation = 10% that year, your real capital gain = $0

Even though your **real** gain is 0, you must still pay taxes on your $1,000 nominal gain.

This came up on my screener and I like the management reshuffle storyline here.  


**Highlights**:  
- 94% Quarter Growth YoY for Q3 2020.  
- 82% Yearly Growth (FY19 = $101.7M, FY20 guidance = $185M).  
- This company is profitable. Guidance for 2020 is $5.5M EBITDA.  
- They have 100+ Commercial & Enterprise customers, including Microsoft, British Telecom, NASA, Homeland Security.   
- Signed a $500M potential 5-year revenue contract with Homeland Security in November 2020.  
- Just today they were awarded a new contract with the Department of Health and Human Services "WidePoint is one of only two U.S. Government ECA providers authorized by the U.S. Department of Defense."  
- 7.79% shares held by insiders, 15.54% held by institutions.  
- By Q4 2021 they are planning to “successfully integrate strategic acquisitions”.  
- In 2017 new management team appointed. The entire board has been appointed their role within the last 3 years. This is what has started the 33% CAGR since 2017.  
- Only $6.68M debt.  
- Only 7.63M shares float.  
- Full earnings expected in March, 2021.  


**Value/Competitors**:  
- Widepoint have a diverse offering so they do not have any direct competitors. From their 10-K report you can see their TM2 solution competes with multiple companies in different market segments, additionally most are private companies.  
- Their P/S ratio is a mere 0.62. This is insanely low for a Tech company with a scalable solution, is profitable AND reporting high levels of growth. I can see this being a multi-bagger.

# [4 things to know before the stock market opens Monday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/08/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-february-8-2021.html)

*****

> # 1. Wall Street set to rise after best week since November

> * Dow futures pointed to an over 100 points gain at Monday’s open, an advance that would exceed the 30-stock average’s closing record and could top its intraday all-time high, both of which happened last month. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq on Friday closed at record highs, while the Dow’s gain was about 40 points shy of a closing record as a disappointing January jobs report boosted hopes for further economic stimulus to help Americans and U.S. businesses during the pandemic. All three stock benchmarks logged their best weeks since November. The Reddit-fueled trading frenzy around short-squeeze names receded as shares of GameStop lost 70% last week, even with Friday’s 19% gain. The previous week, the video game retailer’s stock soared 400%. Shares rose 12% in Monday’s premarket trading.

*****

> # 2. Yellen says Biden stimulus could result in full employment next year

> * The U.S. economy could return to full employment in 2022 if President Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion coronavirus rescue package were passed, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said Sunday. Long-term unemployment is around a historical peak. While Biden has said he wants to get GOP support for his Covid relief measure, Democrats are taking steps toward passing his approach without any Republican votes. Republicans have opposed the $1.9 trillion price tag and called for lowering the income cap for receiving the full $1,400 direct payment.

*****

> # 3. Trump impeachment trial starts this week

> * Pennsylvania Sen. Pat Toomey, one of Donald Trump’s harshest Republican critics in the wake of the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, said Sunday he sees a conviction of the former president at his impeachment trial as “very unlikely.” Trump’s unprecedented second Senate impeachment trial will start on Tuesday. With a 50-50 split in the Senate, it would take 17 Republicans voting with every Democrat to convict. If Senate does so, it could also vote to bar Trump from holding office again or getting certain perks reserved for former presidents.

*****

> # 4. South Africa suspends plans to use AstraZeneca’s Covid-19 vaccine

> * South Africa has suspended plans to inoculate its frontline health care workers with AstraZeneca’s vaccine after a small clinical trial suggested it was not effective in preventing mild to moderate illness from the variant dominant in that country. The disappointing early results from the study, which has yet to be peer-reviewed, indicated that giving the AstraZeneca vaccine may not be useful in South Africa. In the U.S., AstraZeneca’s vaccine has not been approved. Only vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna have been approved for emergency use so far by the FDA. One from Johnson & Johnson will be reviewed later this month by the agency’s vaccine advisory committee.

I am curious what the opinions of the more veteran players here are on this?

I'm a 22y old pal and I've been saving for the last around 6 years now. Unfortunately only the last 1,5 years been into stocks. 

**Currently my portfolio is around 80% dividend stocks and 20% growth stocks.** I have read all the related topics around here and I understand that when "milking passive income", it's easier to yield 3% from multiple cows than it is to get 10% from a single cow (in dividends for example). What I mean is that it would be better to grow first and harvest later, which is the opposite of what I am doing now. I should focus more on growth than on dividends because of my age and time I have left on the market. 

**How would you turn my table around to growth stocks?** Sell the dividend stocks and buy growth stocks? (can be done within days) OR Widen the portfolio with now on only focusing on growth stocks. I got around 40k usd in stocks right now and I believe I can invest around 6-10k usd a year from now on.

For the individual stock portion of my portfolio (25%), I will never sell another stock.

The idea is to buy various shares that I believe will perform well over the next 60-70 years and hold them forever.

Since I am only investing a few hundred each month in stocks, I will put my subsequent contributions into stocks that have gone up, and I will let those that have gone down sit.

Sure this means that I won’t get the best prices, but the reality is that even people who study this stuff 24/7 for their career, still don’t beat the market.

This strategy will ensure that I put more and more money into winners and that I will only lose a minimal amount on my losers. 

Eventually I will find a few TSLAs or AMZNs and DCA into them for several decades. Creating massive returns! (I hope)

Companies like Google, Pinterest, Amazon & others smash earnings reports while Jeff Bezos bows out. Let’s talk about this & other stock market news**

Hello everyone! So, let’s start with the recap of last week, as we saw all 3 major indexes finish the week with big gains with the SP500 & Nasdaq Composite finishing at new record highs while the Dow Jones did also rise for 5 straight sessions. For the week the [DOW](https://imgur.com/NQpg47q) gained 3.9%, the [SP500](https://imgur.com/cY3wx9N) rose by 4.65% and the [Nasdaq Composite](https://imgur.com/T5qgyg5) outperformed gaining just over 6% in what was the best week since early November.

The Volatility [Index](https://imgur.com/Ki1RNHZ) dropped every day last week as it now seats just above 20, with this being a huge level that hasn’t been broken in a long while.

We saw all 11 [SECTORS](https://imgur.com/pp8DYTh) finish the week in the green, with Energy leading the way followed by Consumer Discretionary, Communications & Financials also gaining more than 6%.

[Here](https://imgur.com/tRRK4fZ) is the HEAT MAP from last week, as we saw a hole lot of green in pretty much every sector, with big tech names gaining huge while the biggest lagging sector was Health Care. The big tech names just continue to [increase](https://imgur.com/96Q4J9w) their % of the SP market cap as technology is likely to continue to be one of the best performers in the next decades.

We also saw some interest economic data last week, as manufacturing continue to recover in January as both the [ISM](https://imgur.com/Q9ZPnxF) index and the [PMI](https://imgur.com/nVz0oDe) Index came in pretty solid and continued to stand in expansion territory.

Also, the [ISM](https://imgur.com/jgJ2IbI) Services Index came in better-than-expected rising above expectations due to an increase in employment & new orders.

In terms of Job numbers, we saw [ADP](https://imgur.com/a39dqcB) coming in way better than expected as over 170K jobs were added after a big drop in December. We also saw initial jobless [claims](https://imgur.com/ftMXubP) dropping even more than expected while the continuing jobless claims fell to under 4.6M last week.

This [WEEK](https://imgur.com/vLr3QHG) is pretty quiet in term of economic data, with core CPI, Consumer indexes and jobless numbers being the biggest ones while the [EARNINGS](https://imgur.com/PMP5olx) season continues with some of the most interesting earnings coming from Twitter, Coca-Cola, GM, Uber & PepsiCo while we also have to see how Disney subscriber numbers are continuing to evolve after hugely upgrading their expectations. One other thing that I am also interested to watch is the PayPal investors day on Thursday in which they are expected to provide a 3-to-5-year financial outlook.

In some other stock market [news](https://imgur.com/EcqHtMU), it seems that most of the RBNHD retail investors that have jumped ship are going to Square’s Cash APP with almost 40% of investors choosing the app. We have to see if this trend continues now, after [RBNHD](https://imgur.com/joQIln0) removed limits on all stocks, but regardless, I think Square is a nice FinTech play despite their huge valuation right now, as they will also benefit from the jump in digital currencies and more companies planning to increase investments in integrated POS providers just like Square.

We also had a lot of interesting earnings last week with Amazon [crushing](https://imgur.com/GILwN3r) expectations, beating by almost $7 and almost $6B on revenues as this was the first time Amazon passed the $100B mark in a quarter as the holiday & e-commerce demand combined to give Amazon a 44% increase y/y in sales. The other big [thing](https://imgur.com/WMmAddL) we got from Amazon was that Bezos will step down as CEO as Andy Jassy the current AWS leader will become the next CEO. This news caused some uncertainty for the company, but I believe this is still a long-term buying opportunity as Amazon will remain one of the best companies to own in the world.

Also, one of the biggest fintech companies out there, [PayPal](https://imgur.com/Klv5tD6) showed great strength in their numbers, beating both the top & bottom line as their total payment volume and new active accounts showed continued strength in the move to more & more online payments solutions.

The other big earnings report we saw last week was from [Alphabet](https://imgur.com/5BOUPT0), which also beat by more than $6 and $4B in revenues as they surprised most of the analysts with great beats in most of the segments as their operating margin came in 5% better than expected. The biggest income generator remained the Search & YouTube business as they are still investing huge in their Cloud platform that is still bleeding money, but is very likely to pay out in the long-run.

Other companies also smashed earnings with [Pinterest](https://imgur.com/0zB9SPh) beating expectations after a 76% revenue growth and a 37% user growth while [Ford](https://imgur.com/zerclC2), which was expected to post a loss, turned out positive earnings of $0.43 despite a 9% decrease y/y in total revenues, as the last 2 quarters of the year provided strong evidence that Ford is progressing into turning around the company.

Meanwhile, though they didn’t have an earnings report, [COSTCO](https://imgur.com/6UmGJ7x) reported a rise in sales of almost 18% in January as the total comparable same store sales which rose by 15.9% crushed the analyst expectations of just 11.7%. I believe Costco is one of the best retailers to own despite it trading always at a premium, as the company is also jumping on the e-commerce trend, with a 107% increase in e-commerce sales in January.

And finally, let’s hope for a good day as the [world](https://imgur.com/itl9KxB) stock markets and the US [Futures](https://imgur.com/mlrfLz5) are pointing to a good open with the Nasdaq leading the way after the Treasury Secretary [pushed](https://imgur.com/jfKvaev) for more fiscal aid to help the economy & the unemployment fully recover as fast as possible.

Not sure if the title explains exactly what I mean but I'm always intrigued about the psychology behind people who prefer to buy dead beat companies because the price is low rather than the companies of tomorrow because the price is high. 

It's a pretty simple decision when you think about it right? Would you rather buy companies that are probably going to have incredible growth in the future but you're going to have to pay a lot now to get on the train, or you can buy companies that are probably going to have below average to average growth but you get to buy the shares at a low price?

So high price for high growth, or low price for low growth? That's the question I'm asking... And from many posts I see especially on /r/investing and /r/UKInvesting and sometimes on /r/stocks, it seems like people overwhelmingly prefer buying average run of the mill companies just because the share price isn't high, over the companies of tomorrow because their price is high.

But if there's one thing investing over the years has taught me it's that the share price of great companies is usually always high (or close to it), and with good reason. Why are so many people put off from buying a stock because the price is high? You shouldn't be investing in a company based off the share price anyway.

Take the ARK funds for example, we all know *almost* every company in every fund has amazing potential and many will likely become multi hundred billion dollar companies that will revolutionise the world we live in, and yet people are scared to buy in because the price is high? 

Instead they'd rather buy Exxon mobil, Carnival, Rolls Royce or some other beat down stock even though they **KNOW** these companies are nothing to write home about and their growth is very limited going forward. 


It's almost impossible to find a company of tomorrow whose share price isn't high, and even the few times when they do drop 50% or more it's usually still considered too high for many people to pull the trigger, so they keep waiting for it to go even cheaper and end up missing it completely. So does this mean you're never going to invest in tomorrow? 

It's such a fascinating thing to observe I just want to start a little conversation around it._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Ideas for Russian stocks? Hi everyone, I was looking at the CAPE ratio of each country and saw how relatively cheap Russia and South America are right now. Obviously there are risks associated with this cheapness but I still am interested in trying to diversify in at least Russia. (I like to follow the be greedy when others are fearful saying as I think a lot of fear is excessive and the market overreacts in both directions)
I was looking at some ETFs but they all had an expense ratio of 0.6% or more so I was thinking I could just buy a basket of individual stocks since the ETFs only had around 15 holdings anyway.
Currently I’m looking at SBRCY, OGZPY, and LUKOY. When I put them into a DCF model they seem very undervalued at least compared to US stocks. Does anyone who has experience in Russian stocks have any stock suggestions or just words of advice for someone trying to get into the space? Thanks_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ A question on leverage and margins. By default my broker offers me to buy shares at a 5:1 leverage which leaves me with a 20% margin. I've been reading that margin is something to avoid and that I should really be buying without leverage at all.
So should I be aiming for a 1:1 leverage? I'm new to trading and there is a lot for me to learn._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Now that my student loans don’t accrue interest for another year, what should I do with the money? Obviously I’m going to let my debt devalue by inflation but what should I do with that money instead? 

Normally I would look 10+ years into the future so I wouldn’t be too worried about market volatility, but since I’m expecting to cash out a large portion of my portfolio next September to lump sum pay off my debt before interest occurs , is it smart to use the cash I would be using for debt to invest in stocks? 

I’m worried the bubble will pop and I’ll have to liquidate stock at a bad time in order to pay of debt (4% interest) 

Should I invest in stocks and bank on an increase over the next 12 months, or hoard cash so I can pay my debt off in cash or potentially dump it into stocks during a big dip or even crash? Something in the middle?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Looking for advice on expanding my small portfolio Returns on regular savings accounts aren't great where I live (Ireland), so I decided to take a small chunk of my savings and invest some money in stocks via Revolut (I had the app so it was convenient, but I've applied for a Degiro account to expand my options.) I'm mid-thirties, reasonably financially secure with multiple savings and pension investments already so I'm comfortable with taking some risks.

I'm aiming to grow the portfolio from gains as much as possible rather than continually pouring money from my other accounts into it, so my hope from my first round of picks is early growth to sell partial stakes and reinvest in other areas over the next 3 - 6 months. 

Capital Gains Tax is currently 33% on gains in my country, so I need to factor that in too.

I'd be really interested to hear if anyone has got advice on next steps for diversification? I'm looking around and trying my best to do my own research, and want to focus on stocks currently priced $50/share or below.

Anyway, current portfolio is:

* **Blackberry BB** - 50 shares (avg. $12.50/share) 
* **Marvell Technology Group MRVL** - 5 shares (avg $50/share)
* **United Microelectronics Corp UMC** - 10 shares (avg $9.61/share)
* **GoPro GPRO** - 10 shares (avg $9.36/share)

Obvious memestock hype aside, I think BB is really solid and likely to see quite a bit of growth in the next couple of months thanks to their various partnerships, especially with Amazon.

Marvell and UMC are both in semiconductors and seem well placed for growth as demand in that sector looks ever-increasing.

So as I understand a day trade consists of opening and closing a position within the same day. 

Buy 100, then sell 100 or Buy 100, sell 50, sell 50 are both treated as 1 single day trade.

I also believe you can do something like Buy 50, Buy 50 then Sell 50, Sell 50 as 1 trade.

I would like to know if I bought 100 shares and then sold only 1 but held the rest until the next day; would this constitute as a day trade? 

Thank you for your time._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ How did you all start out? I've started very slowly in investing. I'm on Trading 212 and invested £40 about 3 months ago. I'm up to £109 now.

My method has been to buy loads of stocks under £1 and sell when they go over £5. Some haven't really changed value at all, but they can't go down by much as they weren't worth much in the first place.

I don't know much about the stock market, but is my method very flawed? I realise that dealing with low value stocks means I'm likely to have low value gains also, but it feels less risky to have 40 x £1 investments compared to 1x £40 and over 100% return in 3 months seems good to me.

Hello everyone,

I’m making the switch to more of a professional brokerage and would appreciate some advice on which one to choose. I will likely be mostly executing long term trades but will also do some day trading. I was looking into Active Trader Pro through fidelity as my 401k is through them, but didn’t hear the best reviews. I was also looking into Schwab, IB, and thinkorswim.

For the past few weeks she was an emotional trader and bought stocks of a company that we won't name (pure carbon limbs) at different price points. After explaining to her what averaging down actually meant she managed to reduce the burn to 80 shares @ 220$. But the split is as follows:

23 @ 387$  
9 @ 367$  
20 @ 150$  
8 @ 93$  
11 @ 89$  
10 @ 85$  

And this rollercoaster ride with this stock now hitting 60$/share was enough to make her understand she needs to learn to trade better.

What would a smart trader do in this situation given the following scenario? (1. the stock will go to 20$ / share in the next week and 2. the stock will eventually (6-9 months) go to 150$.

At the moment I don't have the money to do so, but I would like to in the future. Why? Well, my cat has been quite sick with fip, I am currently using a black market drug to treat him cuz there isn't any other option. I know that Gilead holds the patent to this drug. They have been using it for covid. You might have heard of it, it's remdesivir. But remdesivir was originally developed as a drug for cats. Fip happens to be caused my a coronavirus too, not covid19, but close enough that the compound works on that too. They tried it on ebola, but it doesn't work on that.  
I expect that when vaccines are available and the whole plague has died down a bit that they will get back to manufacture a legal drug for fip. They would be crazy not to. Literally millions of cat owners worldwide are already using black market versions to treat their cat for a disease that's usually 100% fatal. I expect if they bring this out then it would mean a nice rise in the stockprice.

So I would like to get in, but I don't know what a good time would be. Developing a drug takes years, and they have put the development for the cat drug on hold twice already ( once for trials on ebola and once for remdesivir). How can I determine when to get in?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Domino's Pizza DPZ for short-term play, Superbowl and earnings. The Superbowl just happened and no doubt Domino's Pizza must've been hella busy. I had to work today, but even my co-workers bought lots of Domino's Pizza and had the game on in the break room. My co-worker said the line was out the door when he went to get the pizza.

On top of Superbowl sales, Domino's Pizza has its earnings on 02/25. DPZ is at support levels right now. Around the $378 area. If you look at its previous earnings, it normally shoots up to ATH leading up to earnings. The last ATH was $433 at its last earnings. I can see it going up to at least $420 again by earnings and then probably dropping afterwards cus it tends to drop after earnings get released.

Big investors such as Warren Buffet have recently been bullish on Japanese companies and for good reason:

1. Large & established
2. Relatively 'conservative' finances with less debt than a typical American or European company of similar size
3. A large domestic market to keep revenues healthy as companies now look to expand abroad

The reason for 3 is that Japan is a demographic timebomb where they have way too many older folk and are still a little too xenophobic to allow enough foreigners in. This creates a dilemma for Japan where it has to decide to either loosen monetary policy and allow their companies to take on more debt to expand (and drive economic growth) or let in millions of young outsiders.

Currently, Japan is choosing the former._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Advice on Portfolio Hey guys,

Company - SunRun

Product - Residential Solar Systems

Recently merged with Vivint.

More than 500,000 systems and installing a new system every 2 minutes according to their website

This is a clean energy play in a growing industry with falling costs of install and energy production. The Mega Watt Costs have fallen dramatically over the last 10 years and are expected to fall more in the future.

Majority of their customers save 5-45% in the first year of their system. Only 3% of residential homes have solar right now.

Distribution agreements with Costco and Home Depot

Long term, utility generated power rates will keep rising and have rolling blackouts. Solar systems keep running.

Next earnings report is Feb 25. Sales forecasted to rise 20% in Q4 2020 with guidance for 2021 increasing above that (hard to tell what guidance is since the merger). I am looking at solar so trying to pick one of the biggest companies with a track record.

Downsides: Solar is still expensive to install despite some systems with great paybacks. The company preguided Q4 results which looked good but also announced a $350 senior convertible debt offering. I don't know if the stock dropped because of teh convertibles or the results but it fell from around $100 to $70. I would welcome any more insight here.

So I am getting more into stock investment and I have a couple of questions.

I understand that when a company goes public, this is a time where they raise money by selling shares to people.

I understand that afterwards their shares (which they sold) can be later resold/traded by the folks that initially bought them. I believe this trading of the shares is the economic activities we see on the stock exchange. And these economic actvities lead to things like price appreciation of the stock.

My question now, is, does the company enjoy any monetary benefit from their stock appreciating? My guess is not. I do not think price appreciation for instance provides any extra funds for the company to run their operation. I think the stock price is disconnected in that sense. 

Is this right? If so, how then, if any does a company benefit from their stock appreciating (or is hurt by their stock price depreciating)_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ [HELP] SWITCHING FROM DIVIDENDS TO GROWTH. GOOD IDEA?

I plan on holding all of my portfolio securities for a long time.

Posting this here as a discussion in hopes that others may benefit from thoughts as well._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Thoughts on selling LUKOY? I own 49 shares at a cost basis around 40. I bought the shares in January 2015 and it's been a pretty solid dividend earner. 

I'm trying to eliminate my exposure to oil and gas and was thinking about selling this off. Being a Russian investment, it also has the slight air of corruption there too.

Any thoughts one way or another?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Cash Alternatives Purchase? MMDA1 Alternatives Purchase? What does this mean? I uploaded $50 onto TF Ameritrade to invest in some stock for the first time. (I have absolutely no solid grasp on how all of this works. )


I uploaded the funds on the 4th of February, and it’s showing on the 5th of February, “Cash Alternatives Purchase & MMDA1 Alternatives Purchase.” 

The funds ($50)  have been cleared from my bank account as of the 5th as well. 

I’m asking what do those terms mean, and when will I be able to buy=trade?  This is all very confusing to me. 

Please help me out! All advice will be taken seriously! ❤️_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ All this talk of rockets lately..... RKT seems under valued to me. 
It seems to jump up and then back down fairly quickly, thinking of adding to position and looking for reasons it might be a bad idea. 
Why SHOULDN’T I buy more?

How do, interest rates, possible inflation or other factors affect their business? 

Is their an effective way to ‘value’ the stock price? 
(What I mean by this: a REIT owns physical property and you could add up the value of that-debt and the stock is essentially worth that divided by number of shares, sorta of....)._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ The plan going into this week Going into this week I still have two open positions I'm carrying over:

$SRNE long stock @ $13.98

$RIG Covered call ($3.32 stock - $0.18 Feb12call)

$ITRM long stock at $1.49

Anticipating $SRNE to continue to climb and trading in and out on the way up. $RIG I'm expecting to go sideways through the week barring any major news in the oil industry and closing out on EXP day. $ITRM I'm carrying a negative position on since early last week, just not willing to take the loss on it. Hoping to sell close to break even this week.

Watching a few other tickers:

CEL - Foreign cell provider that got hit with a material agreement violation a few weeks ago and may be nearing a bottom.

BSQR - FinTech software company, they had a huge shooting star pattern on Friday, the chart looks interesting and options on the 19Feb show a ton of open interest around $5/share

$POWW - Ammo inc. Has earnings coming up and planning on taking advantage of the pop. So far they've released really good guidance, looking to enter a long stock or possibly cash secured put position early this week.

I'll follow up at the end of the week to let y'all know how it goes! Let me know if you have any other ideas I can look into before the open tomorrow._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Looking at QQQJ inclusion of stock removed from QQQ Question about QQQJ

So this is a new ETF the has the Next 100 stocks in Nasdaq compared to QQQ.

My question is if a stock is kicked out of QQQ does it go into QQQJ or it has separate criteria?

I’m wondering if anyone else has looked into this?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_
