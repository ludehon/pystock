 I need my money, which stocks should I sell? I use Stash to save money that I don’t immediately need in the form of various stock investments and a few in particular are returning significantly more than others. 

I am going to need the money in the near future and I was wondering whether the best option would be to withdraw a proportionately small amount from each investment, withdraw only from high-returns, or just completely pull out of the low-returns.

Read this artickle from Bloomberg with the same name as this post. What do you rate the chances that the SEC manages to delist companies like $NIO and other chinese companies listed in the USA.

Feedback much appreciated._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ After the market started to recover in late March, when did you realize that this was not a "dead cat bounce" and start buying again and why? As we are approaching the end of the year with record highs, it is funny to think back to how this subreddit was after the recovery started in late March. I remember all throughout late March, April, and even into May and June; many people here were saying that the recovery was "just a dead cat bounce" and "don't buy because it will retest its lows". Obviously that never happened and instead we enjoyed an incredible bull run.

So, I was curious when everybody gave up on the "dead cat bounce" occurring and started buying stocks again and what caused you to start buying again?

I was pretty inexperienced at the time so even though my gut was telling me that I should be buying, I initially listened to the people here saying to wait because it was a dead cat bounce. Around the end of April, I finally stopped listening to all of the "dead cat bounce" posts and started buying again since it seemed silly to try to fight the fed. I'm now up 64% so I'm very happy that I started buying again by late April, but I could have been up significantly more if I would have listened to my gut and kept buying in late March/early April.

* Specifically, the General Services Administration said it will release funds to help the Biden administration transition into office, Wells Fargo (WFC 28.60, +2.30, +8.8%) was double upgraded to Outperform from Underperform at Raymond James, and numerous retailers reported better-than-expected earnings reports. 
* Dollar Tree (DLTR 111.35, +13.74, +14.1%) shares rose 14% following its earnings results, but truthfully, most of the earnings reactions weren't that great since the news may have already been priced in.

The U.K. government has systematically failed to provide transparency regarding the scope and nature of its partnership with U.S.-based surveillance and data analytics company Palantir, [a joint investigation](https://www.privacyinternational.org/report/4271/all-roads-lead-palantir) from digital rights groups Privacy International and No Tech For Tyrants has found. 

[In the report](https://www.privacyinternational.org/sites/default/files/2020-10/V4.5%20Final%20Palantir%20NT4T%20PI%20report%20cover%20corrected.pdf), published in late October, the watchdogs accuse the U.K. government of effectively stonewalling their attempts to access more information regarding contracts between the controversial firm and a number of government branches, including the Cabinet Office, Ministry of Defence, and police. Out of 11 Freedom of Information requests sent by the two organizations, the government has only responded to four in which they confirm the existence of contracts with Palantir but  provide few details of what they actually entail.

“Palantir’s growing role in a range of UK government bodies, coupled with a lack of transparency from the government on what this role entails, means Palantir will have increasing access to data about people living in the UK, and the power to shape the processing and analysis of this data, with no accountability to the public,” they write in the report. “In other words, we often do not know what, if any, safeguards are in place to protect our data, and ensure that it is not misused.”  

A lack of transparency is always problematic when governments decide to join forces with the private sector—this is especially the case with Palantir. 

In the U.S.,  Palantir’s software has been [weaponized to target vulnerable communities.](https://www.vice.com/en/article/k7eqwe/im-a-mother-of-four-palantirs-tech-helped-put-me-in-an-ice-detention-center) The company has close ties to the [US Department of Defence (DOD),](https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/27/palantir-army-contract-dcgs-a/) numerous intelligence agencies including [the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA),](https://theintercept.com/2017/02/22/how-peter-thiels-palantir-helped-the-nsa-spy-on-the-whole-world/) and perhaps most infamously, [U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).](https://www.vice.com/en/article/pkeg99/palantirs-ceo-finally-admits-to-helping-ice-deport-undocumented-immigrants) Last August, [Palantir’s Falcon software played a critical role](https://www.vice.com/en/article/9kegq8/activists-explain-how-palantirs-tech-is-used-in-ice-raids) in a massive ICE raid targeting factories across Mississippi that led to the arrest of 680 undocument workers. Just a month before the raid, [Motherboard obtained a user manual](https://www.vice.com/en/article/9kx4z8/revealed-this-is-palantirs-top-secret-user-manual-for-cops) for the company’s Gotham software revealing how it is used by law enforcement to surveil and track people. And, to put the cherry on top, [Palantir’s CEO doesn’t really seem to care](https://www.vice.com/en/article/gyzgnm/palantirs-ceo-is-fine-with-the-horrible-things-his-company-does) that his company has done some pretty awful things. 

Given this precedent, it’s alarming that Palantir software is being used by a U.K. security and law enforcement apparatus that in the past has been [accused of human rights violations,](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/09/uk-accused-flouting-human-rights-racialised-war-gangs) [engaged in illegal mass surveillance,](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/uk-surveillance-unlawful-watson-davis) [and inappropriately accessed and profited off citizen’s personal data.](https://www.vice.com/en/article/yp3n3y/uk-police-accessed-civilian-data) Just as recently as this September, [The Guardian revealed](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/sep/17/uk-awards-border-contract-to-firm-criticised-over-role-in-us-deportations) that the government had contracted Palantir to manage the country’s post-Brexit border and customs data. 

“Given Palantir’s track record, understanding the technology infrastructure created by their partnership with the UK government is incredibly important,” Matt Mahmoudi, a member of [No Tech for Tyrants](https://notechfortyrants.org/) and one of the authors of the report, told Motherboard over the phone. “I think there’s a very legitimitate fear that this infrastructure could be used to monitor and target vulnerable people domestically, or to offensively keep them at bay at the UK’s borders.” 

The little that is publicly known is that Palantir has in the past at least signed contracts with: [the Cabinet Office,](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2018/12/09/peter-thiels-invasive-palantir-push-ramp-secretive-uk-government/) [the Ministry of Defence,](https://tech.newstatesman.com/cloud/peter-thiel-palantir-mod-contracts-2) [some UK police departments,](https://www.libertyhumanrights.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/LIB-11-Predictive-Policing-Report-WEB.pdf) and [the National Health Service](https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/21/21230453/palantir-coronavirus-trump-contract-peter-thiel-tracking-hhs-protect-now). Yet, despite the fact that government departments are [required by UK law](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2015/102/regulation/50/made) (with some exceptions) to publish details of contracts within thirty days of awarding them, little to nothing is known about what they actually entail. 

Out of these contracts, just two between the NHS and Palantir for the use of its Foundry data management software have been released publically. [The first](https://cdn-prod.opendemocracy.net/media/documents/Palantir_Agreements.pdf) was only [posted hours before legal proceedings from Open Democracy were set to begin.](https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/under-pressure-uk-government-releases-nhs-covid-data-deals-big-tech/) As pointed out in the report from PI and No Tech for Tyrants, in this initial contract Palantir is problematically granted permission to process data that “includes, but is not limited to \[…\] personal details (including gender, nationality, place of birth)” and a number of other sensitive attributes, such as race, political affiliations, religious beliefs, and physical or mental health condition. Palantir also only charged the NHS £1 ($1.29) for using the software in the initial contract. 

For Palantir’s contracts with the other departments and branches, we largely don’t know the specifics of what type of data is being used and for what purposes. 

“One of my initial concerns with these contracts is what kind of personal data Palantir is being provided,” Quito Tsui, a human rights researcher and author of the report, told Motherboard. “In other words, the actual named categories. Are they getting data about nationality, race, ethnic origin, anything from asylum seekers? I think it’s clear from the US that data processed by Palantir is being used in very contentious ways on very vulnerable populations. So, even if there are some data protections, like anonymization for example, I’m still concerned about how aggregate data concerning categories such as nationality are being analyzed.” 

Palantir did not respond to Motherboard’s request for comment. 

Palantir’s Director of Privacy and Civil Liberties Courtney Bowman did, however, send a letter to Privacy International listing a set of objections to the report’s findings. Today, Privacy International uploaded an amended version of their report that includes both Palantir’s letter and their response. The letter is [similar to others Palantir has sent to rights watchdogs](https://www.vice.com/en/article/qj4y9q/palantir-admits-to-helping-ice-deport-immigrants-while-trying-to-prove-it-doesnt) in that it effectively nitpicks some of the report’s terminology without actually providing any substantive response to its main premise: that both they and the U.K. government have provided little meaningful transparency regarding what their partnership actually entails. 

Palantir continually emphasizes (both in this letter and [other public responses to privacy criticisms](https://privacyinternational.org/long-read/3751/sort-trust-verify-palantir-responds-questions-about-its-work-nhs)), for example, that under Europe's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) it’s classified [as a “data processor](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/controllers-and-processors/what-are-controllers-and-processors/#:~:text=The%20GDPR%20defines%20a%20processor,controller%20and%20under%20their%20authority.)”, meaning that it handles data at the discretion and instruction of the “data controller”—in this case the relevant government department—and that this data always remains the intellectual property of the controller. 

It is true that legally Palantir is a data processor, but that doesn’t mean that the firm doesn’t seek to gain from the data they’re processing. That data,  Privacy International and No Tech For Tyrants write in their response, “\[…\] could enable Palantir to experiment with, learn from, and improve the product’s ability to integrate with multifarious AI models, and to apply data transformation and normalisations in different ways.” 

In the few Palantir contracts that have been made publicly available, the company has consistently used “improvement clauses” that essentially allow the firm to train their algorithms and statistical models on customer usage data. For example, [in a 2019 contract](https://www.foiaonline.gov/foiaonline/action/public/submissionDetails?trackingNumber=DON-NAVY-2019-009066&type=requestaccessed) with the United States Department of Defense cited in the report, Palantir is granted access to collect “analytics, statistics, metrics, or other usage data related to the Customer’s use of the Products \[…\] to monitor, analyze, maintain, and improve the Products.” 

Palantir’s letter argues that it is not “a largely ‘black box’ technology provider” because the report cites “numerous sources \[…\] all offering extensive details on Palantir software capabilities, uses, and customers.” The reality is that much of what is known about Palantir has come from the persistent work of activists, journalists, researchers, and watchdogs. Much of this information has not been quickly handed over by government authorities, but rather painstakingly pried from their hands. 

“The big word that has to be repeated over and over again here is transparency,” Caitlin Bishop, Campaigns Officer at Privacy International, told Motherboard over Zoom. “It’s incredibly frustrating to have to go through endless bouts with the government to gain access to information that the public is already entitled to. That’s not how the government is supposed to function. We don’t have the ability to actually scrutinize what governments are getting involved in, to know what problems they’re trying to solve, how they’re trying to solve them, and if they are even ‘problems’ in the first place. That is deeply problematic in a democratic society.” 

With [more than double](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-54348456#:~:text=Palantir%20may%20be%20an%20American,Valley%20base%20or%20Denver%20headquarters.) the employees in its London office than either of its two U.S. offices, new contracts with [Europol](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/E-8-2018-002894-ASW_EN.pdf) and some of Europe's [largest corporations,](https://archive.is/gD8jd) and [questionable meetings with top E.U. officials](https://www.euractiv.com/section/data-protection/news/commission-kept-no-records-on-davos-meeting-between-von-der-leyen-and-palantir-ceo/), the continent looks to be fertile ground for a company relentlessly looking to diversify its portfolio. It doesn’t seem like Palantir’s foray into Europe will be ending anytime soon.

I’ve been a part of this sub for a couple months, investing since June. I’m up about 20% overall. Since I’ve started, I’ve learned a ton. Before I started I had no clue about valuations or EBITDAS. However, along the way I’ve made some mistakes, and I continue to make them. For example, when I first started, I bought MGM because I’m a big sports fan and they host the fights (great reason I know😂). Yesterday I sold half of it because the amount of debt they have, and while I stayed in longer because of the BetMGM app, I’m just not sold it will outperform the competitors in the long run. Anyways, today it ran 8%. I’m still very new, and while I’m up, I’m constantly making mistakes. I keep a list of these mistakes so I don’t forget them and learn from them. However, sometimes it’s just draining to think about how much more money I could have made if I invested in certain companies (fuel cell was on my watchlist for months😂).

Am I wrong?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Thinking of dropping my house down payment on index funds, thoughts? So I've been saving up for a house for the last couple of years and then got laid off from my job. They said I would have to at least be employed at a new job for 6 months before I can get approved for a mortgage. Meanwhile my 42k is just kinda sitting there. I was thinking of putting it in index funds during those 6 months so it can grow more and I can get a better house. The thing is, with covid rising and unemployment as well, I'm worried it can suddenly drop. The other thing though, is we all thought that would happen this year with all that's going on in the world and yet it has been one of the biggest bullmarkets ever. I'm a relatively new investor and I've seen many say that we shouldn't use this year as a benchmark for the stock market but at the same time my money is just sitting there gaining a measly interest rate compared to what I could be making in index funds. So what are your thoughts on this plan?

After Merrill's terrible blunder today (and many others in the past 90 days), I'm absolutely switching brokerages.  I really like having my business, personal, and investment accounts all in one place which is why I've put up with Merrill's problems for so long.  

I've always had a relationship with JPMorgan Chase as well, and time and time again I'm finding their interactions and overall experience keep winning me over.  I've been with them for my business and personal credit cards (the only accounts I don't have through BOA) for \~8 years, and they've gone above and beyond with all my needs any I really enjoy the loyalty programs which heavily reward travel, which I do a lot for business.   
To the main question here though, I know I've heard limitations in their trading platform, but I was really curious if anyone could offer their personal review with regard to the experience on their trading platform and personal accounts.  I mean at this point, I'm at the impression that it can't be worse than Merrill.  My needs; trading mostly stocks (not really an options trader), I may trade ETFs occasionally or even leveraged funds occasionally, but it is a rarity for me, I am fairly active trading multiple times a day sometimes and do self manage everyday as well.  I hardly ever use the BOA/Merrill research features, I tend to use my own proffered research sites and tools.

I’m saying this once again just like in my second last post, that it’s completely legal, since the stocks will be in one of my parents’ names.

To the point. I’ll be starting with a sum of about 1500-2000€. Apple and Microsoft will be about 40% of my portfolio. That’s a lot, I get it, but I’m young so I can take risks. I know these examples are quite bad, because they’re gonna be fine for years, but the question is: 

If I have a stock, let’s  say... company X’s stock is 50$. I have three stocks of it so I’ve invested 150$ in the company. If I know the stock will do well in the long-run, is it worth trying to mess around with the timing of selling and buying it back? Like, let’s say I’d be sure company X’s stock would go down since they’re upcoming quarterly report is going to be bad, and their stock would go down from 50$ to 45$. It’d be a small dip in the long run, since company X would do well in the long-run. The problem is, I don’t know what would be the right time to put the money back in, since you cant know the EXACT bottom of the dip. The so called ”buying the dip” might fail because of if it would go more down. Like I said, you can’t know when the dip is over, until the dip is over. Does that make sense? So, imo there’s no need to panic. Just buy and hold to the stock, right? You should just buy more into it if anything.

Did I explain the question clearly. Did I also answer my own question?

The calculation for the same transaction in the “Account” section is correct.

I make my own DD before investing in a company but I have no way to know if my DD is good until after the fact. So, I had this idea of posting it here and the community can discuss the ticker and my DD. I am hoping that I you guys can pick-up on any mistakes that I am not aware of.

All the data was collected from MarketWatch, SeekingAlpha and YahooFinance. 

&#x200B;

So, Element Solutions (**$ESI**) is a specialty chemicals production corporation formerly known as  Platform Specialty Products Corporation (changed the name in 2019). They own several business brands: MacDermid, Compugraphics, Fernox, alpha and Kester.

The company does business all over the world (EUA, South America, Europe, Asia) and has reach to a many key markets:

&#x200B;

* Automotive
* Computing & Telecom
* Consumer Goods
* Energy & Resources
* Military, Aerospacial & Medical
* Mobile & Wearables
* Printed Packing
* Water Treatment

I won't go over them in detail, just a few key point:

**Automotive**

According to their website, their automotive initiative ESI:Automotive includes **EV/Powertrain**, **Safety systems (ADAS)**, Lightweight, Interior and Exterior. 

Their EV/Powertrain business is directed at Battery management systems and inverter solutions. 

The Safety systems (ADAS) include sensors, cameras, **Lidar**, central computer and conectivity. 

The remaining divisions are mainly for improved materials, displays, touchscreens, etc.

Also according to them the ESI:automotive has **more than 1400 active patents**.

&#x200B;

**Computing & Telecom**

They throw a lot of big words around: Big data, AI, 5G... but **at the end of the day they supply the materials** to build and operate those systems. Which is fine.

"Specifically developed materials that are utilized in many of the  highest technology processors today."

"High-performance assembly  materials and solders are the conduit of electronic functionality."

&#x200B;

**Consumer Goods** 

As more to do with **aesthetic** and surface solutions, coatings, etc. 

**Energy & Resources**

They deal with oil companies and **solar** companies. 

"The offshore oil industry uses our control fluids to effectively and  safely recover oil from the deepest depths. The photovoltaics industry  utilizes our chemicals and materials to conduct new electrons as soon as  they are created within solar cells."

&#x200B;

**Military, Aerospacial & Medical**

Coatings/shock absorbers for airplanes, circuit metallization and high integrity solders connections for military aplications, semiconductor packaging methods for circuits in medical imaging devices and chemicals that form the circuity of medical eletronics. 

&#x200B;

**Mobile & Wearebles**

"Our printed electronics initiative is helping companies to explore the  **printed electronics market** with our combined product and application  experience spanning circuit metallization, assembly and soldering,  precision coated films, and printed graphics. We represent a strong and  organized front in this new and exciting industry, and are looking  forward to shaping its development in the decades to come." 

Again they throw around big words like 5G, Cloud, streaming,  extended battery life, etc...

&#x200B;

**Printed Packaging**

This area is all about printing those nice, vibrant and appealing packages that catch your eye at the supermarket.

"In the graphics packaging industry, we are a leader in innovation. With **global patents and trademarks**, our research and development drives  flexographic printing forward. Printers turn to us to ensure the  expectations and demands of brand owners are met for every print job  they deliver."

&#x200B;

**Water treatment**

**Manufacture and supply of chemical and filter technology** to diagnose, treat  and protect domestic and commercial heating systems in **markets across  the globe**. 

"Many of our products are award winning and are accredited with  independent approvals for their energy efficient and environmentally  friendly credentials." 

&#x200B;

All in all, this seems like a company that has their fingers in a lot of markets. Some are still growing (EV, Solar energy, semiconductors) and other are more well established (Water treatment, printing packages, Medical) which in my opinion gives them the oportunity to grow and have a nice fail safe cushen if things go south. 

**The numbers**

&#x200B;

|Year|2018|2019|TTM|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Revenues|1,96 B|1,84 B|1,78 B|
|Net Income|(81,5) M|78,9 M|121,2 M|
|EBITDA|411,5 M|400,5 M|390,4 M|

**Market Cap:** 3.34 B                                **Free Cash Flow (2019):** 100.7 M

**P/E:** 29.39

**EPS:** 0.48

All in all, I like these numbers. There might be no substancial growth going on right now, but as the company pointed out in their last earnings, COVID took a tool on their clients, and business has not increased as expected. Nontheless they managed to increase their Net Income (TTM) and maintin a health EBITDA.

This admittedly took me longer than I thought it  would because this company is so weird and shady and honestly, next to impossible to predict. I try anyway. Feel free to jump around the text, I **bolded** main themes so they are easier to find. 

I can't post images here so you can go to the wsb post or the link at the bottom to see images. Disclosure, am long $PLTR.

&#x200B;

* Palantir  Technologies was founded in 2003 and the company offers  a unique and  powerful operating system (OS) to government and  commercial clients
* PLTR  has found its stride in providing  solutions to the US government,  particularly in aiding intelligence,  counter-terrorism, and military
* PLTR provides anti-money laundering and flight operations solutions to commercial clients
* With   \~131 customers today on lumpy deals and limited visibility into future   opportunities, let alone conversion rates, PLTR seems a company with a   binary outcome to us. Will they or won’t they bring more customers on  to  the platform? A single customer add changes the company’s outlook,  and  as a result, valuation, significantly

**Company Background and Summary:**  Palantir’s data /  analytics platform is differentiated with its “full  stack” approach. For  businesses providing a product or service, **a full stack approach means addressing the complete value chain from end-to-end,**   controlling the entire customer experience instead of providing a   partial solution that relies on licensing to, or integrating with,   existing businesses serving the target market. Palantir technology is a   one-stop shop, for now, but they have shown signs of flexibility which   will be key in its growth as a company.

PLTR’s two core platforms include **Gotham** and **Foundry**.

**Gotham:**  Palantir’s first platform, Gotham was built  for government operatives  in defense and intelligence. Gotham enables  end user to identify  patterns within large datasets and enables users to  create and execute  responses.

**Foundry:**  This platform enables organizations to  create a central OS for their  data. Users can integrate with other core  systems and analyze large  datasets in a singular, consolidated platform.  Foundry is primarily  targeted to commercial customers.

Despite  having a low number of customers, once PLTR penetrates the  customer  and becomes a core data platform, thanks to this full-stack  approach  they are able to expand rapidly. Average revenue per customer  (ARPC)  has been growing at a 30% CAGR since 2009, reaching $5.8mm as of  2019.  The top 20 customers have a spend even greater at $23.6mm. This  sort of  revenue per customer growth is indicative of PLTR’s ability to  prove  and expand into new use cases once a customer is onboard. The PLTR   platform addresses a variety of workflows including data management,   integration, app development, security, analytics, supply chain,   enterprise resource planning (ERP,) and the mythical \~AI\~ among others.

The  revenue growth is impressive, with Q3 growth at 52% y/y and full  year  2020 revenue expected to be 44% year-over-year. However, is this   revenue growth sustainable? **There are signs of lower confidence in growth**   – mainly customer count going down from 133 at the end of 2019 to 131   at the end of Q3, weak headcount increase of +2-3% y/y in FY21, and   operating expense decreasing 28% y/y which is a huge number and unusual   for a company in high growth mode.

**Palantir’s Business Model:**  PLTR goes to market with a  direct sales force, with heavy involvement  from senior management in  the early stages. Sales cycles can be long,  with heavy implementation  services required to get customers running.  Sale engineering and pricing  vary on the scope and scale of the  project. PLTR’s business model has  three phases: Acquire, Expand, and  Scale.

Acquire  – PLTR offers short-term pilot deployments of their software  at little  to no cost to attract new customers and further monetize  existing  ones. These pilots lead to initial losses. Customers in the  Acquire  phase are defined as customers who contribute less than $100k in   revenue in a calendar year.

Expand  – This is the phase where PLTR would begin to see an  inflection in  revenue and margin. Customers in this phase are defined as  those  generating more than $100k in revenue in a calendar year, while  having  negative contribution margin throughout the same period.

Scale  – With 95% of revenue coming from existing customers, the  company’s  ability to scale within its base is crucial for its growth  strategy.  Palantir’s system is very sticky, once the software is  installed and  configured, the customer can develop further apps and  software to use  on top of the platform, contributing to further usage.

**Total Addressable Market** (**TAM) opportunity:**  Palantir  estimates their TAM to be $120bn based on their bottoms-up  analysis on  customer spending levels across the commercial and  government sectors.

Company  management believes the core product is applicable to  commercial  customers with more than $500mm in revenue, roughly 6,000  commercial  companies. The management estimated commercial TAM of $56bn,  implying  $9mm per commercial customer. This sort of TAM calculation  signifies  PLTR has penetrated less than 1% of their potential commercial market.

For  government customers, management estimated a $63bn TAM based on  their  assumptions around software and consulting services penetration of  US  and US allied governments. We estimate spend based on Gartner FY24  IT  spend estimates. This sort of TAM calculation signifies PLTR has  penetrated once again less than 1% of their potential government market.

Sell-side  estimates vary from $55bn at Citi, who utilized a top-down   methodology, and $105bn at Goldman based on similar methodology to   Palantir’s estimates. Regardless of methodology, these sort of TAM   levels imply **PLTR has penetrated less than 0.8% – 1.8% of their total market opportunity.** Clearly, there is room to run if management is able to execute effectively and grab more market share.

**Government services:**  Recent strength in the  government segment was primarily due to the  results of a recent lawsuit –  specifically a lawsuit in 2016 against  the US Army that allowed the  army to consider commercially available  products instead of using  strictly custom built software solutions. In  1H20, the US Army  represented 31% of total government revenue vs 16% in  FY 2019. While  PLTR has worked with other government agencies such as  the Dept of  Defense, US FDA, CDC, and NIH, there is still a large  customer  concentration within the US Army. While PLTR has signaled its  attempts  to broaden into other western-allied governments, it is  unclear how much  traction, if any, the company has outside the US  government. Some  government customers have begun to expand into  commercially focused  product such as Foundry, which is a positive theme  for future  cross-selling opportunities.

Government  contract backlog provides some visibility into future  revenue, at  least more visibility when compared to the commercial  segment. PLTR has  indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ)  government contracts  totaling $2.6bn as of 2Q 2020. These are awarded  contracts, but the  funding has yet to be determined and is not  guaranteed. With little  certainty surrounding funding and timing, these  contracts represent  potential upside to our estimates.

**Commercial services:**  In 2016, Palantir launched its  Foundry platform – a centralized data  OS for commercial customers.  Customers can leverage the platform to  manage, filter, and visualize  large datasets. Sustainable growth in the  commercial segment will hinge  on efforts to broaden use cases and  leveraging sales reps to drive top  line growth.

With  ARPC at $5.8mn as of the last 9 months of 2020, PLTR has a  meaningful  opportunity to expand via new use workflows and growth in  users. Sales  cycles and implementation times can be long given PLTR’s  complexity,  but once commercial orgs see and realize the value, spending  growth can  grow at a rapid rate. It is critical that PLTR reduce sales  times and  becomes more efficient in implementation in order to diversify  its  customer base as its largest commercial customer represents greater   than 20% of total commercial revenue.

While  the company has expanded into various industries and use cases  over  the last several years, its customer count remains among the lowest  in  growth software – 131 (including government entities). Today,  product  market fit remains narrow and tailored to specific scenarios or  one-off  situations (table below). The use cases also tend to be  concentrated  around a few industries such as energy, transportation,  financial  services, and healthcare. Near-term visibility in the  commercial  segment remains low and hinges entirely on the execution and  size of a  few contracts per quarter and year.

**Quarterly Earnings recap:**  Palantir put up a strong  3rd quarter in its first quarter as a public  company. There was ongoing  momentum for the government business, as  revenue growth accelerated from  56% last quarter to 68%. Most  impressive, the commercial business grew  35% y/y, up from 17% in 2019.  Total revenue growth accelerated to 52%  y/y, up from 43% last quarter.

The  company also announced efforts to modularize (flexibility around  the  full-stack solution) its Foundry product and to accelerate the pace  of  app development, efforts which will help drive broader product market   fit in the commercial segment and drive more sales. We like these   solutions as it shows Palantir is adapting to the needs of its customers   in order to gain more customers. The full-stack or perhaps a   not-so-full-but-fuller-stack solution capability can be expanded once a   customer is up and running on Foundry. These sorts of efforts will be   crucial in diversifying the customer base.

Adjusted  operating margins improved and were a positive 25%, up from  -49% a  year ago. This healthy margin expansion was primarily due to  greater  efficiencies in acquiring and scaling customers. We expect PLTR  to  generate further operating leverage with a more experienced sales  force  and account management teams.

**PLTR Comparables Trading Multiples:**  Shares are  currently trading 28x/21.3x CY20/CY21 sales estimates.  Post-IPO PLTR was  trading at a discount to peers, now it is trading at a  premium.

This was post-IPO and no longer relevant

For  core comparable companies, we use software companies with high  growth  estimates. For the broader comparable companies, we use a wider  range  of software companies. High growth software companies are  currently  trading at an average of 18.5x 2021 sales and the broader  comparables  market is trading at 18.8x 2021 sales (largely due to  Snowflake).  Palantir is currently trading at 21.3x 2021 sales. Across  every EV /  Sales metric for the next 3 years, PLTR is trading at a  significant  premium over the core comparables, the wider broad  comparables, and the  total of both trading multiples.

However, this premium can be justified, because as we can see **PLTR’s forecasted revenue growth is higher than the comparables estimates**. However, **PLTR also has higher customer concentration and lower revenue visibility** than most of the comparable companies, so this premium is especially risky at current valuation levels.

These  two factors combined: customer concentration + lack of  revenue   visibility (negative) and higher forecasted revenues (positive), does   the stock deserve its premium?

**Valuation:**  We use an Enterprise Value / Free Cash  Flow valuation for this  company. We get a $20 target price which is  based on 37.5x EV/FCF  multiple on 2025E Free Cash Flow of $1.165bn. We  also get $4.44 bn in  2025e revenues. For reference, MS uses a 40x 2025e  FCF, Citi 35x 2026e  FCF, and GS uses a combined DCF and 13.0x revenue  model.

We lay out a range of Bear/Base/Bull cases with the main drivers of the valuation and our Base Case assumptions being:

* Number of **net** customer adds – 5 per year from current 131 customers to 234 customers in 2025
* Avg.   Revenue per Customer growth – 18.8% CAGR in avg. revenue per customer.   From estimated $8mm/cust in 2020 to $19mm/cust in 2025e
* Gross Margin % – a hefty 82% vs 81% last quarter
* Opex Margin % – a hefty 45% vs 44% last quarter
* Capital Expenditures – continuation of historical very low levels, tech cos usually have low capex
* Free   Cash Flow Multiple – 37.5x which is consistent with other high growth   software data / analytics companies and between the Citi and MS   multiples

For  purposes of establishing a trading range for the stock, here is a  grid  of 2025e revenue scenarios given total customer count and ARPC CAGR. As  you can see, the amount of revenue PLTR is able to squeeze from   customers has a very large effect on the calculation.

Then,  depending on each of these future revenue scenarios, based on   different free cash flow margins and valuation multiples, we get a range   of stock prices. As you can see, for purposes of our Base Case, the  FCF  margin is 26.2%. The multiple and the cash flow margin have an  equally  large effect, with every 1.5x in the multiple adding \~$3 to the  stock  price in the middle range, and every 2.5% in FCF margin  similarly adds  \~$3.

**Key Risks:**  Simply put, there are a lot of unknowns  with this company. This is one  of the most binary companies I have come  across, it will either be a  massive hit or a dud and I attempt to value  it accordingly. This binary  opportunity is primarily because of limited  visibility into this  company’s sales. Palantir targets large-scale  opportunities within  large governments and commercial entities. These  projects have high  costs, long sales cycles, and are incredibly complex.  **A quarter’s earnings hit or miss and yearly growth can depend on a few contracts.**

Customer  concentration and a small base is another risk. Although  PLTR has made  some progress and decreased their total revenue  attributable to the  largest 20 customers from 68% the first 9 months of  2019, to 61% the  first 9 months of 2020, **PLTR has the highest customer concentration among public growth software providers.** A significant decrease in revenue from a top customer can have an adversely large impact on the company.

Competition  is significant. PLTR’s full-stack approach may be  abrasive and put it  at odds with other tech vendors in the data /  analytics space. Some  organizations may see a relationship with PLTR as  too limiting and  would prefer more flexibility to use some of the best  of breed tools  from other software companies outside of PLTR.

Recent  and near-term expected hiring doesn’t inspire confidence in   significant growth. Palantir expects to only grow headcount 4% in FY20   and operating expenses have notably declined, with guidance continuing   this decline.

Palantir  is not a young company, it was founded in 2003. Although PLTR  is now  hitting it’s stride and making significant progress and growth,  the  company has historically generated operating losses and negative  cash  flow. This also ties in with the lack of detailed disclosures from  the  company. In its S-1 (IPO filing) the company provided 6 historical   quarters, but only included the income statement. Without more   information, it is difficult to understand or predict the seasonality of   the business appropriately.

**Key catalysts:**

Increased  commercial adoption is a massive catalyst for PLTR. If the  company is  able to improve adoption by introducing more flexible  workflow  solutions that meet a larger segment of the commercial market,  the  addressable market opportunity is incredible and can be swift. In   addition, improving sales efficiency could drive higher profitability   than we have currently modeled.

The  company is currently profitable with 25% adjusted operating  margins in Q3 2020. Management highlights the release of Apollo, the  continuous  delivery software that powers the Foundry and Gotham  platforms, as the  main driver in these efficiency gains. The  efficiencies generated by  Apollo and more ‘productized’ offering have  resulted a lowered average  implementation time and decrease in the days  it takes to ERP integration going.

**TLDR;**  Company is impossible to predict and is a completely binary play.  Currently offers full-stack solution and I believe the future growth of  company in the commercial sector will depend on being more flexible with  its core products and meeting more use cases. Government is a hard read  and any contract momentum outside of US aren't clear.

Anything worth playing? Are you watching anything?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Apple Stock Still Has Plenty of Upside, Analyst Says. Here’s Why. Apple ￼ stock has traded sideways in recent weeks. Still, a longtime bull sees significant upside for shares.

Pointing to strong product demand and revenue growth for its services segment, Tigress Financial Partners’ Ivan Feinseth maintained a Strong Buy rating on Apple stock (ticker: AAPL) in a note on Monday. He wrote that the company’s most recent quarter featured strong demand for the iPad, Mac, and wearables, while services had a record quarter with help from gains across several of its offerings.

The stock soared to $134.18 at the start of September before falling amid a broader rotation out of tech. In the weeks since the company’s earnings report last month, some analysts have questioned the hype surrounding Apple’s first 5G iPhone, and whether it can push the stock higher.

Though iPhone sales fell during that quarter amid weakness in China, Feinseth expects iPhone growth to pick up in the first quarter of fiscal 2021.

“Tailwinds should continue to build with the ramp-up of sales of the 5G-enabled iPhone 12, the recently announced Apple Watch 6, and its new line of MacBooks with Apple’s first internally produced M1 Processor, which is receiving rave reviews for its speed, capabilities, and reduced production costs,” he wrote.

Feinseth also points to momentum in the App Store, with increasing momentum for Apple Arcade, Apple Music, Apple TV+, and the Apple credit card. He thinks services revenue could exceed $60 billion in the coming 12 months, something he thinks can double in the next few years as penetration improves within its huge base of product users.

“AAPL’s ongoing commitment to return significant cash to shareholders will continue to provide stability in volatile markets and enhance the stock’s total return, “ he wrote. “We believe significant upside in the shares exists from current levels and continue to recommend purchase.”

Apple stock was up 0.2% in premarket trading Tuesday, while S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average futures signaled gains for the broader market.

I decided I would do a comparable analysis of some major names in the EV industry to make sense of the current hype and growth estimates - and no, I will not be including Chargepoint or Workhorse. Given that the EV sector is still in a growth phase, I decided not to use price multiples and instead focused on performance, liquidity, how the street has treated it, how management has treated it, their supply chain and geographic exposure. Here is what I found.

---

#**[1-Year CAGR](https://i.imgur.com/SeGsfvM.png)**


Given the growth phase most of these companies are going through - and the impact of the coronavirus - a 1 year time frame for their CAGR seemed appropriate. Within CAGR I look at some very important fundamentals - Sales, EBIT (Operating Income), Net Income, and Free Cash Flow. Of the Chinese EV companies, Nio is the only one capable of generating net positive CAGR as you can see Xpeng and Li Auto drastically falling behind the rest of the pack. Nio even outperformed its North American competitors, General Motors and Tesla. I chose these two as comps because they are both the biggest competitors internationally against the up and coming Chinese EV companies, and have the potential to even dominate a share of China's EV market should the government allow it. I did not include Nikola in this as they are a pathetic scam in my opinion, but also because all of their numbers were so incredibly negative that it was completely skewing the data sets. So overall here is the ranking of these companies when compared against each other and the average:

1. Nio Inc ($NIO)
2. Tesla Motors ($TSLA)
3. General Motors ($GM)
4. Li Auto ($LI)
5. Xpeng Motors ($XPEV)

---

#**[Analyst Coverage](https://i.imgur.com/w4nIIR3.png)**

Analyst coverage is a very important factor for the majority of investors. Often times upgrades and downgrades can drive stocks for the month and can even act as the fire that lights up the volume of it. There is an expectation that analysts know what they are talking about but do keep in mind there is often a ton of outside influences on their decisions, such as the investment of their firm and political influences. Look more into how Enron extorted brokers for a 100% buy rating. 

Anyways, we see a lot of holds obviously as these companies have very rocky financials for the most part. Tesla and General Motors, having been in the spotlight for much longer and in a grander way, have the highest amount of buy ratings. There is only 1 sell rating across the entire data set and that comes from Tesla, which is expected due to the controversy of its growth and I will not consider it a threat. General Motors has a signifigant amount of Hold ratings due to their volatile past and overall historical decline which they are just now compensating for with a break into the EV market. This is likely to shift bullish in the future as the stock has seen growth as of late. The Chinese stocks are lacking in coverage as they are just now getting the attention of investors internationally, however they all have a significant amount of buy ratings and their coverage is far more positive than their American counterparts on a % of ratings basis. For that, I will rank them higher than Tesla or GM. 

1. Xpeng Motors ($XPEV)
2. Li Auto ($LI)
3. Tesla ($TSLA)
4. Nio Inc ($NIO)
5. General Motors ($GM)

---

#**[YTD Performance](https://i.imgur.com/997gUV2.png)**

These companies are the hottest investments on the market right now, flat out crushing the indices and reaping in rewards for investors. The fear of missing out (FOMO) is a huge factor in these companies and the idea that each of them can be the next industry leader. So far we are seeing each company get an equal share of the hype - driven up or down by their ability to meet the obligations of the market. (ie,. crushing earnings and meeting demand for delivery). NIO has ran laps around the rest of its peers as it was the first to receive such attention and came from the lowest of prices, having plunged to $2 a share in what feels like centuries ago. General Motors has moved the weakest as it is a value play that has been in the game for decades and has other segments it relies upon for growth. Xpeng's massive 40% move today pushed it above Li Auto and has it catching up to Tesla. Whether or not that happens, only time will tell.

1. Nio Inc ($NIO)
2. Tesla Motors ($TSLA)
3. Xpeng Motors ($XPEV)
4. Li Auto ($LI)
5. General Motors ($GM)

---

#**[Short Float](https://i.imgur.com/yTmoymh.png)**

This sector has enough of the market betting against it to make any value investor go pale. However it has not stopped the companies at all, and the bears have been ripped to shreds as seen in the YTD performance. Li Auto has the highest short float at 15% as it is the youngest and smallest of the Chinese EV trio and is still relatively new. Investors often hear about Xpeng or Nio first before they find out about Li Auto so it does not attract the same hype as its counterparts, leaving investors to value it more heavily on its fundamentals which are gutter trash as it is still in its growth stage. The social media war between Elon Musk and his short sellers has seen the short float drop drastically from the double digits to where it currently sits at just over 6%. This is likely to go down in the future as it has been validated in its addition to the S&P 500, showing to investors that it is no longer the shitty growth stock they used to bully it for. General Motors on the other hand has little to no short sellers as it is still in the "old boys club" of stocks. The street favors it much more highly given its massive track record and mega market cap. As these companies gain more in share price and attention, they will most likely get caught in the cross-hairs of sell side analysts more often. 

1. General Motors ($GM)
2. Nio Inc ($NIO)
3. Tesla ($TSLA)
4. Xpeng Motors ($XPEV)
5. Li Auto ($LI)

#**[Margins](https://i.imgur.com/mSIapfl.png)**

Margins are one of the best ways to value a company's operation capabilities, regardless of whether or not it has positive cashflows. In the automotive industry, operating margins are a very important number but often fall flat due to the capital intensity of the industry. Companies such as the ones listed will often have highly negative margins as they are still finding solid ground for their balance sheets and are focused on delivering on their promises to customers and developing a pipeline of sales. 

With that in mind, we need to currently focus on which is the shiniest of the turds as every Chinese EV stock currently has crippling negative operating margins. Despite previous remarks, Li Auto has been shown to have the upper hand on Nio and Xpeng, with a significantly higher gross margin as well as less negative operating and net profit margins. Xpeng has a lot of catching up to do as it has nearly a negative 130% operating margin. General Motors and Tesla still come out on top as they have dealt with these financial issues long long ago. 

1. Tesla ($TSLA)
2. General Motors ($GM)
3. Li Auto ($LI)
4. Nio Inc ($NIO)
5. Xpeng Motors ($XPEV)

---

#**[Liquidity Multiples](https://i.imgur.com/yAcorJo.png)**

Liquidity multiples are not something used often other than Current Ratio, which is the most important of the three in my opinion. The Current Ratio tells you how many times over a company can pay off its current debt with the value of its current assets. The Quick Ratio is what tells you if a company can pay off its current liabilities with its current liquid assets. The Cash Ratio is a spin off of this in which the current liquid assets are replaced with merely cash and cash eqiuvalents. It is far more restrictive and pins the company for a lack of cash on hand which is not exactly fair given the current stage of these companies. 

Anyways, Li Auto has the highest of these margins by a longshot. This is most likely due to its smaller size as companies just starting out will have less assets and liabilities and will show incredibly volatile multiples. Once it achieves a higher valuation this will taper off and most likely join its Chinese counterparts. Tesla and General Motors have the smallest of these ratios as they have much bigger balance sheets and expanded operations. Xpeng and Nio are second best to them as they are just now beginning to enter a valuation phase where it is harder to maintain such a high ratio like Li Autod does. The industry overall has very good ratios however which is a surprise given the financial state it is in. 

1. Li Auto ($LI)
2. Xpeng Motors ($XPEV)
3. Nio Inc ($NIO)
4. Tesla ($TSLA)
5. General Motors ($GM)

---

#**[Leverage](https://i.imgur.com/LWNG0oE.png)**

Financial leverage expands upon the liquidity ratios I mentioned above by comparing assets and capital to the debt. I chose the total amount of each fundamental to accomodate for the difference in growth and size beteen General Motors, Tesla, and the up and coming Chinese EVs, which have much more near-term obligations as they are still growing. 

Nio automatically raises a red flag as its Total Debt / Total Equity is in fact negative, and by a significant amount which implies it has negative shareholders eqiuty. In a realistic world, this would imply Nio is on the brink of being dissolved and that there is a massive liquidity draught from investors fleeing ship. The company has been successful thus far despite this because of how incredibly cheap debt is, and Nio is swimming in it. Should interest rates rise in China or the US, this could destroy the company in the short-term. However with Yellen being brought back into the fight, it is highly unlikely US interest rates will go anywhere anytime soon. 

General Motors has the highest Debt/Equity as it has been on the rocks financially for a while now and has a lot of issues to get through on its massive balance sheet. This is the equivalent to a senior citizen being bound to a wheelchair. Whether or not it can compete with the young and tough Tesla is dependant on their current investment strategy in EV, and if Nikola is anything to go by, I don't think they stand much of a chance unless they get more competant management.

1. Li Auto ($LI)
2. Xpeng Motors ($XPEV)
3. Tesla ($TSLA)
4. General Motors and Nio have tied as they are both equally dog shit in this regard 

---

#**[Institutional Ownership](https://i.imgur.com/N4foBOn.png)**

This helps signify if the street is putting its money where its mouth is, and also shows us where that particular mouth is.  Li Auto has seen investor activity quadruple as funds and ETFs have quickly added it to their holdings. This is set to taper off as it grows and solidifies itself amongst its peers. Meanwhile, funds cannot find the door fast enough as they run far the hell away from General Motors, with 54% selling off as of late. My guess is that the Nikola screw up made the boomers spit out their coffee during the live stream and realized GM's EV potential is dead in the water until further notice. Tesla's lack of institutional ownership can be attributed to funds 1) taking profit, or 2) selling off as TSLA no longer qualifies for their fund and finally 3) Institutions shifting their assets into other EV stocks as Tesla is no longer the only signifigant eqiuty in the basket and there is room for more growth oppurtunity in smaller companies like Nio, which has seen a neat 43% raise in institutional ownership. Funds are getting their feet wet and slowly adjusting to having a position in the Chinese EV market. The Chinese EV market is in fact dominating and Xpeng and Li Auto have both soared as well, due to the recent spike in confidence that the trade war with the US will end under Biden and that renewable energy is the future of China. 

1. Li Auto ($LI)
2. Xpeng Motors ($XPEV)
3. Nio Inc ($NIO)

#**[Geographic Exposure (As % of Revenue)](https://imgur.com/a/OGA9nSc)**

Geographic revenue is pretty rigid right now as the Chinese stocks are landlocked in China. Whether or not Tesla dominates the market in China is everyone's concern right now and when you see that the operating leases of Li, Xpeng and Nio are primarily financed through CCP subsidiaries, you realize China has no interest in foriegn invasion of market share. Tesla may gain some footing, but I think the market will primarily be contested between the three stocks that call it home as they are being funded similar to the US funding the space race with Nasa and Boeing. The 0.4% other is from a supposed revenue stream coming from Macau, of all places. Not sure what to make of that. General Motors has the most diverse revenue geography with 13% of revenue coming from places outside of Asia and the US. Given their signifigance in the broader automotive and industrial industry, this is to be expected. Tesla has focused primarily on the US during its massive growth phase and the incentives raised by those such as California who made it much more attractive to own their products. They are slowly breaking into Hong Kong and Mainland China but are waiting on more interest from the government entities, and as I said above that is not likely going to turn out in their favor enough for it to move markets. Overall I will be ranking them on their diversity of geography.

1. General Motors ($GM)
2. Tesla ($TSLA)
3. Tie for third between the Chinese EVs - Nio, Li, and Xpeng Motors

And last but not least...

#**[Supply Chain Analysis](https://i.imgur.com/o52ruKR.png)**

The supply chain is critical to any corporate infrastructure. A weak link can break the whole chain and having a higher amount of suppliers and customers means less risk if one of them fails to accomodate. 

Given the developments the Chinese EVs are still going through - and considering their funding by government subsidiaries - private and public contractors are not too present in their supply chains. Nio, hower, has 31 suppliers and 7 partners it sources from. This would often be a good indicator, however with the previous liquidity and margin ratios it tells us that they have a huge cash problem if they are losing so much money despite such a signifigant backbone of a supply chain. Verticle integration is certainly out of the picture for Nio anytime soon as they cannot even stand when supported by others. It is currently a free rider and being pushed to its current value by these partners and suppliers - not that this will stop any time soon. Given that they are just now rolling out production, it shows them having 0 customers. Disregard this.

Given the massive networking conglomerate that is GM, they have 441 suppliers and 39 customers - those 39 customers probably being worth trillions in combined market cap. I grabbed these numbers from FactSet as my bloomberg terminal is close to 200 miles away. If you have access to one though and are curious, run the SPLC function on GM and see what you get. 

1. General Motors ($GM) 
2. Tesla ($TSLA)
3. Nio Inc ($NIO)
4. Li Auto ($LI)
5. Xpeng Motors ($XPEV)

---

Do what you will with these numbers and factoids. How you weigh each factor and the ranking of the companies is up to you. Li Auto and General Motors tied for first as they are both the biggest and smallest companies in the basket. NIO is second place and overall I would consider it to be the most level headed choice as it is not too big or too small, not too volatile or too stagnant among other things. I personally have shares in NIO as of $31 and don't regret it, however I don't look to expand my exposure to the sector anytime soon as I'm currently tied up in other investments.

Let’s assume I bought 1000 stock warrants at $2 each (total $2000) with the current common stock price $10 per share and strike price at $20. The expiry date is on 31 Dec 2020. 

On 31 Dec 2020, let’s assume the common stock price increases to $30 per share and I wish to exercise my warrant . 

So my earning is calculated as shown below: 

($30-$20) x 1000 = $ 10,000. 

My questions are: 

1. Do I need to pay cash $20,000 first to convert my warrant stocks to common stocks before I can sell it or I’ll be paid the difference straight. 

2. If  before 31 Dec 2020, the warrant stocks price increased to $3 per share, am I allowed to sell it? 

3. In any case, is my maximum lose possible $2000 being my initial capital ?

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.

The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **"priced in"**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

So when I started looking at stocks one of the things I read about was options. From the basic understanding I have of it, when you buy a call option, you are essentially buying the right to buy a chunk of stock at a pre-set price on a specific closing date. From what I read, it seems like you stay away options unless you REALLY know your stuff and are prepared to lose your investment if the stock price does not reach the buying price by the close date. Needless to say as a new investor this kinda scared me lol.

I decided a couple weeks back to dip my toes in by doing a call options that would not require that big of an upfront investment, so that way if I did not recoup anything I wouldn't be too upset. I decided back on the 11th to buy an option for FTEK. It was the $2.50 call buy for 12/18, and I paid $15 for 1 contract at $.15.

FTEK did pretty well today, and I hope it continues to do so, but I still don't quite understand a couple things. So first is I know that if I decide to exercise my contract and purchase the 100 stocks assuming it stays at or above $2.50, I would need to do so by closing on 12/18 (at least I think that is correct). My first question is when can I actually make that decision? Technically FTEK is already well above $2.50, so could I theoretically exercise my contract to buy the 100 stocks today, or do I have to wait until 12/18?

Also, I have a total return right now of $78 on this. Hypothetically, let's assume the stock doesn't move and 12/18 rolls around. If I choose NOT to buy the 100 stocks, do I lose that $78? Or is that just basically a return of holding onto that contract and converts into buying power in the end?

Sorry for the wall of text, just trying to figure all this out, thanks so much for any help!

EDIT: I decided to sell to close at $3.50. Which means I was able to have a return on investment of $335. I'm perfectly happy with that result for my first ever option.

Here are some quotes off Wikipedia that I think may be similar to what we are experiencing now:

Preclude to the bubble:
Wiki: The 1993 release of Mosaic and subsequent web browsers gave computer users access to the World Wide Web, greatly popularizing use of the Internet

2020: many traders are on Robinhood picking up “meme stocks” and lots of people unemployed, thus an increased interest in trading.

Wiki: At the same time, a decline in interest rates increased the availability of capital.

2020: fed has also decreased interest rates 

The bubble:
Wiki: As a result of these factors, many investors were eager to invest, at any valuation, in any dot-com company, especially if it had one of the Internet-related prefixes or a ".com" suffix in its name.

2020: Kinda different, but if you replace the .com/internet prefixes part with “EV” I think it carries a similar point/situation.

Wiki: At the height of the boom, it was possible for a promising dot-com company to become a public company via an IPO and raise a substantial amount of money even if it had never made a profit—or, in some cases, realized any material revenue

2020: sound familiar? Nikola?

Bursting of the bubble:
Wiki: On January 10, 2000, America Online, led by Steve Case and Ted Leonsis, announced a merger with Time Warner, led by Gerald M. Levin. The merger was the largest to date and was questioned by many analysts.

In February 2000, with the Year 2000 problem no longer a worry, Alan Greenspan announced plans to aggressively raise interest rates, which led to significant stock market volatility as analysts disagreed as to whether or not technology companies would be affected by higher borrowing costs.

On March 20, 2000, Barron's featured a cover article titled "Burning Up; Warning: Internet companies are running out of cash—fast", which predicted the imminent bankruptcy of many Internet companies.This led many people to rethink their investments.

Enron and 9/11 also contributed to the bubble popping.

2020: ?

Some stocks will continue to rise significantly because of global trends. Alternative energy plays seems to be an example.

However, many other stocks like cruises, restaurants, hospitals, etc. will be challenged 

Given this I was wondering what everyone thought about two things.

First. How long will COVID last in your estimation? Will everything be back to normal by Q1 2021 (March?), Q2 2021 (June), Q3 2021 (Sept), or Q4 2021 (December)?

Second, given how long it will take for things to get back to normal, how do you think everything plays out?

For example, if COVID lasts until Q4 2021 does that mean certain companies go bankrupt? Does it mean that certain companies continue to grow? How do you think unemployment would be impacted? Would Biden's team do something special to keep industries solvent? (Like bank loans to airlines or purchase agreements with large manufacturers?)

Anyhow, I welcome your ideas. Case keep rising and the market doesn't even seem to feel it. So perhaps there is something that is misunderstood about when COVID ends how this plays out._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Nio: The Future Looks Bright, Says Analyst Chinese electric-vehicle maker NIO Limited (NIO) surprised the market last week with a Q3 earnings report featuring stronger than expected $667 million in sales and a smaller than expected $154 million loss. One analyst who was not entirely pleased with the results, however, was Deutsche Bank's Edison Yu.

Yu called Nio's revenue numbers only "in-line" and criticized Nio for producing "lower-than-expected gross margin." Despite this, Yu reiterated his "buy" rating on Nio, and raised his price target nearly 50% to $50 as well. Why?

Two words: The future.

Yu observes that Nio's Q3 2020 gross profit margin was only 12.9%, and not the 14.9% that he had hoped for, "mainly due to an absence of regulatory credits, which we thought would be realized during the quarter but instead will flow entirely into 4Q." That's not necessarily a deal-breaker, though, because Yu still does think those improvements in profitability are coming -- just three months later than planned. Nio guided investors to expect a 1% to 1.5% improvement in gross margins in Q4, versus Q3, from its own efforts. This still doesn't get the company all the way to "14.9%," granted. But when you factor in an anticipated $120 million in delayed "regulatory credits" from the government, and add those to the mix, Yu thinks the company's total gross profit margin in Q4 could approach 20%.

Indeed, Yu seems to be banking on a lot of good news in the near future, and the longer-term future as well.

Heading towards the Chinese New Year, Yu says investors can expect "robust monthly delivery volume" driven by demand for Nio's new EC6 electric SUV and the company's 100 kWh battery option. Nio is forecasting Q4 sales "materially ahead of our/consensus estimates," says the analyst, with anywhere from 16,500 to 17,000 cars expected to be delivered in the quarter, versus Yu's guess at 15,000 units, and with revenue similarly higher than predicted.

Production capacity is ramping faster than expected as well, with Nio reaching perhaps 7,500 cars produced per month by January. As the company continues to scale in size, Yu is looking to see Nio produce and deliver as many as 92,500 cars in 2021, while improving its gross margin even past what he expects to see in Q4 -- to greater than 20%. Despite this, the analyst expects Nio to lose money next year -- $1.20 per share's-worth -- just as it will lose money this year.

So why does Yu still like Nio, despite the continued losses? In a nutshell, because he expects Nio to grow into its valuation over time. Sales in 2022, for example, could be up as much as 40% over 2021 figures, justifying (in Yu's view) a valuation of 10 times 2022 sales.

Ultimately, Yu predicts that Nio will emerge as "a major winner in the China auto market by the middle of the decade," and he therefore calls Nio "a must-own stock for growth-oriented and ESG investors." (To watch Yu's track record, click here)

Overall, based on 6 Buys and 3 Holds, the analyst consensus rates NIO a Moderate Buy. However, as a result of NIO's meteoric rise, the average price target, which comes in at $42.93, implies shares could decline by nearly 13% from current levels. (See NIO stock analysis on TipRanks)

He has publicly stated that he wishes to overhaul Middle East foreign policy. Returning to an era of Obamaism in the middle East. An era of military interventionism, and conflict.

He has also publicly stated multiple times that he wishes to ban Fracking. A ban on fracking would do two things. 1 Dramatically increase our reliance on the Middle East for Oil, and 2 it would stop the undermining of the Super Majors market share.

I recently took over my own Roth IRA from my uncle who was helping me. I started at 5k with BABA and AJRD after a couple years I gained about 900 dollars. After I started getting accustomed with E*TRADE, he allowed me to do as I will with it on my own. I followed the trend on reddit doing mediocre research on PLTR and seeing how much hype it was getting. I ended up putting all my eggs in one basket at 350@16.79 and after today I was very pleased. 

Now, I have been very fortunate in that my uncle has been answering all my questions and I have been very receptive to his answers but I would like to get advice from more than just one person before I make any moves. I’ve recently wanted to branch out and extend my portfolio. 

I’ve been eyeing FSR and AYRO. Both because they are in the energy/EV sector that looks promising for the future and they are relatively low priced. 

I don’t have much money to put into my IRA as of right now as I have just purchased our first house with my wife and have an 8 month old. I can manage depositing around 100$ a month to increase my balance and add to stocks this way or I could sell enough of PLTR to allow me to invest in 100 shares of said stocks.

New investor this year. Seems like it's ridiculously easy to make money from the stock market. All I have to do is literally pick any stock that is being hyped up on this subreddit (TSLA, NIO, XPEV, PLTR, etc...) and you are more or less guaranteed absurd returns, more than what people make for a few months at their full time jobs. Unless you dump in tens of thousands on one of these hype stocks, you can make more than a full year salary. It's almost concerning how easy it is. I would even say it's unfair. Why isn't everyone and their mothers doing this?

Edit: I see people mentioning you can lose money from bad stock picks. But the thing is, and I'm just using this subreddit as an example, there are dozens of tickers being hyped up. Just pick one of these tickers, let the hype ride it up, and sell when you see a comfortable gain. No need to be greedy getting every cent out of it.

If I wanted to look at every stock that got a 600% and over gain between 1 week and 12 months, how would I go about finding these stocks? The reason the time frame is so long is cause I want to avoid pump an dumps. I want consistent gains over a long BUT reasonable period of time.

This is just an example, hopefully you get my criteria?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Chinese EV will continue to grow to next year. Here is why. I know some of u thinking about selling Chinese Ev and take a profit, or afraid to get in because of how high the price is, or waiting for a major pullback till you get in.  

I personally think they will continue to grow, and there won't be any major correction anytime soon.  China just signs that RCEP deal. Remember that news that you read a few days ago, You skim over, and were like meh, China bad.? Well, this deal involved like 30% of world GDP, China now can sell their goods to these countries no import duty. Traditionally, Chinese high-tech products have problems selling to other countries because of the political barrier, this barrier is now gone with 30% of the world's economy. As soon as the news breaks out that those Chinese EVs is moving internationally, the stock will jump like crazy. 

&#x200B;

Also, for the next few months, the sales of these EV will continue to look very pretty and continue record-breaking because the news of these companies' stock was skyrocketing, they were all over the headline in Chinese media (me Chinese). These news are basically free advertising and gives these companies internationally recognized corporate imaging. As more and more people heard about these companies, more Chinese investors will jump in and buy the stocks and further pumping the price. Heck My 3rd cousin's middle school teacher's side chick's dad is talking abt getting this stock ffs. China billion people, billion-dollar ready to pour in.

I think this is a great sign along with Biden's appointment of Yellen as the Treasury Secretary.
