Thanks!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Microsoft's acquisition of Mojang (Minecraft) over 6 years later. It's almost 6 years since Microsoft went through with the acquisition of Mojang (creators of Minecraft) for $2.5 billion. 

Gamers were pissed and reception to the buyout was mixed. A lot of people have curious as to why Minecraft (an already big game at the time) was worth $2.5 billion. At the time, Minecraft was already insanely popular and was already the most sold PC game of all time. [Annual revenues have shown over $290m](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/analysis-and-features/built-last-minecraft-model-9788669.html). So why the gigantic inflation of $2.5 billion?

&#x200B;

I will spare you the description of Minecraft as the people who don't know what it is will be in the minority. I think it's important to talk about the concept of what Minecraft was at the time of its creation and how that contributed to its mass following. Minecraft's indie aesthetic and open nature almost allowed the players to create a game that they were looking for. Notch (creator) was very active with the Minecraft community and constantly releasing updates and engaging directly with the players ([This ended up having huge personal consequences for him](http://web.archive.org/web/20140922063257/http://notch.net/2014/09/im-leaving-mojang)). Although this concept is not 100% new, it was the first to really become popular. Notch's openness for Youtube Creators to publish content of them playing his game (something that a lot of developers were against at the time) only increased the reception the game had.

It's common for the video game industry to have games come and go. Hype is a very big thing with video games. So did Microsoft make a $2.5 billion mistake?

As of now, Minecraft has officially topped at 200 million purchases across all their platforms and over 126 million playing monthly. Prices differ per platform but if counted for all platforms at an average of $15 per copy, we can see roughly around $3,000,000,000 revenue.

Outside of the game itself, Minecraft offers a hosted multiplayer model that will let you play with your friends in a hosted cloud-based world. Merchandise is also a huge source of revenue for Minecraft as well. Spinoffs and installation of almost any device have really put Minecraft everywhere.

It's easy to be skeptical over acquisitions this large at the time, but in 2020 Microsoft made an incredibly smart move by purchasing Mojang.

While the dividend was cut to its current level in early 2019, that was done when interest rates had been rising rapidly, and due to fear of runaway borrowing costs if interest rates continued to rise, the company's leadership decided shareholders would receive better value if they used their earnings to deleverage rather than pay dividends.

Since then, the company has been redeeming callable notes with high interest rates, as well as refinancing existing debt at lower interest rates. Interest rates ended up going down rather than up, but it did push the company to address its debt risk.

I would argue that current market conditions are better for LUMN than ever. Historically, during recessions telecommunications companies have performed very well, as their services are needed and paid for regardless. We Additionally, the low interest rate environment helps the company manage their debt load and ensure lower interest expense, boosting earnings. We saw very strong earnings in Q2 despite many other industries being hit very hard.

I think it is very unlikely LUMN cuts their dividend any time soon. If they do, it will probably only be a partial cut rather than a full cut, and be better for shareholders in the long run anyways.

I see LUMN as a solid play for this low interest rate environment. The only other major company I know with a similar yield is XOM, but their dividend is not sustainable, they are experiencing massive losses for the forseeable future.

There is abundant evidence that market participants are far from rational. It simply implies that we can never be sure whether prices are too high or too low." [https://www.pairagraph.com/dialogue/c93c449006c344ce94e6e2e8fbe7aba3](https://www.pairagraph.com/dialogue/c93c449006c344ce94e6e2e8fbe7aba3)

Burton Malkiel discusses the peculiar behavior of markets with Robert Shiller. This part, in particular, is worth highlighting:

**Malkiel**: "The Efficient Market Hypothesis incorporates two fundamental tenets. It first asserts that public information gets reflected in asset prices without delay. If a pharmaceutical company now selling at $20 per share receives approval for a new drug that will give the company a value of $40 tomorrow, the price will move to $40 without delay, not slowly over time.

It is, of course, possible that the full effect of the new information is not immediately obvious to market participants. Some participants may vastly underestimate the significance of the drug, but others may greatly overestimate it. Therefore markets could underreact or overreact to news. The COVID-19 pandemic presents an excellent example of how investor sentiment and the difficulty of predicting the extent and severity of the resulting economic disruption can intensify market volatility. **But it is far from clear that systematic underreaction or overreaction to news presents an arbitrage opportunity promising traders extraordinary gains. It is this aspect of EMH that implies a second, and in my view the most fundamental, tenet of the hypothesis: In an efficient market, no arbitrage opportunities exist.**

EMH does not imply that prices will always be “correct” or that all market participants are always rational. There is abundant evidence that many (perhaps even most) market participants are far from rational. But even if price setting was always determined by rational profit-maximizing investors, prices (which depend on imperfect forecasts) can never be “correct.” They are “wrong” all the time. EMH implies that we can never be sure whether they are too high or too low. And any profits attributable to judgments that are more accurate than the market consensus will not represent unexploited arbitrage possibilities.

In my view the most compelling evidence that our stock markets are extremely efficient is that they are extraordinarily hard to beat. If market prices were generally determined by irrational investors and if it were easy to identify predictable patterns in security returns or exploitable anomalies in security prices, then professional investment managers should be able to beat the market. There is abundant evidence that they do not. Direct tests of the actual returns earned by professionals, who are compensated with strong incentives to outperform, should represent the most compelling evidence of market efficiency.

A true market inefficiency ought to be an exploitable opportunity. If there’s nothing investors can exploit in a systematic way, then it’s very hard to say that information is not being properly incorporated into stock prices and that our stock markets are not remarkably efficient."_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ What will happen to the economy of developing and emerging markets with the credit expansion?

Assuming I just straight up never sell, wouldn’t it make a lot more sense to buy this than just like SPY. Since inception, SPXL is up 1600%, while SPY is only up like 250%(to be fair, the inception was nov 2008). I’ve done some research, and apparently these leveraged etfs don’t replicate their underlying asset very well over time , but I mean it’s 12 years since SPXL was created, and it is doing fine. Anyway, thoughts?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ If there is a major downturn, you will know. If there is a market correction, you will know. Your stop losses will hit, your alerts will hit, your indicators will look upside down, your friends will let you know, your subreddits will let you know.

Asking "when the market will correct or crash", will only flood you with more misinformation to shift through.

I believe part of investing is shifting through the noise of the markets. 

I understand there is anxiety in investments, but pull backs are common and expected._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Where can I find historical returns for different asset classes dating back as far as possible? I'm mainly looking for returns for US Large Cap stocks, Small Cap stocks, and Intermediate Government bonds.

I've been reading some of Bill Bengen's writing on safe withdrawal rates and I would like to replicate his results, as well as try some longer retirement periods than what is provided.

I'm looking for free data (Broke af) going back to 1926 or before if possible. I picked this year because this is the earliest data point that Bengen used._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Renewable energy ETFs down since inception Does anyone here know why ETFs like ICLN and TAN are down since inception? TAN was almost $300 in 2008. What caused such a dramatic fall? Companies going out of business? Lack of faith in the sector? I understand the recession happened, but it was still over $80 in 2011 years later. Is the industry really just now recovering? Was it overhyped that much at inception?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Why is it considered bad to hold long term, diversified ETFs on margin accounts? It seems that the general idea is not to hold long-term, diversified ETFs in a margin account. IBRK is offering up to 140k for 1.53% and then up to 1.4m for 1.03%. A 100% equity ETF pays this yearly in dividend alone and should make atleast 6% in capital gains (if not more). 

Say I have 500k in assets and under 30 years old, why not take out a 200k margin and dump it in a 100% equities, long term ETF? 

Assuming the ETF dips 10% in the first year, I can keep 20k on hand to avoid a margin call? After all, after the first year or two, I should be above the margin call and this should buffer against any volatility._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Teck.B - Thoughts? I'm sitting on teck.B and bought at a much higher than current market price.  Any thoughts on whether I should get out while I can, or hold on for some upturn.  Sadly, its in my TFSA, so if I need to take a loss, it would be best for me to take it this year..._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_
