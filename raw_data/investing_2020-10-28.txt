DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co's (GM.N) Super Cruise once again edged Tesla's (TSLA.O) Autopilot in an evaluation of 17 vehicles equipped with active driving assistance systems (ADAS) by Consumer Reports, the testing organization said on Wednesday.

A Tesla Model Y fitted with Autopilot finished "a distant second," the group said, to a Cadillac CT6 equipped with Super Cruise, which GM is rolling out to more than 20 vehicles - including its new Hummer electric pickup truck - over the next three years.

Safety and insurance researchers have frequently warned of the risks of consumers overestimating ADAS systems' abilities, a misconception increased by some automakers calling their products Autopilot, ProPilot or Co-Pilot.

In 2018, the Cadillac CT6 with Super Cruise scored higher than a Tesla Model 3 with Autopilot, in a Consumer Reports test of just four vehicles equipped with ADAS.

In the latest test, conducted this summer on a track and on public roads, the Cadillac scored 69 points out of a possible 100, while the Tesla scored 57. A Lincoln Corsair equipped with Ford Motor Co's (F.N) Co-Pilot 360 system, finished third with 52.

The critical difference in the Super Cruise system is a driver-facing infrared camera to make sure he or she is paying attention to the road and is ready to take over manual control when necessary, said Kelly Funkhouser, head of connected and automated vehicle testing at Consumer Reports.

The group noted that Autopilot can shut off abruptly in some situations, while Super Cruise did a better job of notifying the driver when the system is disengaging.

In recent European safety testing, a Tesla Model 3 with Autopilot placed sixth out of 10 systems, getting high marks for performance and ability to respond to emergencies, but falling short on its ability to maintain a driver’s focus on the road.

The U.S. is about to report the fastest quarterly growth on record after businesses reopened following pandemic shutdowns and consumers proved resilient.

But the headline number, like the record contraction preceding it, obscures key parts of the story.

 Data due Thursday are forecast to show U.S. gross domestic product surged an annualized 32% in the third quarter, almost double the previous high. That figure will reflect activity switching back on across the country after Covid-19 fears and government stay-at-home orders ground the economy to a halt in April. 

 The eye-popping number, though, fails to capture the fact that the pace of growth has moderated significantly since early in the recovery. Overall economic activity will likely remain below its pre-pandemic level for some time, even though some sectors such as retail sales and housing have made comebacks. 

 In addition, the economy currently faces tough challenges including a fresh surge in new Covid-19 cases, rising long-term unemployment and a lack of additional government stimulus. 

 

The report comes out five days before Election Day. While it’s unclear how much it will help President Donald Trump, especially since more than 69 million Americans have already [voted](https://electproject.github.io/Early-Vote-2020G/index.html), there’s a good chance Trump and his surrogates will highlight the GDP number as evidence of the president’s economic stewardship.

Here are some questions and answers about the report:

### Does this mean GDP has fully recovered?

No. Bloomberg Economics estimates the outsize rebound will still leave the U.S. economy’s size almost 4% below its pre-crisis peak.

Michael Gapen, chief U.S. economist at Barclays Plc, doesn’t expect a full recovery in the level of GDP until the first quarter of 2022.

 

The headline number also overstates the actual change in economic output because it represents an annualized rate -- or what the quarterly change would be if it lasted a full year.

A 32% annualized growth rate would actually be derived from a quarterly increase of about 7.2%. That compares with a 9% decline in the second quarter -- or an annualized contraction of 31.4%.

Before the crisis, the economy was usually growing by a few tenths of a percentage point each quarter, resulting in an annualized pace typically ranging from 2% to 3%.

 

### What’s driving the increase?

A resurgence in consumer spending. Personal consumption is estimated to jump an annualized 38.9% after plummeting 33.2% in the prior period.

Waymo and Daimler Trucks are teaming up on autonomous haulage, aiming to build and sell a production self-driving truck in the US. The collaboration will see Waymo contribute the driverless tech that is powering its Waymo One autonomous ride-hailing program, which recently came out of closed beta in Phoenix, Arizona.

There, members of the program can summon a fully-autonomous Waymo vehicle from their phone, much in the way that they might an Uber or Lyft. Back in 2019, Waymo began offering rides to the public – in closed beta – in autonomous vehicles without a human safety driver in the car; traditionally, that driver would be present at the wheel, to take over in case the system encountered a problem it couldn’t deal with itself.

Now the technology is being applied to much larger vehicles. Waymo has always been upfront about seeing self-driving trucks as part of its future, and the deal with Daimler Trucks North America gives it a heavyweight partner for that vision. Daimler, indeed, is no stranger to the concept, having tested out its own self-driving truck tech all the way back in 2015.


The focus of the collaboration will be the Freightliner Cascadia truck, which will be outfitted with the Waymo Driver platform. It’s a Class 8 vehicle, and already billed as one of the most advanced the Daimler-owned brand offers. It comes as standard with the so-called Detroit Assurance 5.0 suite of active safety tech, including active brake assistance and adaptive cruise control, while lane departure warnings and lane-keeping are optional.


The Waymo Driver, though, will be far more capable than that. The Level 4 system envisaged for the trucks will mean they will be able to handle all driving functions, though not necessarily in every condition: heavy inclement weather, for example, could prove a challenge, though Waymo has been testing in different locations around the US to give its system a taste of alternative climates.

That’s included autonomous truck testing, though as with Waymo’s passenger car partnerships the future always looked likely to involve manufacturing partners rather than an in-house truck. All the same, the path from bold self-driving idea to actual commercial haulage is a tough one, and has claimed several startups hoping to achieve the same. Earlier this year, Starsky Robotics shut down its own self-driving and remote control truck company, with its CEO sharing some cold home truths about the challenges the industry faced.


Waymo and Daimler’s driverless trucks won’t be ready to purchase any time soon, it seems. “The autonomous Freightliner Cascadia truck, equipped with the Waymo Driver, will be available to customers in the U.S. in the coming years,” the two companies say, giving no more specific timeline than that. “Waymo and Daimler Trucks will investigate expansion to other markets and brands in the near future.”_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Pacific Ethanol Strategic Shift from Renewable Fuels to Specialty Alcohols Pacific Ethanol (NASDAQ: PEIX) is a relatively trendy stock, given it recently had its first profitable quarter and saw a subsequent spike in its share price, bringing it out of penny stock territory and into microcap land ($462M). It saw its shares boost in concert with the clean energy bump the last few weeks that I'm assuming we all attribute to markets pricing in a Biden win. It had a seat on the clean energy ride because its stated business focus was " to supply low carbon renewable fuel for the transportation market." ([Link.](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/10/26/2114513/0/en/Pacific-Ethanol-Announces-Strategic-Realignment-to-Focus-on-Specialty-Alcohols-and-Essential-Ingredients-Intent-to-Change-Corporate-Name-Preliminary-Third-Quarter-2020-Results-and-.html))

They announced in the last couple days that they have shifted their strategic focus to "specialty alcohols and essential ingredients used in consumer products, including alcoholic beverages, personal care products, sanitizers, cleaners and pharmaceuticals. "

I assume this is behind the decreased enthusiasm the market has shown by way of its 40% skydiving binge over the last week. 

My question for my fellow bag-holders or possible PEIX watch-listers is, do you think this has long-term viability? I realize the issue shifting focus away from the trendy topic that appears to have gotten it some market love recently. Do you see any future profitability there? Will it be valued anywhere near enough to justify holding it if we bought when it was being valued through a clean energy lens and not a consumer staples lens?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Are 2x or even 3x leveraged ETF like "QLD" and "TQQQ" good for the long term? (20 years out) Hello, I currently invest in QLD (2x leveraged bull NASDAQ-100) and TQQQ (3x) for the long term, but I was wondering what would its returns look like if a really bad crash happened like in the tech bubble in 2000?

 I came across another "Do All Leveraged ETFs Go To Zero?" article shown here: [https://seekingalpha.com/article/4203362-all-leveraged-etfs-go-to-zero](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4203362-all-leveraged-etfs-go-to-zero)

and this article "American Dream ETF (8/20)" shown here:                                          [https://etfpm.com/american-dream-etf-8-20/](https://etfpm.com/american-dream-etf-8-20/)

The first article explains how the TQQQ crash would plummet more than 99.95% and would need 200,000% to recover (basically impossible). I was just wondering if it would be the same fate for QLD. Maybe show a chart of QLD from 1998 to 2020 if possible? 

The second article explains how the TQQQ could potentially be the "American dream" ETF if it continues to have an annual compound of 35+% or more. The article states "Past performance can never guarantee future results, but a continuation of the TQQQ growth rate above would turn $500 into $2 million within 19 years. Even if the TQQQ rate of return falls by half, to 28% annualized, a $500 investment could still reach $2 million in 34 years. Given this extraordinary long-term growth potential, we named TQQQ the “American Dream ETF.” " It's basically the Holy Grail to grow your wealth, and it's a risk I'm willing to take.

A discussion would be nice. I'd like to know anyone's opinion on what they think about this, or if it would even be a good idea or not to hold onto QLD or maybe even SSO (2x leveraged S&P 500) for the long term instead of "TQQQ" as I feel like it would be a lot less risk to it in a bear market.
