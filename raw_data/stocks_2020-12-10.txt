Is the price of ARK ETFs (Ex: ARKK, ARKW) determined by performance of it individual positions held (or) based on the trade volume of the ETF itself?  I'm other words, is ARKK or ARKW's stock price determined by how many are trading the ARKK's and ARKW's (or) is the price or ARKW and ARKK a reflection of how each of the positions that make the ARK ETFs are performing?  I'm assuming the latter, but would like the confirmation please.

Just a few hours later it is over $145. 
This gives the company an insane evaluation. However the global pandemic and great management decisions led to AirBnB getting this high.... And this very reason is why you must stay away, for now. 

AirBnB is driven by renters, homeowners and landlords being able to sublet or rent there rooms for those traveling. Simple as that. The Uber of hotels. In theory. However MANY renters agreements prohibit this type of behavior and more and more municipalities are banning AirBnB because at its root it is unregulated hotels. Regulation is vital in this industry because of customer safety, rights and most importantly lawsuits.  The un-uniform nature of AirBnB might seem appealing at first however it is very likley that by 2030 many regions ban it entirely to both protect the hotel industry and also the consumers. Personally I am a big fan of the AirBnB style but it is a clear future legal nightmare. 

It’s current evaluation is not only inflated but highly risky. While they handled the pandemic better than most traditional recovery stocks they were also given an opportunity (they rightly took advantage of). Under normal circumstances the government’s of many areas almost surely would’ve begun announcing ordances and reviewable of AirBnB months ago but due to the pandemic obviously these are not the e priority. With a company like Facebook being targeted recently tech giants are not safe. 

This is key. Everything is stacked against AirBnB longterm. It is defiantly a good company and now was the PERFECT time to go public but beware, once the ordances pickup AirBnB could very while need to change their entire business model.


This is all speculation. But I will dive a bit into my own personal conspiracy, the money gained by going public
Could very well be used to fund said new business model as they will have more cash on hand then they know what to do with. 

My personal price target is $50-$75 range. Anything above $80 is absurdly risky until we have clarity on the longterm position of the company. This is a good company but this risk needs to be know.

Any advise would be great._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $HYFM Hydrofarm Holdings Group DD Someone else posted that $HYFM had an IPO today so I decided to do some research(i.e. read the prospectus: [https://sec.report/Document/0001104659-20-124456/tm2027341-5\_s1.htm](https://sec.report/Document/0001104659-20-124456/tm2027341-5_s1.htm)). Here's what I found and my thoughts.

$HYFM is a company with a bunch of subsidiaries related to hydroponics products(basically stuff that helps you grow plants in climate controlled environments). They state up front that much of their business is tied in to the growing US/Canadian cannabis industry, but is also used to grow foodstuffs. The company was founded in 1977. They sell everything someone would need to setup a hydroponic farm, including consumables like nutrients and grow medium(meaning repeat customers).

Net sales went from $181mil to $254mil 2019-2020.

Net Income went from -12.4% to positive 0.7% 2019-2020.

Gross profit went from 11.9% to 18.7% 2019-2020.

The company holds $113mil in long term debt.

Quite a bit of debt, but other numbers are trending in the right direction.

Bill Toler is the CEO and joined in 2019. It appears he is helping to turn the company profitable at a pretty decent rate. He claims to be a "veteran of the consumer packaged goods (“CPG”) industry" and has names like Hostess, Nabisco, Campbell Soup, and P&G in his resume going back to the late 1980's.

My opinion: I don't think cannabis is going away anytime soon and I also think that vertical farming will grow significantly in the future because it is more stable, resource efficient and will produce cheaper food. Because the business is not 100% tied to cannabis, they won't shoulder all the same risk related to cannabis regulation/taxation, if that is something you worry about. Cannabis stock has been very in vogue these days, and some see as a new gold rush. If it is a new gold rush, then HYFM is selling the gold pans and pick axes. I think it may be a lower risk bet and may require a longer hold for good returns, but I see a seasoned veteran as CEO who is new to the company and already doing well for them.

Since IPO this morning the stock has held steady around $42-43(just jumped to $46 as I'm about to submit). I don't think it's getting nearly as much attention as the larger tech stocks coming out, but still debuted at twice its initial pricing.

Not sure if anyone else has had the displeasure of using InvestorLine, but I have some warrants that I would like to exercise soon and have no idea how to even get the ball rolling.

There are no resources on the platform to help inform this, waiting times for a phone call with the support team are 2+ hours, and their estimated email reply time is 9 days.

Hoping someone in this forum could direct me on how to get this thing done so I can get out of InvestorLine for good. 

Thanks_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Need help understanding stop limit vs stop I am kind of new to stocks.  In my 40s but putting money away to my RRSP for the last 25 years or so.   I was invested only in Vanguard ETFs and I didn't care what they did.  Then COVID came and as I watched my retirement savings dwindle.  I finally lost my nerve and decided to sell everything when the DOW was at 21.5K.  Live and learn I am still young, relatively speaking.  Yes I was completely foolish and stupid for selling.  I should have got back in when it was 18K.  

Couple of weeks decided to start reading r/stocks and made my first investment in SLS like the guy recommended after reading his DD analysis.  Bought at $10CDN and just go out after 100% gain just now.  I only put in 5K just to see how it went.  Everything else sitting in cash because I thought the market will go down again and have not had the nerve to get back in. 

Anyhow decided that I want to be more involved in the stock market so help understand stop price and stop limit price and how I could use them to my advantage if I ever get lucky enough to have this again.

While we've all heard about this trend following the ANT IPO debacle (the Chinese gov essentially nixed what would have been the biggest listing in history), the WSJ's latest report offers a chilling look at the extent China wants to intervene not only as a regulatory force, but also as a decision maker for business direction. For innovating companies wanting to keep up exponential growth, that seems scary.

Some quotes:

"The state is installing more Communist Party committees in corporate offices and encouraging them to play more assertive roles in decision-making."

"Party committees often trump the decision-making of corporate management and boards."

(On a specific example involving Beijing OriginWater): "Several longtime board members were replaced with appointees approved by the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission, which regulates and holds majority stakes in big state companies, including China Communications Construction. A notice posted on the website of the company’s regulator late last year, when the China Communications Construction subsidiary began acquiring shares in OriginWater, lays out qualifications for project managers. Among them: Candidates must disclose their political affiliations and should have 'unyielding fighting spirit.'"

Thank you for the information_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Newer investors: How to approach hot IPOs for long-term investors With Airbnb set to IPO shortly, I just wanted to share my two cents on how to approach hot IPOs.

&#x200B;

1. **Make a plan:**  As with any investment, you want to make a plan.  Planning helps us to take the emotions out of investing.  It's easy to have the urge to buy more as you see IPO prices rocketing.  However, emotions and IPOs are like oil and water--they simply do not and should not go together.  The first few days/weeks of hot IPOs are typically very volatile, and if you are emotionally investing, it will only stress you out.  I've been burned quite a few times before.   
 Trust me, it's not worth the stress.  Make a plan.  Stick to it.  

2. **How do you structure your plan?**  Well, there are two approaches.  One school of thought will wait until the volatility of the stock price flattens.  The other school of thought will want to open a small position on IPO date and average up or down accordingly.  This all depends on your preference, tolerance, and your belief in the company.  There are obvious pros and cons to both.  If you are uncertain about the stock price compared to the value of the company, it may be best to let the IPO hype fade and buy when the volatility flattens.  However, if you believe that the company's stock is worth more than the IPO price, some investors will start a small position and average up or down.  

3. **If you want to start with a small position:**  Your plan should essentially start with the big picture and work backward.  In other words, have in mind the percentage you want the IPO to be of your total portfolio.  Let's say, for easy number's sake, 100 dollars.  Starting a small position would typically be anywhere from 10-30% of that total number, in this case 10-30 dollars.  From there, you break up your investments as you monitor the stock price until you reach the goal of your total position you wanted the IPO to be in your portfolio.  

4. **Note,** if you are planning to start with a small position and to average up or down moving forward, **you want to make sure the subsequent investments are broken up sufficiently long enough to ensure you are catching the ebbs and flows and, eventually, the flattened volatility of the stock price.**  In other words, if you're breaking up your investments into 33% or 33 dollar intervals over a period of 3 days, that's not really averaging up or down and you will have essentially all-in'd on the stock during its volatile phase.

“They do not have a way to make money long-term,” Trainer said on Yahoo Finance Live just after DoorDash began trading on Wednesday. “There's a lot of competition. And we're seeing their market share decline. At the end of the day, this business is a race to a zero-margin business, because there's really no differentiation... This is Silicon Valley selling public markets an asset at a huge premium, and they're going to laugh all the way to the bank, and I think a lot of individual investors rushing into this are going to lose a lot of money.”

“What $200 per share implies the company will do in the future is improve their margins to 8%, compared to negative 12% now,” Trainer says. “So they're going to go from a negative 12% to a positive 8% margin, while also growing revenue at 40% compounded annually for over a decade. That's super high growth and a huge improvement in margins, two things which almost never happen simultaneously.”

DoorDash has a flashing “buyer beware” line for excited investors right there in its S-1 risk factors section, phrasing that has become standard from hyped tech unicorns in the last few years: “We have a history of net losses, we anticipate increasing expenses in the future, and we may not be able to maintain or increase profitability in the future.”_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $RYCEY - 200% Potential Upside.

This post is directed to all the folks (basically everyone) who said that you should not buy $SNOW IPO, and you should definitely not buy at $250.

When cutting/taking a loss on a stock if you’re already even tax wise (ie won’t receive a refund or pay extra taxes) if you take a $1800 loss (Chinese Starbucks I know 🤦🏽‍♂️) for capital losses, will that documented loss result in receiving a tax refund?

You're a complete and utter fool.  Let's take a look at the issues:

1) No moat at all.  Sure they have 50% market share but there are competitors.  They're a delivery service - anyone can do what they do.  Not only does this pose a risk to market share, but it poses a huge risk to the already thin profit margins.  At some point (because of 2-4 below) they will have to lower their fees and take rate, which will hurt margins even more.

2) No brand value or brand loyalty.  People couldn't care less who delivers their food, as long as it shows up on time and hot.  Early in COVID I was using Skipthedishes until I got frustrated with poor service so I left.  There is nothing to keep customers loyal to DoorDash if someone else offers better service, or the same service at a better price.

3) Restaurants hate them.  DoorDash takes a huge cut, which forces restaurants to raise their prices.  I posted an example yesterday about a sandwich I ordered that was $13.95 on the restaurant's online menu but $18.95 on the DoorDash menu.  Restaurants have been using them out of necessity but they are already finding ways around it.  Many restaurants offer customers incentives for picking up their food.  There are reports of restaurants grouping together and doing their own shared delivery.  There are even reports of enterprising people starting their own local delivery services at lower rates.

4) Future growth will plummet.  People have been using this service out of necessity but DoorDash doesn't provide a service that will permanently change the way people live.  People love eating in restaurants and will flock back to them as soon as it is safe/allowed to do so.  Do you really think that people are going to continue ordering in on weekends through an overpriced delivery service as soon as they can return to restaurants?

5) The CEO reportedly defended the IPO price by saying they priced it at a level they thought fairly reflected the value of the company.  That means the CEO thinks the company is worth \~$100/share.

For example McDonald and Starbuck, their stock is higher than 1 year ago. They are loosing gigantic money during the pandemic, Q2 and Q3 are prolly their worst quarter ever,  or since maybe WW2 (and that's a maybe). Since April they have taken on huge debt in their book, yet their stock price doesn't reflect it. 

A lot of other companies have taken on huge debt too._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Shotspotter $SSTI Hi everyone, 

I'm new to the forum and wanted to gather some thoughts around one of the stocks I hold. The company is called Shotspotter, ticker: SSTI traded on the NASDAQ. It is a gunshot detection company and seems to be the only one that is generating revenue with an actual product out there. 

EV: $377M

Rev: $44M

EBITDA: $8.31M

Today we get earnings from Lululemon, Adobe, Dave & Busters, Costco & more. Let’s talk about this and everything about the stock market**

Hey everyone and Good Morning! So, let’s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw the [Nasdaq COMPOSITE](https://ibb.co/bzmy8C4) drop almost 2% and suffering its biggest loss since October after the 4-day win streak, the broad market [SP500](https://ibb.co/Kw3DKxD) also dropped .80% while the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/9GvPGh5) did much better, down just .35% for the day. We saw a huge spike in the volatility [index](https://ibb.co/RcShWPM) of over 7% closing at the highest level since the 23rd of November.

We saw more companies declining [yesterday](https://ibb.co/YkqyTgh) as finally some stocks have started to move below the moving averages on about average volume for the day.

We saw most of the [sectors](https://ibb.co/Wfn4Trj) in the red yesterday as Tech and Communications suffered the most dropping more than 1% for the day, with small gains being made in just the Industrials, Energy and Materials sectors as Growth companies suffered the most [yesterday](https://ibb.co/5hQKP88), especially the Large-Caps as you can see in this [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/V9bfV71), with all the big FAANG names and other big tech companies being deep in the red as Apple, Amazon, and Netflix dropped more than 2% for the day, while FB, Google and Microsoft also lost over 1%, but the big loser yesterday was Tesla losing 7% for the day.

Today we will get some critical economic [data](https://ibb.co/qnkdTJz), and if this disappoints, we might see another big drop in the stock market, as the jobless claims will start us off in the early morning.

Alongside this economic data, today the [FDA](https://ibb.co/0906d6L) may approve the emergency use of the Pfizer vaccine, that could lead to a vaccine rollout starting next week. This might help the markets have a more positive reaction if the FDA grants the authorization.

One good thing in my opinion is that the most recent [survey](https://ibb.co/5WPhj8B) from the AAII showed a slight decrease in Bullish and Neutral investors while the Bearish camp gained more than 4% in the last week.

Investors had gotten very bullish in the last weeks and this usually is a contrarian indicator, so seeing this small drop is a good thing to see, as I want more and more people to start feeling bearish so I can find and buy stocks at more attractive prices than the current ones. So, the more bearish people get, the more I like to get on and buy stocks. But still… there is to much of a concentration in the bull’s camp so we might have to wait a little, for more fear to appear in the stock market.

Positive indicators also popped up yesterday as Wholesale [invetories](https://ibb.co/WxPPLpS) rose more than expected in October, as this led the Atlanta FED to maintain they’re Q4 GDP [estimates](https://ibb.co/SBZPtZP), while [Goldman](https://ibb.co/sQ42gCg) also thinks the economy will recover faster than expected starting with Q4 and going on next year.

While on the jobs front, October job opening came in [better](https://ibb.co/4VdrTbQ) than expected at over 6,6M, as the job opening rate stood at 6,7% while the quits rate at just 2,2%.

So, DoorDash went live [yesterday](https://ibb.co/LJtbPtH) at 182$ which is insane in my opinion, the current price gives the company a [valuation](https://ibb.co/kcBcpYW) of over $70B, more than 4 times what the company raised at the last private fundraising six months ago. This valuation is higher than Chipotle, Yum Brands, Domino’s and many others from the food industry.

And by the way, don’t forget the stock is [trading](https://ibb.co/CP0Qgbr) at over 30 times sales of this year, which were hugely boosted by the current situation, and that food delivery is really hard for any company, especially one that expects to grow to have a share of more than 50% of the entire world in the sector so that it can justify the current valuation.

One of the biggest gainers from this is SoftBank as they have a big stake in the company. The shares of SoftBank [skyrocketed](https://ibb.co/GnTSqJf) yesterday to new highs in almost two decades. Like almost every time, the biggest gainers in this IPOs are the banks and not us the retail investors.

With the other big [IPO](https://ibb.co/Ld0pMdz) yesterday being C3.ai which also opened way above the IPO price, as investors can’t get enough of this stock’s, I don’t think this is a healthy hype for this type of IPOs, investors expect every new company to just skyrocket but, not all of them will, and paying such a high premium is not worth it most time, better wait for a pullback before getting some action on these stocks.

Today we will see [AirBNB](https://ibb.co/Hxd70Tb) go public, as the valuation for this company also gets higher and higher, as they have started selling shares for 68$ even higher than the latest targeted price between 56-60$. And if DoorDash is any [indication](https://ibb.co/8cb3yTs), I don’t think we will be able to get our hands on this stock below 100$. Way above my 70-80$ max price that I am willing to pay, so I am going to wait this out also until they have a pullback, maybe once the first earnings come out, that will be the case. But if somehow the IPO is under 80$ and especially under 70$ I would be willing to get some action.

Some other [news](https://ibb.co/H4Pxqmq) from the stock market which pushed companies like Facebook lower came in when almost every US state filed a lawsuit against the company. In the long run, if this happens just like with the Google lawsuit, the sum of the parts of the company is bigger than the company itself, so I don’t really have any worries long-term about Facebook or Google, as they are the 2 of the biggest advertising platforms in the world.

While [REAL ESTATE](https://ibb.co/0X85Cb4) is starting to make a small comeback in New York, as leases jumped 30% year over year in November to around 4000 new ones, but it will still take a very long time before things go back to where they stood before this year.

Also, we will have a lot of earnings results today as [Oracle](https://ibb.co/jb5CPPV), Lululemon, Adobe, Dave & Busters, Costco, Broadcom and others report.

I expect [Lululemon](https://ibb.co/J2MBWD2) to beat the estimates and the stock to regain momentum after it has struggled since the beginning of September. And just like analysts from Raymond James [said](https://ibb.co/gFL3T0s), the only underlying story problem for investors it’s the valuation, but this will soon go away, as people will buy this brand even more once the reopening begins.

Likewise, [Dave & Buster's](https://ibb.co/L0rY2YS) may have smaller loses than expected last quarter as restaurants weren’t hit so badly like before or like this quarter.

While [BROADCOM](https://ibb.co/b5kYKLB) stands to benefit a lot from the recent move in semiconductor industry especially for data centers that stands to benefit them a lot.

[COSTCO](https://ibb.co/D19qrSc) will also report earnings after the close, and is expected to show over 14% growth in eps and revenues since last year, as they are one of the best retailers to own as a shareholder, even if they always trade at a premium.

Adobe just released earnings while writing this post and here are the excelent results that the company [posted](https://ibb.co/kyzBLjv). Now let's see how the stock reacts, will it go down or up?

So, guys, don’t forget not to panic sell when you see a big red day in the markets, just look at this Wells Fargo [chart](https://ibb.co/yQwKpt0).

Investors who added 30% more exposure to equities, and took the money from investment-grade fixed income largely outperform the rest of the investors, while the average investor who does a quarterly rebalancing also did very good and is still up over 10% for the year, while investors who reduced the equity exposure by 50% and put that money into fixed income or kept it in cash are up just 2%. With by far the worst results seen in investors who removed all of the exposure to equities, they are down 6% for the year.

Just be patient, trust the companies that you like and keep investing every time you can. In the long-run markets will always go UP & UP.

Thank you!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $SLS IS JUST LIKE $GLSI Goodmorning, this is to all my brothers who want to make some money today!

&#x200B;

I followed $SLS for half a year ago, posted DD here and just waited till this inevitable moment. Yesterday, the madness began and believe me, it's just starting. This company is still EXTREMELY undervalued and $SLS will hit $20 MINIMAL at the end of the year and that's even way too conservative. It's just to show you that anything under $20 a share for $SLS is a BARGAIN.

$GLSI is a sister company of $SLS, because they are specified in the same field: Breast Cancer Medicine. But here is the trick: the medicine of $SLS is WAY more effective than $GLSI's medicine. The Market Cap of $SLS is still 60 Million and that's NOWHERE near their deal with China that's worth 200 MILLION. I haven't even talked about their other extremely effective medicines in their pipeline and that the fear of dilution is gone now, because they just solved all their money problems.

I have researched this company already half a year ago, I know the value of this company and we're nowhere near it. I will hold to at least the end of the year. Don't sell too early, this is a goldmine.

This is an early Christmas present for you guys!

Good luck!

To the people asking me if they should buy more or get a position now (atm price is $18.85), I still believe this is worth at least $20+ MINIMAL. I am holding till at least end of the year, because this is all long-term for me. I don't care about small price movements because I know SLS is still undervalued. With that said, be cautious with your entries. Tomorrow, there could be a small dip if the presentation isn't as great as everyone thinks.

GME is not a question of a business model in the future, it is a question of right now. I understand the need for numbers and figures, I do. Technical and fundamental research is viable and necessary, but one very over looked method of analysis is philosophical. We have seen DD after DD talking about the numbers and the business model. But I want to share some thoughts with you of my logical thinking and would love to see counter points.

**First Let's Recap**

**Pre-Earnings (Aug-Dec)**

Already was running up and then r/wallstreetbets massive hype of a short squeeze and Cohen letters leads to a run-up followed by a sell-off due to overbuying.

**During Earnings (12/7):**

[Earnings Call Transcript](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/12/09/gamestop-gme-q3-2020-earnings-call-transcript/)

The conversation and presentation actually had good content. Their balance sheet looks fantastic; eliminated debt, reduced costs, making changes towards the digital transformation, e-commerce way up, console sales upcoming, new inventory and other positives they didn't even mention like the [Microsoft deal](https://news.microsoft.com/2020/10/08/gamestop-announces-multiyear-strategic-partnership-with-microsoft/). But the stock plummets...why?

There were two pieces of "bad news": "missed revenue" and "shelf offering" which PR blasted in a very negative light taking it completely out of context. Revenue missed was expected, not just because it's GME but because of COVID-19 effects on a retail business.

Revenue: Loss was expected, not just because it's GME but because of COVID-19 effects on a retail business.

Shelf offering: $100M and has two years to be used.

First comment was by Jim Bell: ""However, as a pragmatic matter initiating this program provides us with the maximum flexibility and optionality to further bolster our balance sheet and liquidity position and increase flexibility gives us the ability to leverage opportunities to accelerate our transformational strategies, such as increasing the speed at which we elevate expand our omni-channel strategy while further ensuring minimal disruption from any potential further pandemic impacts around the world."

When asked by William Reuter from BoA. "OK. And then, in terms of the new shelf, you know, I saw that you mentioned general corporate purposes. Would you consider issuing stocks to repay debt under that program?"

George Sherman responded: "No, that's absolutely not the intent. The intent here is to simply optimize flexibility and optionality. Period. There is a lot of unknowns going on in the marketplace with respect to this pandemic, ongoing flex of cases across the world, the impacts on our own businesses."

My thought: It's a defense mechanism to attempt to do one of three things:

1. Help combat against a Cohen takeover
2. Collect profits on their way out because they know a short squeeze is imminent
3. They truly want to use it as they said

My issue with 3 and what they said when asked by William Reuter, is that they have significantly improved the balance sheet and COVID-19 vaccinations have begun, not to mention they are intending on shifting focus on e-commerce, so it just struck me as a very odd reasons for a shelf offer.

Nonetheless, during this call the share price absolutely plummets, but why? We received a lot of good news and two pieces of "bad news". One was expected (revenue loss) and one was addressed during the call (shelf offering). There was no intent on share dilution at least not anytime soon.

My thoughts: Only thing I can think is PR putting a negative spin, but more-so it was the bears using the negative PR to their advantage to drive the price down. $14 was the floor by the end of AH.

**Post Earnings (12/9):**

A war rages over $14 keeping it nearly level the entire day.

My thoughts: Bears expected much lower yet the bulls fought hard. On a bleeding red day where bulls clearly had the disadvantaged portfolios, they were able to support and actually start a small uptrend.

\#WeWantCohen starts trending and Ryan Cohen puts out a [cryptic Tweet](https://twitter.com/ryancohen/status/1336775515101949963).

My thoughts: He is completely dissatisfied with management and their ability to address his concerns outline in the letter. After ER the PR that went out and thoughts on the future of the company could have been beautiful if addressed and pitched correctly. Management did not provide comfort in the eyes of anyone and the stock price reflects that as does the PR.

**What's Next?**

The moment you've all been waiting for. Let's gather some facts.

1. Individuals own 9.87%
2. Cohen (RC) owns 9.98%
3. Michael Burry ( Scion) owns 2.44%
4. GameStop Market Cap $890.11 Million
5. Cohen net worth $600 Million

Cohen could either purchase enough shares to have majority vote or he can outright make an offer to buy the company. So why hasn't he?

There are two current possibilities:

1. He conducts a hostile takeover.
2. He has no plans to conduct a hostile takeover.

Reason 1 probable timing and outcome: If you were about to make a large purchase, wouldn't you want to get it at the best price possible? He's waiting until he feels like we are actually at the floor before making a move. Truthfully, all he has to do is speak. If he even mentions an intent of acquisition the shorts will run and the bulls will pile in triggering the squeeze. **Bulls win**

Reason 2 is interesting because why would he own 10% of a company where he clearly doesn't believe in current management? So, if a hostile takeover isn't the reason, then what is?

I can think of two possibilities:

1. There is already something happening behind the scenes to peacefully put Cohen into a position of power. **Bulls win**
2. He thought being 10% owner would give him a large enough voice to be convincing, when he realized the board does not share his vision, he pulls out. **Bears win**

Now, this is interesting.

Reason 1 seems highly unlikely to me simply due to his tweet today. If there were plans for a peaceful transition of power, I don't think he would add fuel to the fire of bad PR clearly doubting managements skills.

Reason 2 is juicy. Between RC, Scion and Individual investors who all want to see Cohen at the helm, that accounts for 22.29% of the company. If RC pulls out, the rest follow, no bulls left to fight the bears, the institutions pull out and GME becomes a penny stock.

My overall prediction is the **bulls win.** The reason being, I can chart one path to victory for the bears but many paths to victory for the bulls. Also, I do not think we will need to wait until Q4ER to see the squeeze. From each scenario I could think of, Cohen would act sooner rather than later if he intends on purchasing or accumulating enough shares for proxy in order to get the best price possible.

Notice how nothing I said has to do with the future of the business or the business model as a whole? That's because that doesn't matter. Q4 earnings will boost the price high enough for bulls to profit a little and then get out if they don't believe in the company. The overall longevity of the company is a completely different debate.

Feel free to counter-point in the comments.

# AbCellera Business Model

AbCellera provides drug developers with a platform to find antibody candidates for drug research. Its AI-powered full-stack platform searches and analyzes real-world immune system databases to find leads that are subsequently used for clinical R&D. Unlike its competitors, AbCellera operates along the entire value chain from sourcing to the delivery of antibody candidates; this solves the existing problem of either inadequate/outdated discovery approaches or using multiple fragmented solutions (costly and inefficient).

It is important to note what AbCellera is not - a drug developer. Instead, Abcellera lends their technology to pharmaceutical companies, both large and small, in hopes of speeding up discovery times for antibody therapies. This in turn leads to cost savings for the drug developer, quicker times to clinical trials, and faster delivery of medical solutions. They define themselves as the “Operating System for Antibody Discovery”.

It follows then that revenues are project driven - the more programs authorized by drug developers, the more fees Abcellera earns. Abcellera sees long term value in the business to be driven off downstream and royalty payments that are more stable and are a consequence of successful discovery programs. We explore this notion later in the article. To summarize, revenues streams are as follows:

1. Licensing / Research Fees (68% of revenue, 9 months ended September 30, 2020): payments for technology access and performing research
2. Milestone Payments (32% of revenue): downstream payments for clinical/commercial milestones
   1. *We note that only one program to date, LY-CoV555 (Eli Lilly), has resulted in milestone payments*
3. Royalties: royalties on net sales of any approved therapeutics
   1. *As of September 30, 2020, AbCellera has yet to receive any royalties*
   2. *Royalties generally will range from low-single digit for non-COVID targets to mid-teens to mid-twenties for COVID targets*

As of September 30, 2020, AbCellera had 94 discovery programs either completed, in-progress, or under contract, with a few public key partnerships below. Some of AbCellera’s recent, public partnerships are as follows:

*Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY)* \- On March 12, 2020, AbCellera and Lilly announced to co-develop antibody therapies for the treatment of COVID-19, the potential treatment LY-CoV555 accelerated due to Coronavirus Treatment Acceleration Program. As part of the agreement, AbCellera received an upfront payment of $25mn and is entitled to receive an aggregate of up to $29mn of milestone payments. As of September 30, 2020, AbCellera has received $8mn related to LY-CoV555 and is eligible to receive royalties on aggregate sales (including Lilly’s $375mn and $312.5mn contracts with the US government and US Army Contracting Command respectively).

*Invetx* \- On February 23, 2020, AbCellera originally entered a multi-year, multi-target partnership agreement with Invetx. Based on the successful delivery of research programs under the original agreement, the scope of the collaboration has been expanded to include multiple new targets over several years on November 19, 2020.

*Kodiak Sciences (NASDAQ: KOD)*  \- After a successful collaboration in 2016, AbCellera and Kodiak Sciences announced a new partnership on October 29. 2020 to generate therapeutic antibody candidates in ophthalmology.

*IGM Biosciences (NASDAQ: IGMS)* \- AbCellera and IGM Biosciences announced on September 24, 2020, that they have entered into a multi-year, multi-target strategic research collaboration and license agreement to facilitate the discovery and development of novel IgM antibodies.

📷*AbCellera’s solutions to existing challenges.*

📷

*The diagrams above illustrate AbCellera’s partnerships over time; the Company continues to expand partnerships in line with its growth strategy.*

AbCellera’s business strategy (per prospectus) is focused on (i) using the drug discovery platform to unlock new opportunities for therapeutic antibody development; and (ii) allowing partners to access the platform to reduce delays and costs associated with setting up drug discovery capabilities. The firm continues to develop their strategy, building a stronger platform with the idea of higher downstreams royalties negotiated. 📷

*AbCellera’s strategy creates a positive feedback loop through which each round of research program improves the speed and efficiency of the next round of data generation*

# Recent Developments / Company Timeline

1. In March 2020, AbCellera entered into a discovery partnership with Eli Lilly and Company, to perform discovery research for a number of targets for Lilly that will result in antibodies for Lilly to develop and potentially commercialize.
2. In April 2020, AbCellera entered into a multi-year agreement with the Canadian government’s Strategic Innovation Fund, and CAD $175.6mn ($125.6mn) was committed by the Government of Canada, of which >$110mn remains and is intended to be used to build a GMP facility.
3. In June 2020, LY-Cov555 moved to first in-inhuman testing and progressed to Phase 3 clinical trials.
4. In November 2020, LY-CoV555 was granted emergency-use authorization by the FDA and Health Canada. For the nine months ended September 30, 2020, AbCellera received an aggregate of $8.0mn upon the satisfaction of clinical milestones by Lilly.
5. In November 2020, AbCellera acquired Trianni for $90.0mn. Trianni develops transgenic mice that provide a source of fully-human antibodies for therapeutic antibody candidates. Trianni mouse technology will allow AbCellera to generate more high-quality antibodies against difficult targets and improve the speed of the discovery programs, which in turn should create higher leverage when negotiating downstream royalties. In addition to strategic value, Trianni also generates revenues through mouse sales, platform licensing fees and associated downstream milestone payments.

**Defining Bamlanivimab**

While any treatment for COVID-19 is big news for the world community, we’d like to emphasize what LY-CoV555/Bamlanivimab  is not - a vaccine, a cure, or even a recovery aid for COVID-19.

Rather, clinical trials showed a 72% reduction in hospitalization rates within patients that have already been diagnosed with COVID-19. We make an analogy and compare the effect of bamlanivimab to blood clotting - it stops from excessive bleeding (hospitalization) when a wound or blood vessel is burst (diagnosis of COVID-19). For already hospitalized patients, studies have shown little to effect in helping patients recover from the advanced stages of COVID-19. Other clinical trials evaluating Bamlanivimab for the treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19 symptoms and for recovery purposes remain active.

This carries some short and long term implications. Abcellera will likely benefit both in the short and long term if the treatment becomes widely used in hospitals. They may also receive more milestones and royalty payments from governments and drug developers. However, the growth story will deteriorate as vaccines, which are already in federal approval stages, become available. Vaccines, herd immunity and measures to avoid the spread of COVID-19 will reduce growth opportunities for Bamlanivimab to be a continued factor in Abcellera’s growth. Finally, any royalties from the sale of Bamlanivimab remains unknown as no further disclosures have been made to date.

Nonetheless, the drug received US FDA approval, with Eli Lilly inking an agreement to supply the U.S government to provide 300,000 vials to high risk patients.for a sum of $375,000,000, or \~$1,250 a vial. Health Canada has also approved the use of the treatment.

# Competitive Environment

AbCellera’s current market position as a full-stack service provider provides meaningful barriers to entry, with its primary competitors providing services at some point along its value chain. The integrated nature of AbCellera’s services (provides integrated services from start to end), in addition to the nature of its AI-platform (interconnection and scale enable AI to continuously become more efficient) is a competitive advantage.

That being said, the life sciences and biotech platform technology market is highly competitive; technical competitors at different stages of AbCellera’s platform in the following fields are detailed below:

Single-cell screening: Berkeley Lights Inc. *(NASDAQ: BLI)*, HiFiBio Inc., Ligand Pharmaceuticals Inc. *(NASDAQ: LGND)*, and Sphere Fluidics Ltd.

Antibody RepSeq: 10X Genomics Inc. *(NASDAQ: TXG)*, Adaptive Biotechnologies Corp. *(NASDAQ: ADPT)*, *Atreca Inc (NASDAQ: BCEL)*. and Distributed Bio Inc.

Bispecific antibody engineering: Abbvie Inc. *(NYSE:ABBV)*, Genmab A/S, Merus N.V. and Zymeworks Inc. *(NYSE:ZYME)*

Discovery using genetically engineered rodents: Ablexis LLC, Crescendo Biologics Ltd., Harbour Antibodies BV, Kymab Ltd., Ligand Pharmaceuticals Inc *(NASDAQ: LGND)*. and RenBio Inc.

In addition, AbCellera competes with a variety of fee-for-service contract research organizations, in most cases using legacy technologies that would compete with one or more steps in AbCellera’s technology stack. Organizations may also elect to develop their workflows on legacy systems rather than rely on AbCellera’s platform.

# IPO Details

The IPO will be jointly underwritten by Credit Suisse (left lead), Stifel, Berenberg, SVB (healthcare specialist) and BMO Capital Markets.

On Monday December 7 2020, AbCellera said it is offering 23 million shares in the IPO, which is expected to price between $14 to $17 a share. The company could raise as much as $391 million. The pro forma adjusted common shares count after the IPO is \~265.95mn shares. This puts AbCellera at a market capitalization of \~$4.1bn based on $15.5 IPO price.

# Financial Analysis

In this part of our analysis, we will take a deeper dive into the valuation, pro forma financials, capital structure, and go-forward expectations for the business. The below provides a brief overview of the financials. We view the company to be financially healthy, given the low capitalization and limited contractual obligations, supported by continued licensing/research revenue and royalties from LY-CoV555 and other contracts.

**Revenue** has grown at a 109% CAGR since 2014, primarily driven by increased research fees (driven by the number and quality of programs under contract) and milestone fees (AbCellera received its first milestone fee in 2020 from Lilly of $8mn). September 2020 YTD revenue was \~$25mn (\~$30mn pro forma for Trianni acquisition).

**Key Revenue Drivers** in the near term will include milestone payments on existing contracts and royalty payments from Lilly for LY-CoV555. The company is eligible for royalties in low- to mid-teens for aggregate sales below $125mn and mid-teens to mid-twenties on aggregate sales above $125mn. Assuming a 20% royalty on existing US contracts (\~$690mn), this would drive an incremental $137mn of revenue (excluding an additional $21mn available through milestone payments).

We noted that Abcellera will likely move towards a recurring revenue model as the business develops more partnerships and use of their technology is more prevalent (and successful) in the industry. Details of future milestone payments and royalty payments are set out through partnership agreements with the drug developers. While we have no insight into the specifics of these arrangements, we expect more transparency going forward as Abcellera sees continued success in their programs.

**Liquidity** will be bolstered by the equity raise, with the use of proceeds used to continue making investments in R&D, building its business development team and other general corporate purposes. AbCellera has more than $8mn of total future contractual obligations and commitments (as of September 30, 2020), which can be financed through cash on hand or other debt (AbCellera has demonstrated access to bank and private placement debt).

***Capital Structure*** will look significantly different post-IPO; the pro forma adjusted \~265.95mn common shares, includes 23mn IPO shares issue, \~81.2mn convertible preferred shares, and \~7.63mn shares from convertible notes based on $15.5 IPO price. The company also has

* \~13mn common shares reserved for issuance under their current plan, as of September 30, 2020, which shares will cease to be available for issuance at the time their 2020 Plan becomes effective.
* \~21mn common shares to be reserved for future issuance under the 2020 Plan
* 27mn common shares to be reserved for future issuance under our 2020 Employee Share Purchase Plan

As of November 26, 2020, The company currently has a market cap of \~$1.7bn.

Although the goal of the above companies is to discover and develop potential drugs or therapies to satisfy different requirements of the patients, the business model and strategy are very much similar to what AbCellera is aiming to achieve with its IPO. Some of the notable goals are listed below:

* Advance its lead product candidate as well as other potential candidates.
* Leverage its proprietary discovery platform by expanding its library and harnessing the insights and data generated from each research program.
* Build a pipeline of additional drugs in their own fields of expertise.
* Explore and evaluate additional partnerships or collaborations to maximize commercial opportunities.
* Become a market leader in its own field of research.

# The Bottom Line

Our Investment Thesis: we think that AbCellera is well-positioned to grow as a leader in an attractive, lucrative, and fragmented industry, supported by a strong management team and board. As the Company continues to find success, AbCellera will transition from its position today as a company heavily dependent on near-term binary outcomes (reliance on a few partnerships with milestone payments for revenue) to a more stable (royalty cash flows) company with significant upside for growth.

## The Positives:

* World-class management & shareholder support
   * *Experienced executive team with deep experience (STEMCELL, Precision NanoSystems)*
   * *Strong and supportive long-term minority shareholders and experience board*
* Leading industry platform with barriers to entry
   * *Full-stack solution is a unique value proposition vs. its competitors.*
   * *Data generated through discovery partnerships provide the basis for training AI modules that yield new insights into antibody responses; with each research program, the platform becomes more effective and efficient*
   * *Benefits from natural antibody optimization vs “genetically made” antibodies from legacy systems*
* Scalable business with a large addressable market
   * *AI platform and partnership strategy enables organic growth with minimal funding requirements*
   * *In 2019, antibody-based therapeutics accounted for over $140 billion in sales worldwide and represented five of the top 10 selling therapeutics.*
* The business model enables diversified revenue long-term stream
   * *Three pronged revenue stream: research, milestone payments, royalties.*
   * *Revenue to stabilize as therapeutics are approved and come to market (e.g. LY-CoV555)*
* COVID upside
   * *Bamlanivimab (Eli Lilly collaboration, LY-CoV555) approved for treatment by Health Canada and the FDA*
   * *Royalties and future milestone payments to drive near-term revenue growth*

The Risks:

* **Headline Risk:** milestone payments and earnings are dependent on unknown, binary outcomes (excluding royalties).
   * Timing and quantum of LY-Cov555 royalties are unknown, delays or other negative developments would limit near-term upside
   * Lack of transparency - disclosure of partnerships is at the mercy of AbCellera’s customers, with little to no control over public disclosure from partners.
* **Customer Risk:** AbCellera’s revenue stream relies on its partnerships as if it cannot maintain and expand current partnerships or failure to address the needs of customers could impact the market acceptance of the platform.
   * As of September 30, 2020, AbCellera had 94 discovery programs that were either completed, in progress or under contract, including 71 with the potential for milestone and royalty payments.
* **Lack of traction:** Abcellera relies on their technology and partners’ ability to advance a product into clinical development and medical use. Since the launch of their partnership program in 2015, Abcellera has only 1 program lead to clinical milestone payments. If investors are to put a premium on their valuation, Abcellera will need to show rapid adoption of their technology within the industry and successful delivery of therapies to the population.
   * We expect larger, high profile antibody discoveries (through the use of Abcellera’s technology) to receive higher coverage and perhaps prompt drug makers to disclose Abcellera’s involvement.

How would /r/stocks handle it? Set a sell limit order? Hold long? Some combo of the two? [Proof\(?\)](https://imgur.com/a/7k0qjZm)

I am normally a buy and hold investor.

EDIT: Received an email overnight stating that my shares would show up in my MS account "within 24 hours of the IPO date" and if I would like to sell shares I need to call directly. 

So that sucks.

Full text of the email below.

**EDIT 2** I had to call and sit on hold for 20 minutes, but I ended up setting a sell Limit Order of $150, which was exercised almost immediately. So I made my initial investment back plus a small amount and have 18 free shares to let ride and see where it goes. 

For those who gave me grief for not going all in, all I can say is that everything I read in /r/stocks and /r/investing over the last week was fairly negative about ABNB as an investment and the IPO, including when I asked about doing this. I guess I wish all of the naysayers (about my paltry $2500 investment here) had something to say then.

Seeing as I am older than the average redditor, with a mortgage to pay and family to feed, I was not comfortable risking more than I did. 

Do I wish I had gone all in? Yes, of course. Am I happy with my outcome, yes._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Options understanding Am i on the right track of understanding how it works? So basically I buy one Contract of a Tesla call at 555 for Dec 18 at 627 break even price. Current stock price is at 591.  I would start making money if Tesla goes above 627? And lose if it doesn’t reach 627 at least? This contract will also cost me 72 per share, around 7200_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Finding Stock Catalysts Anyone have suggestions for websites or apps, preferably with some sort of alert subscription for hearing about catalysts (FDA approvals, successful trials, IPOs)?

I've been mostly getting my info from users sharing stuff on Reddit, but I think it's time to upgrade. Thanks!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Examples of Real Call Options / Reading Charts I'm new to stocks, so I have a few questions...

Could someone provide an example of buying call options? Can you use the 2 options below and provide an example of a gain/loss scenario for each? I want to know how the calculations are performed for a profit or loss and whether the call option is worth buying.

It's only possible to buy call options that are in "near-money", right? There won't be a call option that is already "in the money" that you can purchase is there? Otherwise, why would everyone not buy it right? 

 Also, if you don't mind explaining what the headers in the columns mean, that'd be appreciated.

TLDR; I want a summary of how the calculations are performed for gain/loss of call options_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Is FAANG + M screwed in medium term? From March bottoms up until august the large cap tech stocks ran up insane amounts due to everyone staying at home and people buying and spending more time on the internet. So many of these stocks ran up an insane amount in such a short period of time, pricing in any medium term future growth. Will these giant tech stocks trade sideways for the next couple years because of this? They’ve been trading sideways since august/September and they have such high valuations._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Why isn’t no one talking about Becton,Dickinson and Company (BDX) Why isn’t anyone talking about BDX ??

https://securitybrief.co.nz/story/blackberry-and-android-partner-up-to-secure-android-11_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ My Watchlist for December 10, 2020 My plays for December 10, 2020,

I use: 10, 50, & 200EMA. MACD, Stochastic, and RSI as indicators - all on the 180D, 4H chart)

**$AGEN** \- This is a down trending stock, do not get this twisted. But the channel down is amazingly structured. It is curling back up; and it has done it 4 times now in this channel. If this holds, this is an easy 5% at least, if not closer to 17%. RSI was recently oversold, Stochastic is finally curling, and the MACD crossed. All adding up for a win tomorrow. 

**$ALNY** \- We have a channel from the last 6 months developing, and at this price point - it has been very successful. $124.00 reversals have had a 100% success rate over 5 times now, but the profits are lower every time. It is coiling for a big move. I would go long if it shows any life tomorrow, easiest 6% - 15% you'll have.

**$BBY** \- This is a strong support area, it has not gotten this low in 4 months, and always hold here. It reversed today so just go long and have a reasonable stop lose. Was oversold, stochastic curled, MACD is finally moving up. Super simple read and play here.

**$BIG** \- $BIG has this channel, $45 to about $43; where it reverses beautifully. Was just oversold, Stochastic bottomed out, and now it is off! If it breaks both 50 and 200EMA lines, it is going to go stuuuuupid.

**$BKI** \- Bouncing off of the 200EMA lines which is also paired with a strong support area. If it bounces you'll see a very clean 11% right here, Oversold as well; such an easy read. here.

**$BLD** \- One of the easiest channels you'll see since $FL last week. 200EMA bounce, support, with a channel?! GO LOOOOONG.

**$COR** \- IF $COR goes from $118 to $117, you win. This channel is that strong, it has not broken this low in months -- and the best moves are 30%, easy. Buy now... Like pre market tomorrow...

**$EXR** \- Suuuuuch a beautiful channel up with such strong success, that is coupled with the 200EMA line. It is also at a support area, and Stochastic looks good for a push. Such an easy read and setup.

**$GALT** \- Read my description of $COR, and apply it to this from $2.60 to $2.53, what a beautiful channel here y'all. 

**$HAS** \- Loooong term ascending trendline, and at a support area here. IF it lives, go long because you'll make easy 8% - 10% on this one. Worst case, it dies and we have a brand new horizontal channel that we can abuse. But Indicators show a time for a reversal here.

**$NEW** \- Step down, channel, step down channel; rinse - wash - repeat. That is what $NEw is doing. This channel though is strong and if it breaks this downtrend, it is going to go mental. This is also a great deal for the price point and potential.

**$RESN** \- Read $COR and $GALT, same thing for a penny stock._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Am I buying the correct types of stocks for my personal & IRAs? I'm in the process of reorganizing/reallocating stocks/funds in my personal account as well as my IRAs.  My thinking is to place long term holds into the IRAs, and short term holdings (1 month - 6 month) as well as a few medium/long term into my personal.  

&#x200B;

For example, I just bought ARKK & ICLN into my IRA and plan to hold those for 5-10 years.  I'm going to buy on the dips on these to add - but I plan on doing so in the IRA.  Riskier stocks (marijuana for example) I plan on buying into my personal - as I don't really want to "play" with IRA money.

&#x200B;

Is this line of thinking correct?  I know taxes play a huge role into what kind of accounts I should be more actively trading in vs holding.  Am I correct in my thinking or do I have things reversed?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ ADBE vs NVDA If you had to pick between these two, which would be a better option? I have the option to utilize fractional shares, but not sure which position is better for mid-long term. (I have a position in NVDA now but contemplating selling and getting ADBE instead). Obviously both are very different companies but they still fall into the tech category._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ What stocks are you consistently buying more of?

Will this be bullish or bearish for TSLA and SPCE? Thoughts? It was just a test flight, i'd be interested to see the market's reaction tomorrow._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ AirBNB...would you buy between 60-65? The WSJ is reporting that Airbnb is expected to price its IPO at either $67 or $68 per share. The American hospitality unicorn raised its IPO price target earlier this week, from $44 to $50 to $56 to $60.

So, lets add a few more dollars and say we are buying at 60-65 to be on the safe side (it jumps immediately)...would you buy at this price? Yes or No?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Where to get an official list of S&P500 constituents I am trying to find an official list of S&P500 companies, I went on S&P's website and they have so many pages but no where obvious where you can see a list of the most up to date S&P500 companies.  What gives? Are they trying to hide it or something???

I can find the lists on third party websites, but they may be out of date.

Any advice or recommendations would be greatly appreciated!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ GLSI I looked over their study. Both the control and experimental group had other treatments, so theres more than 1 variable. Only 10 people in the treatment group had stage 3 or stage 4 cancer. The control had 13 people with stage 3 and stage 4 and ended up with a 90% survival and no reemergence rate.

This does not seem statistically significant especially with how muddy the study is because of all the extra variables. And considering they IPOed recently, its making me wonder if this is a ploy to dump on investors._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_
