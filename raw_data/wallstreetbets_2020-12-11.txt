I am in for almost a year when it was pretty unpopular stock without hype and i did not sell a shit even at ATH or now nor i plan to. Nio maybe mooned on EV hype and shit but fundamentals do not lie. Maybe they do not sell hundred thousands vehicles a year (yet) but they sit on technologies that are far more advanced that any other ev company has done. Battery swaps net that assure you can drive half a china without needed to stop for several hours recharge is so huge and imo it is still not fully priced in. Their expansion to europe is coming and if they are able to build samelike battery swaps stations net in europe its something even unbelievable huge to describe.

What we hate at evs the most and propably why many people still not buy them are that after few hundred miles you gotta waste several hours standing on some shitass gas station recharging battery. So the answer is solid state battery or battery swap stations.

Mark cap now: 50B 

Mark cap if the expansion to europe,compliance with US and improved margin numbers: 500B is not crazy to think of




(Because i was accused of being just bullish)
If they do not comply with US audit, they numbers will be proven to be fake, they will not expand to europe or some other terrible news - it goes to 0$ faster than your wife's boyfriend's balance after you started trading.


Tl;DR 
SHORT TERM: buy puts or short it, idk

For LONGTERM  (and with a little bit of luck):  100C leaps,stocks, whatever u want

Buy calls at high and let it expire😂😂 _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ The difference between an Autist and a Retard, Part 2: Diamond hands, paper hands, and the conviction of an Autist Last Friday, [I posted a little spiel](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k6onxs/the_difference_between_an_autist_and_a_retard/) where I tried to pinpoint the difference between two different types of WSB users: autists and retards. It received a modest number of upvotes and a "rocket like award," but that's not the real reason I'm posting a follow-up. You see, I don't think I got it quite right. 

My argument last week was basically twofold: first, autists base their plays upon a coherent thesis, whereas retards don't. Second, autists form their thesis before the run, while retards wait for confirmation bias to kick in. While I still agree with both of those points, I think there's actually a simpler way to put it: autists have conviction in their plays, and retards don't. 

You might object: what about the retards who diamond-hand wildly OTM options until they expire worthless? Don't they have conviction, albeit of the retarded variety? To which I would respond: retard conviction is not real conviction. It's just a potent example of the [sunk cost fallacy](https://thedecisionlab.com/biases/the-sunk-cost-fallacy/). Confirmation bias, a.k.a. "meme power" or "retard strength" is what leads retards to enter postitions and stay with them when they're winning, and the sunk cost fallacy is what leads retards to stick with losing positions.  Needless to say, the conviction of an autist is different.

An autist's conviction starts with thorough DD. That's an acronym for "due dilligence"--fellow retards take note. Someone else's DD can be a great starting point, but it's essential to actually understand the points that they raise. For your trades to be successful longer-term, you need to internalize the bull (or bear) case for a particular stock as conviction. This is what autists do. 

I'm using the term "autist" here loosely, of course, in a manner particular to WSB. Real-life autists tend to be rigid and inflexible once they adopt a particular position, but that inflexibility is the enemy. This is a dance; I didn't say it would be easy. 

Part of the way you stay flexible and supple is by exploring counterarguments. In the context of WSB, look for posts that have been downvoted to oblivion, and let yourself play devil's advocate for a moment. I often find myself getting caught up in the hype of some particularly sexy DD but then find that confidence crumbling the moment someone brings up something contrary. I then recognize that I hadn't actually bought into the bull case after all, I've simply accepted someone else's authority as fact. Pay attention to that. 

Real conviction means having enough self-confidence to remain open to contradictory data points. It's like life. When contradictory data emerges, you can weigh it against your overall thesis. If the thesis no longer holds, you can close your positions or scale them back without being attached to them emotionally. Retards do not have this capacity. They enter positions for emotional reasons, and they leave them for emotional reasons. That is the enemy. Emotional conviction is retarte conviction. Autists play differently. 

We've mostly talked about the dangers of diamond-handing, but let's discuss the opposite side of the coin: paper hands. Autistic conviction, as opposed to retarted conviction, is the capacity to hold to a position *when data emerges that looks bad on paper but does not invalidate the autist's central thesis.* This is important. Stonks go up, they go down, they go sideways. All kinds of factors affect this day-to-day action, and 90% of them are irrelevant to an autist's thesis. This is where the conventional usage of  "autist" is actually appropriate. Autists have a unique capacity to filter out the noise. It's actually too effective. Again, the WSB autist's ability to remain open to *meaningful* noise is what sets him (or her!) apart. 

The result is that the autist, like Buddha, courses the Middle Way between diamond hands and paper hands, falling into neither extreme. Retards diamond hand and paper hand all the time, and they do both for the same reason: lacking deeper wisdom, they base their decisions upon emotional attachment. 

As Buddha taught, that is the root of suffering. Where the stock market diverges from the immutable law of Dharma is that sometimes stupid decisions can have positive results. Diamond handing weeklies can lead to big gains when a stock skyrockets close to expiration. There are innumerable examples, well documented on these forums. But they are outliers. Your retardation will fuck you over, just as it has fucked me over. Today's 5000% gains can be tomorrow's crushing losses when you apply the same retarted logic to your next play. 

You've been warned, and you've probably got more than you bargained for. Peace out, WSB, and please trade responsibly.

TL;DR: Autists win because their "diamond handing" or "paper handing" is rational; retards lose because it isn't._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $RPRX Nasdaq Notable Friday Option Activity Report _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Watching PLTR the whole damn day. _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ RIP. _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ PLTR🚀 More good news _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Weekend Discussion Thread for the Weekend of December 11, 2020 Your weekend discussion thread.

So you know it and I know it too, this market in general is absolutely absurd and crazy, some people call it a bubble, other people call it priced in, and other people call it free tendies. Right now here is a daily chart of spy

https://preview.redd.it/n19jyt9w8m461.png?width=847&format=png&auto=webp&s=177496ec05c3156a645730d701ef8150ede13916

For the past couple weeks we have been slowly inching higher and higher, but sentiment in the overal market is that we are all greedy and stuff, we are in a bubble yatta yatta gay bears prophesizing the crash that will never come. However, loooking at the 20 SMA(green line) there has been a historical record of price of the spy going down after it touches the green line. This dosent happen all the time like you can see in august and may but 4 out of the 6 times that this has happened spy went on to go down for a few days after touching the green line. Right now we are about to touch that green line, and so far we have been red for a bout 3 days(writing this as of 3 pm on friday idk if we close green now). This leads me to be a little bearish on the overall market. 

&#x200B;

Now for NIO, this stock had a historic run where it constantly kept going up 10 percent every day and was free tendies with the hype of Electrical Vehicles, TSLA was also pumping and stonks only went up. Then PLTR came along and people ditched NIO the chinese EV company and PLTR went on to go massive up same as NIO, and NIO became less and less cool. Memes where spread, and not as many people where hype for NIO and went on to go full retard on PLTR cause tits literally couldn't go up. 

To get a clearer picture of NIO lets take a look at this intresting chart

&#x200B;

[Daily chart from a YouTube video ZipTrader\(not current chart, price rn is around 41.80\)](https://preview.redd.it/1v3zwwhgam461.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=db510d3a5c9b106997376b9d07cc55f03a79c02b)

SO we can see that according to this chart made from some random dude named ZipTrader, NIO price is mostly priced in by hype on NIO itself and EV hype. However you know it and I know it too, EV hype is dying, TSLA is going down, overall market is going down, and NIO hype is also going down. They arent many hot posts on this sub reddit anymore about NIO or pltr cause people tis are currently about to go up. Only hot post I could find was  this one, which will go into my main point.  

[Tesla chart comparable to NIO](https://preview.redd.it/egsp0z4ibm461.png?width=511&format=png&auto=webp&s=9798f3876039a15990d73aad4e61bb9408657c5f)

So with this TSLA chart, on the point that u/sncsoccer pointed out, TSLA went down pretty hard before recovering afterwards. Now why did TSLA Go down in this point and time? My theory was that it was due to a head and shoulders pattern. Looking at the chart he posted, it looks pretty similar to one, but not exactly a head and shoulders. 

[Daily chart of TSLA near early 2020](https://preview.redd.it/43mk7kvbcm461.png?width=857&format=png&auto=webp&s=fe8437e8e704a970e6e594c1102115035dd732e9)

Looking at a better chart here, you can vaguely draw a head and shoulders, and here it worked but tbh this didnt really look too much like a head and shoulders with that left shoulder being so high, but never the less it worked in the scenario. But the real head and shoulders is on NIO. lets take a look at NIO

[NIO daily chart ](https://preview.redd.it/ieyhqj7mcm461.png?width=871&format=png&auto=webp&s=32823eb77a091c55ba17ee062621b248723d5480)

Here is on this NIO chart is almost a perfect example of a head and shoulders, go look on your own at the chart and it will be clear as day. The shoulders, the head, the neck line, everything about it is perfect. Now for those of you who don't know what a head and shoulders are, its basically a bearish indicator where tits will go up and gay bears profit. Now that docent mean NIO has to go down or will go down 100 percent, but its a dam good bet after considering the spy chart, the tsla chart, the loss of hype on EV and NIO, and the bubble that we are in. I am predicting that NIO will go down to at least 40 dollars by the end of next week.

[Yahoo finance says NIO is bearish and detects bearish patterns](https://preview.redd.it/xfofacvqdm461.png?width=1898&format=png&auto=webp&s=2971aec9f9e3456efe335f5efd3260d24e83cdb7)

Even yahoo finance says that this stock is bearish and has said it detected a bearish pattern. This on its own isnt much but when you combine it with everything else I have said maybe it starts to make sense. Also you can see the head and shoulders on NIO clearer here. 

That being said, all of you diamond hand NIO people could still be fine even after this massive drill that I think is going to happen cause just like tsla, NIO will likely recover. However, if you have weekly calls or anything close that, you may be fucked so if I were you id get out while you still could(nothing in this post is financial advise pls don't sue).  

&#x200B;

THE PLAY: NIO puts. I recommend getting something close to the money like the 40.5 put or the 40 put with about 3 weeks of time or more, but these can be a bit over priced right now since the stock is already down about 8 percent. If you are a bit more balsy and going WSB full YOLO mode then you could put money into the 39.5 put or even lower with even less time on the put, however, I recommend taking profits on this type of put very early since I think while it does have a good chance to go lower than 40 dollars, there isn't a guarantee that it will and also in that amount of time. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

TLDR; Puts on NIO, 40 strike 3 weeks of time or more, 39.5 strike put with less time if your feeling balsy. Tits can go up with NIO cause of the head and shoulders pattern on it and overall market is going down, EV Hype is dead, NIO hype is dead, Bubble burst happening soon, GAY bear time

Now, some of you may be familiar with this ticker, and may hold the opinion *“This shit does not move.”* And looking at the chart over the past few years, I’d have a hard time disagreeing with you. 

We’ve been in the $17-$20 range for quite a while now.
 So of course, you may be wondering the following: What’s new, and why the fuck am I reading this bullshit?

#ARK ETFs
The non-retarded among you are familiar with ARK. ARK ETFs, led by Cathie Woods, has over the past 5 years been an absolute fucking money printing machine. She’s been very popular here as of late so I’m sure many of you have read her name in some other DD posts.

 For those who aren’t aware, you can receive reports of recent trades ARK has made: https://ark-funds.com/investor-resources.

Over the past few days, ARKG has bought a large amount of TAK shares, substantially increasing their position (I believe over 1.6 million shares were purchased by ARKG over the past two weeks however I only have the trade reports for 12/9 and 12/10.), and the stock now makes up 1.43% of the ETF. 
https://imgur.com/a/vwHnvE3

Now what is it that ARK sees that the rest of the market doesn’t?

Well, probably this:

https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/takeda-s-says-pipeline-can-push-revenue-to-47-billion-by-2030

https://japantoday.com/category/business/Takeda-says-drug-pipeline-to-lift-sales-to-48-billion-in-next-decade   

(Same as the Reuters article, same journalist is the author.)

#Drug Money = Tendies

Takeda’s new drug pipeline should *explode* revenue, increasing by more than 50% over the next decade. Where is the revenue coming from? 

> “The majority of this revenue growth is expected to come from the company’s Wave 1 pipeline, which includes 12 unique New Molecular Entities (NMEs), representing potential best-in-class/first-in-class therapies, and its existing 14 global brands. Of the Wave 1 programs, five have received Breakthrough Therapy designation and three were granted fast track designation by the US Food and Drug Administration. In addition, one program received designation under the SAKIGAKE Designation System by the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare and another program was the first breakthrough designation granted by the China Food and Drug Administration to a multinational biopharmaceutical company.”

Now some of you may be hesitant. Takeda had some pretty impressive earnings at the beginning of the year and didn’t move from them. Why would the stock move now?

*Because Takeda is explicitly focusing on getting their stock to stop behaving like boomer trash.* 

#Hello Fellow Kids

> “Japan’s biggest drugmaker is trying to turn the spotlight on its growth prospects after its $59 billion takeover of Shire Plc, completed last year. Since the merger, the company’s shares have underperformed domestic and global peers as it focused on selling $10 billion in non-core assets to reduce debt.”

>“One of the questions that we’ve had to ask ourselves is, how can we help our investor base better understand our pipeline, and assume the same energy and enthusiasm that we have?” research and development president Andy Plump said in an online briefing to analysts and media.

>“Takeda’s management is keenly aware of its poor stock performance and would like analysts to take a more bullish view of its pipeline,” Jefferies analyst Stephen Barker wrote in a research note. “But analysts may not be convinced until more data is available.”

Options are incredibly cheap right now and IV is low. Cathie Woods is in on it. The company has rock solid financials and fundamentals and is actively courting investors. Any substantial pop will cause positions to rain tendies. Volume on 1/15/21 $20c is quite high, with 2.6k Volume and 10.9k OI.

Here's an excerpt from a Morningstar report:

"Meanwhile, we expect global uranium demand to rise roughly 40% by 2025, a staggering amount for a commodity that saw next to zero demand growth in the past 10 years. We expect new reactor capacity to drive the strongest uranium demand growth in decades."

"Years of low spot prices have prevented investment in new mines, while existing mines have entered care and maintenance or are near the end of their lives. As such, the mined supply of uranium will struggle to keep pace amid rising demand and falling secondary supplies. Low uranium prices since Fukushima have left the project cupboard bare, and we expect a cumulative supply deficit to emerge by 2023."

"As one of the largest and lowest-cost producers globally with expansion potential, Cameco should benefit meaningfully from higher uranium prices. The company benefits from stellar ore grades, large scale, long life, and an attractive operating cost profile."

[More detailed description I did back in the day here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hcdpox/dd_playing_vxx_and_spy_against_the_fed_repo/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf), but this is the process by which the FED has been giving banks overnight loans so they could make asset purchases.  They used to give these loans to each other, but the process became fucked up and expensive and the FED stepped in to fix this by offering the loans themselves at a low rate.  Once the pandemic hit, they took the unprecedented step of offering the loans with zero additional interest for themselves, basically offering free money.
[‘0 basis points over IOER’ is nerd speak for ‘fucking free money’](https://i.imgur.com/tD780yn.jpg)
**-Did it work?  Yes.**  
Fed Policy typically takes a couple of months to affect the market.  With that in mind, you can see that the performance of SPY correlates with the interest rate and bid volume on overnight repo operations.  Free money policy was instituted in March, and the impact gained full strength in the spring.
[look at this insane Repo activity in early June when the loans were free money. SPY was +7% month to date!](https://i.imgur.com/3bwjqd5.jpg)

**Treasuries** 
I won't go too deep into treasury purchases and its effect on market activity, but the simplified version is this; **if the FED needs to flood the market with money by pushing people to invest in vehicles aside from safe, boomer treasuries, they will buy up the treasuries themselves.**  This raises the price of treasuries by starving the market, thus giving them less yield--in other words, making them less valuable.  With less yield, people turn to stocks.  That's an oversimplified version of how it works, but you get the gist; the FED buys treasuries so people buy stonks.
**-Did it work? Yes**.
Take a look at the yield rate on treasuries here.  [At this time in 2019, the 20 year yield was up as high as 2.2%](https://i.imgur.com/1fLBbE3.jpg).  But, take a look at what happens after March.  The Fed begins buying up the treasuries, and the yield goes down to .98 in April.  All you need to know is that means the yield on treasuries was dogshit so people were pressured to buy stonks.
"How do you know this was the Fed's doing?"
They said it.  [Here is one of many statements from the FED](https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/opolicy/operating_policy_200312a) saying "we are going to by the fuck out of treasuries at an increased rate because of COVID".  How increased?  Take a look at this photo, we are talking about an average of 10 or 20 billion dollars, to 80 million dollars a clip.
[treasury spending increased 3 fold](https://i.imgur.com/J08Av7D.jpg)

**Bond Repurchases**
In March the FED announced they would be buying corporate bonds in another major boost to available liquidity.  Just as SPY got shaky, it was an added boost immeditely after the June  crash (a crash, btw, caused by a change in the repo loan interest rates).  Basically, when large companies need money they issue bonds to shore up cash that are available to the public (same shit as treasuries, basically)--the FED is now buying those bonds.  This direct infusion of cash from the FED is about as close to outright buying stock in companies as you can get.
**Did it work? Yes**. 
See: June rebound.  Also google some of the types of companies they're buying bonds from.  There's a reason why the fact that nobody is paying rent hasn't caused a mortgage-backed credit crisis for major banks...yet.

*So, weve established the main tools the FED uses to prop up the market and that they work.  What’s the problem, and why am I saying JPOW has forsaken us?*

**Because the Fed’s balance sheet has been contracting, and with that these programs are no longer offering nearly as favorable terms as they once were, but the market isn’t strong enough to handle those unfavorable terms.**

[here’s a graph from the FED showing their flatlining balance sheet](https://i.imgur.com/CoRcfBb.jpg)
The FED is spending less overall than it was earlier this year (remember, it takes a couple months for spending policy to catch up in the market).  *This was bound to happen, but the problem is the key programs I mentioned are all at obviously ineffective levels and haven’t been increased.* PROBABLY BECAUSE NOBODY COUNTED ON THE SECOND COVID SURGE DESTROYING PROGRESS IN EMPLOYMENT NUMBERS. 
**a) Repo operations haven’t been the zero-cost interest level since July**, moving from +0 basis points over the standard interest rate, to +5--and on longer term loan operations +10.  The market has not responded kindly to losing their free money, looking at the monthly SPY charts.
**b) While generous, the treasuries purchases have stalled out at 80 million**.  More importantly, the FED hasn't facilitated any key changes to which terms they purchase (long v short, etc). The market has responded to this stagnation with stagnation, looking at the monthly SPY charts.
**c) Bond purchases not set to increase**: The FED is still purchasing bonds, but have also stagnated the rates of that along with the other two facilities.  Kaplan, the Dallas Fed Chair who's always running his mouth, has [indicated a lack of support for increased corporate bond purchases. ](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/02/kaplan-says-hes-not-in-favor-of-fed-increasing-bond-purchases.html)

**What the contracting FED balance sheet, the stagnation of these increased liquidity programs, and the lackluster performance of SPY over the past three months combine to signal is that the market/SPY is NOT healthy enough on its own to continue its rise.  Sure there will be good days, I even have a 267 exiting Monday, but the absurd gravy train of June-August is no more. If you take the 5 day election bump out the picture, SPY has performed over 50% less than its aggregrate performance April-August.**

Why did I say don't buy the dip YET? Is help coming?  Yes.  Two potential ways:
**1) The stimulus**: if enhanced UI benefits are improved, the spending in the consumer goods and credit market would provide a huge boost that could offset the economic effects of an increasingly bleek jobs situation.

**2) The FOMC meeting on the 16th**: this is where the FED would make any decisive changes on the lending programs mentioned here.  My guy /u/curiousmaniac pointed out to me that these changes, if they even happened, likely wouldn't come to fruition in the new year (even if the policy is changed on the 16th).

**So yeah, you might wanna chill on SPY. I hear you saying “where was this BEFORE TODAY?! REVISIONIST HISTORY”**
-[here's my DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k9zcbo/why_the_market_is_becoming_the_economy_a_tale_of/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) from Tuesday saying not to go near SPY without a stimulus

To be fair, I'm wrong a fucking ton, as we all are lol. but gotta flx those few sweet moments you get it right.

**Positions:**
TLT is my new hedge against SPY because VIX and its derivatives are ass rn. I dont buy puts cuz im not sweet like that.  (here's my[ DD on VIX 101 if you're curious](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jfhdta/volatility_for_dummies_vxx_uvxy_vxx_and_spy/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf))
Other than that, monthly stimulus plays that favor consumer spending (on places that are at an advantage from hybrid online/retail models due to lockdown), TOL (housing numbers explode when stimmy passes), and TDOC because TDOC is dope. 

**WMT: 1/8 155c**
**TGT: 1/8 180c**
**TDOC 11/24 200c**
**TDOC 1/15 205c**
**AAPL: 1/8 126c**
**HPQ: 1/15 25c**
**TOL 1/15 46c**


**TLDR**: FED tools are drying up, SPY is too dangerous for now--market isn't strong enough on its own yet.  Count on monthlies that are a hybrid of pandemic retail/online winners in preparation for the stimulus, and pay attention the results of FOMC meeting on the 16th.  VXX sucks and I'm using TLT as a hedge.

**TLDR of the TLDR**: PLTR 1/15 500c, GME 12/24 35c (that’s a joke lol)

I'm going with eBay and buying 111 calls at $55.5 strike on 01/22/21

DD:

1. E-commerce has seen big gains this year! With Christmas, Q4 quarter will see more online shopping than ever before in history. 
2. Amazon, Spotify, Etsy stock prices have already realized big gains and their PE ratios are well above the average. Ebay's PE ratio is below the market average.
3. Ebay's Q3 net income was 8 times higher than Etsy and 4 times higher than Shopify.
4. Ebay has experienced >20% YoY growth the last two quarters. Their new CEO in April hasn't had a negative quarter yet.
5. Elliot Management said their stock was worth $53-65 PRE-COVID! The stock today sits under $49.
6. Since their Q3 earnings were lower than estimates, their Q4 forecasts are conservative. However, analysts are likely underestimating how much online shopping will be done this quarter with Covid and Christmas.
7. eBay has been the online store for PS5 and other cutting edge consumer devices. One estimate is the nearly $50 million has been sold since Q3 earnings call: [https://www.pcmag.com/news/scalpers-rake-in-43m-by-selling-ps5s-new-graphics-cards-on-ebay](https://www.pcmag.com/news/scalpers-rake-in-43m-by-selling-ps5s-new-graphics-cards-on-ebay)
8. eBay is selling pieces of the company unrelated to their marketplace and focusing on its core platform. Maybe it's growth isn't the same as Shopify or Etsy, but it makes more money, and it has more growth potential. It's way undervalued compared to its peers.

In short, if you think eBay will beat q4 estimates and continue their YoY growth with the new CEO, calls are at a discount. The main risk is an overall market correction._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Fuck "expert" stock analyst rating This is just a straight up rant about how fucking stupid analyst ratings are. They're all self fulfilling prophecies which is such bullshit. A stock will be going up and doing its own thing and then some piece of shit from a company will be like "yeah this shit is too high" and then it goes down because they said that. I've been fucked over so many times by this and it's such bullshit. Analysts are self fulfilling prophets that are given wayyy too much respect for the stuff that they do. They look at some metrics and spew their gay bear bullshit and then the stock goes down, not because there is anything wrong with the stock but because they said it will go down

I am too ashamed to open up to friends or parents and have been here since 2017 so I have always considered this as my outlet. Started late in life (schooling completed in 2011) and moved to the valley in 2017 for a $150k position where I discovered goddamn Robinhood. I've been chasing my losses ever since. 

My total stats:

2017-2019 Robinhood: -$90k USD ($115k CAD)

2019-now IBKR: -$74k CAD ($22,852 spent on commissions)

Current balance (everything I own): $80.82 CAD

Current loans I owe: $59k CAD

Not much else to say. From the bottom of my heart, I'm sorry to those I've offended on here. I honestly feel like a piece of shit for not having helped out my family at any point. My Korean mom would probably get a stroke if I told her my losses. I'm glad I tallied everything for one final look. Last post ever from me, not that I am anybody.

All- For those of you that follow Purple, there is likely a good opportunity to make a small gain on the latest drop. I would advise against options at this time but I wanted to make a small post because I recently invested in some leaps during the pullback.

 Purple is likely going to break up or down as it has been consolidating for several weeks and hasn't popped. Recent support levels have broken  and we've hit our 100 day moving average.

* I expect the next move is up but I am **purchasing shares** in the off event that we approach our next support level in the \~25 range.
* If we break towards 25.00, then I will sell my shares and go deep into April 20 and 22.50 calls As well as January 2022 17.50/20.00/22.50 LEAPS. I already own some positions but I will double down.

# TL:DR

* Consensus target is \~35.00. buy stock for the pop and if it drops, sell stock and double down on leaps. Leap positions mentioned above.
* **CAUTION - Some of these options are thinly traded so don't do any MARKET orders. Limit orders and make sure you understand the risks. This isn't advice, just my opinion.**

Purple has a relatively high Beta, it reacts more drastically as compared to the broader market. Historically Purple has hard large intraday swings, with last week being a perfect example. Purple peaked at 32.00+ and has since dropped nearly 20% on no news and no catalysts, aside from the faltering stimulus talks.

The narrative for purple has not changed. Purple grew 60% last quarter and they are expected to grow 60% in Q4 relative to 2019. They are in about 3% of available furniture stores in the USA and have recently expanded to about 300 canadian mattress stores.

I believe we are due for the next leg up. Purple has been consolidating for the last 2-3 months and it has tried to break out twice, with little success. I believe the breakout is likely being hampered by Market makers trying to collect premiums around the 30.00 strike. I expect that the following items may be catalysts for the next leg up. u/lurkingsince2006 Dm'd me about max pain theory and It appears that we have approached max pain theory for the last two months @ right around 30.00.

# Potential Catalysts After Options Expiration.

* Announcement of Factory opening soon. 
   * Purple started posting operator jobs for the georgia facility. This is the first postings I have seen for these, there have been management jobs posted for months but now they are looking for skilled workers to run equipment.
* Expansion into a major retailer like Ashley furniture.
* National roll-out in Q1 to Mattress Firm - currently only in about 30% of mattress firm stores.
* Unexpected business update - I doubt this will happen but it's possible.
   * Purple hasn't given guidance in two quarters and they have been radio silent lately.
* Stimulus approval would be super bullish- last stimulus created huge demand spikes for purple.

In fact, ive been recommending more people to move into SPAC plays instead because of the limited downside and room for price discovery especially for the retail investors like us. Investing in a good spac near nav is literally a no brainer and free tendies. That being said, since I have already done the research and a write up for Abcellera, might as well share it with everyone. Please keep in mind that im not recommending people buying into nor do I have a position in this stock. To be quite frankly, no way in hell should this company be trading at such level yet, at least not in another few years to come. But here you go:

We are talking about a company **backed by Bill Gates and has Peter Thiel as the board of director to bring the table experience in scaling technology companies (Daddy Thiel actually owns a stake of the company)**. Abcellera is a company **that helped Lily with the development of the antibody cocktail for COVID at a record-breaking speed** and is entitled to receive percentage of the proceeds that Lily receives from the sales. Currently US government has secured 300,000 does with the option to secure 70,000 more and Canada has secured 26,000 doses with more to come. **Abcellera has been cash flow positive every year since inception and has shown an annual revenue growth rate of 100% over the past 5 years and is here to print ya’ll motherfuckers some real serious tendies.**

About Abcellera

Abcellera is a technology company that searches, decodes, and analyzes natural immune systems to find antibodies that can be developed to prevent and treat disease through artificial intelligence, machine learning and advanced technology platform. **Traditional biotech industries usually take too long, cost too much and fails way too often. Drugs discovery usually takes 5 to 15 years with less than 5% success rate and cost billions of dollars to find approved molecules. Abcellera provides the teams and technologies that work broadly with the biotech industries to put the best science and best innovator in touch with the best technology to get faster drugs to patients.** Abcellera essentially **solves the two fundamental problems that hinder the discovery and the development of next generation antibody- based therapeutics. The first is the technology: because of the limitations of legacy discovery approaches, there are many well validated targets for which suitable antibodies cannot be found. The second is access: most companies are forced to cobble together fragmented solutions and lack the facilities and expertise needed to prosecute their antibody programs. Both problems contribute to the rising cost of drug development and delay brining needed therapies to patients.** With the leverage of Abcellera’s technology, Eli Lily was able to put out COVID-19 antibody cocktail to trials within a record-breaking speed of just 3 months. Abcellera was able screen through 5.5mil + immune cells to see which makes antibodies on Day 4, find 2K+ potential antibodies that could stick to the virus surface on Day 6, sequence through DNA of 500+ antibodies that could stick to virus spike protein on Day 9, select 190 most promising antibodies for potency testing on Day 17, and finally select 24 antibody front runners for Eli Lily to further develop them into antibody cocktail. Within the past 3 years, **Abcellera has already accrued more than 40 deals, engaged in 94 discovery programs, and under contracted with 26 partners.** **With validation from the partnerships with major biotech firms, it signifies the effectiveness and the reliability of the platform setting Abcellera up for a more lucrative terms and deals in the future.** Through the partnership agreements, Abcellera **will collect near-term payment for technology access, research and intellectual property right, and downstream payments in form of clinical and commercial milestones and royalties on net sales.

How big is antibody therapy?

Antibody therapy has already been one of the biggest discoveries and is not a thing of the future rather the thing of the present. In 2019\*\*, 7 out of 10 of the best-selling drugs were monoclonal antibodies.\*\* **The global therapeutic monoclonal antibody market has been valued at 150bil by the end of 2019 and 300bil by 2025** with many drugs already approved for treating cancers, autoimmune, metabolic and infectious diseases.

Competitive landscape

Although there are a few of companies developing antibody therapy drugs, they are not the direct competitors of Abcellera. **The purpose of Abcellera is to provide the technology for the biotech companies especially the small to medium firms the ability to compete on the same playing field as the big boys or act as a more cost-effective way of developing new drugs.** (Think of it as the biotech version of TSMC where it provides AMD the ability to compete or over taking Intel, or acts as a more cost-effective ways for chip designers like Apple and Qualcomm to push out chips.) **Over 90% of the antibody market is dominated by 8 companies and Abcellera is here to shake the ground.**

Notable highlights and future plans for the past months:

\- Named on the fierce biotech’s fierce 15 list company of 2020

\- Partnership with Invetx to develop new antibody therapies to improve the quality of life of animals and to bring next generation veterinary therapeutics to the market

\- Partnership with Kodiak science to develop eye disease antibodies

\- Partnership with IGM biosciences

\- Acquisition of Ttianni ( a company for developing humanized mice that is designed to maximize immune responses, increase antibody diversity, and preserve natural mutation of fully human antibodies in rodents)

\- Acquisition of OrthMab (a clinically validated platform that uses the most advanced computational and experimental protein engineering methods to create bispecific antibodies from any two antibody sequences.)_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ YOLO Revenge Trade? To short the end of a blockbuster event? (QS / QuantumScape) HYLN and QS constitute a tale of two YOLOs.

On the one hand, my brief foray into a HYLN YOLO within my overall HYLN swing trade worked out for me - big gains.  Earlier this week, I even went back into HYLN with a small $1K investment for the long haul.

On the other hand, my brief foray into QS YOLO within my overall QS swing trade yielded only small gains, as I sold before the merger.

Why couldn't QS spike to at least $30 pre-merger???  This was frustrating!

And now this *vaporware* play, fundamentally worse than even Fisker, pumps to an intraday ATH of $87.50?

So you know what?  I tried to short the shares, but that didn't work.

So you know what?

I just bought $10K of QuantumScape puts this morning:

P 15JAN21 65.00

I learned my lesson losing small money on my first options trade, the one with a smaller SPAC: Don't get against a stock going down immediately post-merger.

This time, though, there are no more catalysts up QuantumScape's sleeve and even Cramer knows this now: **It's PIPE dump time!**

[I saw this with HYLN, RIDE, and even that pretender FSR.]

Now, since I don't have my computer in handy, I can't buy more puts, but I do have time before the end of the day, also to have a better grasp of where the stock price will end up.

First DD Post so don't expect anything too fancy or long but I know at this point y'all probably stopped reading by now so nbd. I was hesistant to enter this since this is a dead company and options volume is illiquid as fuck. HOWEVER, I was trying to get my orders filled due to the horrendous bid-ask spread on PUTS but I then I noticed the volume pumping from single digits in the morning to over 1K instantly... someone, somewhere with deep pockets knows something for next Monday.

&#x200B;

**More Details:**

* If you check the SEC filing, they offered 77.6M shares at $28 during their IPO, and then later a secondary offering of 17.3M shares at $42. However, **272M** shares will be unlocked next Monday, 12/14, which means any employees, insiders, early institutional investors, or big bois who got in well below $28 can choose to take profits if they want. Current price is hovering between $45 and $46, so make your own decisions. There will be 2.86x shares released than the tradeable public float right now, but of course this is subject to Rule 144 so there are limits on the pure amount that can be dumped at once.
* Whoever pumped the option volume from single digits to over 1.2K got in around 0.35 - 0.55 for their premiums. Just a frame of reference if you wanted to get some confidence on overall pricing. Current premium for the same $40 PUT option right now is around 0.45, but bid-ask spread is high again.
* Safest play: If the stock bounces or rallies again today by the EOD, just follow whoever this whale option buyer is and try to pick up $40 PUTS for cheaper, maybe around 0.25 or 0.30. Note this is unlikely and you probably won't get filled in time, but most likely you will only lose 1 day of theta maximum and can selloff right away on Monday if insiders choose not to sell their shares.
* Riskier play: If you are more risk tolerant or like gambling, aka everyone on this sub, then just follow the WHALE and buy hundreds of the $40 PUT option. You will risk illiquidity to close and theta for 1 day though if the stock does not drop much.

&#x200B;

**Positions:** I'm poor as fuck and not employed yet so only **short 25 shares at $46.20**, and holding **4 Dec 18 $45 PUT options** (Sadly, this is decent chunk of my portfolio value). Also trying to get filled for 20 $40 PUTS, but probably won't happen in time before close to see if bid-ask spread lowers and premiums drop for a last minute bounce. Up around 100% but greeding until Monday.

EDIT 2: If anyone is more experienced and has insights on secondary offerings, their second prospectus filing date is 10/15. 10/15 + 91 days = 1/14/21. Will this be a second lockup period expiration? I believe that this only applies to later partners who were not in before/during the IPO.

As of writing, SPCE has a market cap of 7.8 billion dollars and 600 people have signed up, which comes out to $13,000,000/person while tickets are $250k/person. I may wear a helmet to sleep and ride the short bus to a puzzle factory every day but that math is too retarded even for me.

2. Blue origin will (eventually) fly you to space for $150k in a real rocket, not some weird looking airplane like SPCE that costs $100k more. If I’m going to go to space I’d rather get the complete experience and do it in Bezos’s giant overcompensating rocket cock (just google image it). If I want to be weightless then I can pay for a flight in a private vomit comet for $5k.

3. When the eviction mortarium ends and the shit really hits the fan, our streets are flooded with the newly homeless and every year brings a record forest fire season, even the most out of touch millionaires may think it is in poor taste to spend $250k and burn a shitload of fossil fuels for a 3-hour flight and maybe 5 minutes of weightlessness.

4. I grew up in New Mexico and Virgin’s spaceport is in an armpit in the middle of nowhere. The whole lead-up to the launch is going to be depressing, probably involving a \~3-hour long drive from the Albuquerque airport along a desolate stretch of interstate. Maybe they’ll set up a helicopter or commuter plane type service for VIPs but still they will have nothing else to do there. I think Virgin is the only occupant of the spaceport and the rest of the facility is deserted. No nice restaurants, no clubs, just dusty wasteland. Not cool.

5. Maybe a few people will still go through the hassle and expense of a SPCE flight (If they ever happen) but once word of mouth spreads and Forbes pays to send up a journalist to write up the whole experience then the excitement will be over. They will need thousands of customers a year to make this whole endeavor make sense and I just don’t see that ever happening.

6. Although I sincerely hope that this doesn’t happen, they already had one fatal crash in 2014. Not that I am in any way counting on it, but space flight is risky and rich-ass space tourists only want to **pretend** to do something dangerous. Even a whiff of another safety issue will tank the stock. 

7. SPCE has been messing around since 2004 and still has essentially no revenue but they lose more $$ every year.  Actually, this is kind of bullish?

8. Out of the aerospace people I have talked to (granted, only 3 of them; 2 BA and 1 Blue Origin) it seems like the cool kids work for either SpaceX or NASA. Most of them forget that Virgin Galactic is even a thing until you bring it up to them.

9. Even if the SPCE test goes well today I think it will be bad for them. They will see a funny looking airplane thing and then compare it to the gangster-ass shit that the other private space companies are doing and it won’t be a good look.

10. If you’re rich and boring and really need to make yourself appear interesting at dinner parties that badly then you can fly Blue Origin, buy a Lambo Urus or Huracan and have money left over. If you just want a memorable experience then you could get a $10K a day hooker for weeks and have the champagne and cocaine blowout of a lifetime.

&#x200B;_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ CCJ (Uranium), the last cheap green energy TLDR: CCJ $15c March 2021

Call me an autist, but while doing some value stock DD over the weekend, instead of typing in CCL, I typed in CCJ. Turns out there's something good to uncover.

CCJ (Cameco) is one of the larger uranium players currently listed in the US (that means RH-tradeable), and has quite a cheap option chain. Looking at the $15c March 2021, the IV is only \~50% which is much cheaper than NIO, FCEL or whatever the current meme stocks are. [It is also the second largest uranium producers accounting for 18% of the world's annual production](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameco).

I may be late one day already, but all the Uranium names had a fantastic day Friday, rising anywhere from 10% to 17%. Is this a start of a meme-able stock? Well, nothing has stopped [r/wsb](https://www.reddit.com/r/wsb/) from piling onto the bandwagon, be it [war](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eld4i6/all_in_the_war_machine/) or [disability](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f9sx9d/congrats_autists_the_cover_of_bloomberg/). Plus, the float for all the uranium names are all very small (hence enhanced W E A P O N I Z E D A U T I S M contravening rule #1 possibly).

(Uranium stocks performance over the last week)

So why Uranium? Number one is energy. Get your retarded heads out of your prolapsing anus. War demand for uranium is infinitesimal compared to energy. Nuclear energy is very cheap, according to the [EIA's 2019 Energy Outlook](https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/aeo/). Yes wind, natural gas etc are cheaper, but the Green New Deal should float all boats. There is a viable demand for uranium for energy use during the next decade, especially as the world tries to move towards electrification.

(Not the cheapest, but still cheap)

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/66xcwwvg9l461.png?width=496&format=png&auto=webp&s=9800575d2f4688995df3191f0fd45de7c09ca987

&#x200B;

 

Fine, so what about war? Well, that's the reason why uranium stocks popped on Friday. On Friday, House and Senate lawmakers revealed a compromise version of the annual National Defense Authorization Act. According to S&P Global, the bill effectively provides for the military to continue a policy under President-elect Joe Biden that classifies the domestic supplies of certain minerals such as uranium, graphite and lithium as vital to national security. You know what happens to companies which are deemed to have things critical to national security (BA, LMT, APT during March), they get bid up. Suddenly valuations jump, and all those underlying ores get a massive premium, because the government is backing up the price (kinda like the S&P and the fed put in a way).

Honestly, it's all about the meme capability. Dude, who doesn't want to own uranium? I heard you can make boom boom with it or something. Couple that with a 10% jump/day, historical lows for the actual uranium price, low IVs and low exploitable market caps and floats, your wife will drop her panties and run back to you once you announce you own a part of a uranium mine.

(Uranium futures prices back to 2008. 2008 high at $100, currently at $29.55)

Have you heard of the fallen Berry in the Fruit wars of the touch phones? 

NO?? Good I didn't expect you to know anything you retarded fuck!! and don't research it too or I'll call your wife's boyfriend to beat your ass!

Anyway... Black Berry has reinvented it self as an IT company in 2014 after John Chen became CEO. It now leads in the cybersecurity industry with contracts signed with 19 out of the 20 G20 countries. From the Airforce to Fortune 500 companies Blackberry handles their cybersecurity needs.

I can go on and on about how good they are in the cybersecurity space but WE DON'T CARE ABOUT THAT SHIT! What we care about is the EV(EV stands for electrical vehicle you retard) industry which **WE** Blasted into Saturn this year.

The Black Berry QNX software is in 175 million vehicles. In addition, BlackBerry just announced that it partnered with **Amazon** to create Black Berry IVY which is a software which will allow automakers to provide a consistent and secure way to read vehicle sensor data, normalize it, and create actionable insights  from that data that will allow automakers to create personalized driver and passenger experiences and improve operations of connected vehicles. **Blah Blah Blah,** why would I care? Because every car company and especially EV companies were looking for a service like this which Black Berry and Amazon **will literally pioneer.** In addition, the CEO mentioned in an interview the possibility of partnering up with our EV company **$TSLA.** Now imagine how news of this would affect $BB.

&#x200B;

Now your small brain might wonder with all of Black Berry's potential, why isn't it moving much in price???!!! 

In my opinion, It's because boomers are still butt hurt about the steep price drop of it after the fruit wars and that it never recovered. This company literally has a price to book value of 2.3. Which means it's very undervalued!! and it has **CASH** for days... so no worries about offerings.

**Now for the important part how could it rise to what it's actually worth??** 

We retards can adopt this $BB and raise it to be the next bloated(100$+) EV play in the industry. Why raise foreign fat Chinese babies(Nio, XPENG, etc..) when we can literally raise a malnourished North American $BB. 

$BB needs more exposure and we can start by making some High quality memes for it...

TL:DR ALL IN GME

GME earnings was largely a bull case for those following WSB's DD, but we've seen shares slide down. One of the main reasons is the potential dilution of shares from the shelf offering. People have explained that it's an offering of $100mil worth of shares, not actually 100mil shares but no one gave any numbers. Turns out I'm the only one out here with a TI-84 Plus CE. 

Based on the market cap before earnings call and a conservative estimate of 10mil shares offered at $10 share price.

16.94 x 69750000 / 79750000 = 14.82 (2d.p)

Based on share dilution alone, the stock would only dip to 14.82 on very conservative assumptions.

**TL;DR**

Royalty Pharma ($RPRX) IPO'd in June and lock-up expiration is DECEMBER 14, Monday.

- In addition to ~90 million shares, ~280 million (300%+ volume) additional shares are about to hit the market in the coming week.

- That is not including the potential of Class B -> Class A share converters, which means there can be an additional ~240 million shares on top of the aforementioned, to enter the market from Monday.

- RPRX IPO'd at $28 and has been rocking between ~$40-62 USD consistently since then. For insiders who bought the stock pre-IPO for $20 or less, they have made over 100% gains since June. With a metric ton potential of ~300m+ shares diluting the market, is this stock going to go UP or DOWN? Your turn.

I’ll keep it short, but Canoo is revealing another EV next week along with merging from $HCAC into $GOEV the following week. Yes, the ticker will literally be named $GOEV; how can WSB ignore that.

I’m thinking we’ll see another huge run up next week as news comes out and the merger is just around the corner. It did SUPER well this week and took a dump today due to Cramer stating people should take profits because it was rocketing.

Anyways, NIO. They just released more stock. I got it, that lowers price. They are doing that so they can BUILD MORE PRODUCTION, because they have SO MANY ORDERS and the PRC GOVERNMENT is enforcing the GREEN 2035 plan.

Guys... this is China... the Great Wall...  they created a nuclear program while they were a country of peasants....they rebuilt their entire fucking country over the past 20 years... they reforested entire stretches of Mongolia just out principle. The PRC is not a democracy... when they enact a plan the Central Committee does it. 

Also... just like the George Carlin skit, you’re not a real country until you have your own Beer, Sports Team, and Car. Guess what, Chinas got beer and sports... being able to buy their own nationally made car is going to be a HUGE matter of patriotism. 

That being said... if you missed the first run-up, now is the time to get in. Not saying buy now, just watch the dip and get in when you think it’s gonna start mooning

Thanks big papa mouse _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ 12.5k CRM call YOLO _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Short SNOW? _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Commodity Supercycle| Uranium Prop1: The general thesis is that we are headed into a commodity supercycle as Western world governments reinvest in infrastructure to tackle climate change and quickly employ people displaced by the pandemic and pre-pandemic knowledge economy.

Prop 2: From (1) Yellen will depreciate the USD to support the local US economy, thereby commodities will be repriced higher.

Prop 3: From (1) Countries like China, US, EU need small modular reactor (SMR) \[1\] \[2\] to provide stable electricity when there is no Sun or wind. Countries like India need SMR to replace oil imports, if they want to adhere to the Paris Climate Accord without risking stagflation. \[3\]

Prop 4:  Biden administration will invest heavily in SMR to supplement solar and wind infrastructure

Even Japan is restarting some reactors. Japan must restart many more nuclear reactors to meet the Paris Climate Accord and the 2050 goal.

In fact all countries need SMR to meet their 2050 climate goals because Wind and Solar is insufficient to give them a stable electricity output AND meet future demand on the grid by EVs.

From (2) and (3), Uranium prices will climb as nuclear energy will be considered and marketed as a renewable energy. ie Green nuclear.

Thank you for coming to my Ted Talk on uranium.

recommend: $CCJ LEAP calls_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ So what's the nextt Tesla-Style stock? From Feburary Tesla went up and analysts on both sides were wrong on if it will crash or when it would rise, it climbed up to over $1000 then dropped back down to $00 range on manipulated news, than in one week basically made all that up, exceeding $1000, and then did a stock split where it's climbed back to the 600's where it is currently..

While Tesla is still viable, for the average working man it's ***too expensive***, stocks over $150 will always be outside the working mans budget, but semi-far out the money options being $1000-$10,000 per ONE contract has also removed the budget mans ability to buy options. (unless they do spreads but that defeats the purpose.)

This is of course unless some idiot wants to pay .80 contract for the zero chance that Tesla gets to 950 in one week. The people who handled things correctly during Teslas months of run up have made hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars.

**So what's the NEXT Tesla, that will run up short-term AND long-term and** ***isn't a fad or obvious retail trap (like Nio, PLTR, etc.*****) that will grow to be another hundred thousand to million dollar maker within the next handful of months?**

Pos: 5k commons_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Disney STOCK NEWS | DoorDash & AirBnB Price Target | STOCK EARNNINGS & MARKET NEWS [12-11] **Disney lays out the plans for the future, the FDA advisory panel gives their OK. What’s my price target and should you buy DoorDash and AirBnB? Let’s talk about this and everything about the stock market**

Hey everyone and Good morning! So let’s start with the recap of yesterday as we only saw the [NASDAQ COMPOSITE](https://ibb.co/1RgJRtS) gaining some ground, up more than half a % while the [SP500](https://ibb.co/vQY7s6C) finished .13% down and the [Dow Industrial](https://ibb.co/BcgtnC2) fell just below 30k, losing .23% for the day. All 3 indexes traded way lower in the beginning of the day after the jobless claims came in, but recovered once the FDA Advisory panel meeting started. We also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/SwcQnHs) finish higher for the day after it opened at over 23 to start us off.

Almost 60% of the companies were advancing [yesterday](https://ibb.co/qdWy3jk), but the volume was way below average for most of them, with the Energy sector being the only significant gainer, up 3% for the day while most of the [sectors](https://ibb.co/5xskzgj) were flat or even lost ground for the day. On a factor [basis](https://ibb.co/Z28KH04), only large-cap value companies from the industrial sector suffered big yesterday, as small cap growth companies outperformed.

You can see in this [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/y0jvPBX), that big caps, with the exception of Apple and Tesla did struggle yesterday, while most of the companies with big gains were from the oil & gas industry, with Chevron gaining more than 3% for the day, while Exxon, Total and BP also had big gains.

The numbers that came in [yesterday](https://ibb.co/MPxZS56) on the economic front where mixed. As initial and continuing jobless claims came in [worse](https://ibb.co/NmgdXbJ) than expected, as more than 850K people filed for initial claims up more than 125K since the last week and what the analysts [expected](https://ibb.co/KrGcRk7), as this was the biggest spike in initial claims since march, while the continuing claims also rose for the first time since September. I am wondering, will [this](https://ibb.co/0X6FCH5) finally push the congress to act on a relief bill? I think the economy really needs it as a bridge to better times. Just look at the [EU](https://ibb.co/ncSgyWd), they have finally agreed on $2.2T budget and stimulus package to help the Eurozone get through the difficult times.

Better numbers came in from the consumer price [index](https://ibb.co/NjLW663), as the index rose by .2%, after it was unchanged in October, but this should be taken with a grain of salt, as most of consumer confidence increase comes from the high-income [consumers](https://ibb.co/DVJ5nK9), while people who have an income under $50K still struggling.

Also, the Federal [Budget](https://ibb.co/8BFdyZ7) came in better than expected as the deficit shrank more in November compared to October and compared to last year’s month.

[Today](https://ibb.co/pP78rTs) is a slow day in terms of economic data, but we do get a final read on the Producer price index and the consumer sentiment index.

We also finally got the [FDA](https://ibb.co/9gLsrh6) panel of outside experts meeting yesterday, which saw the panel vote 17 FOR, 4 against and one abstain. The only small concerns were on the topic of 16 and 17-year old’s as some experts argued that there is insufficient data on that subgroup, but I don’t think that is a case for concern, as the vaccine is likely going to take a while until young people will start to get the shot, as they are one of the least impacted groups. This is great news, as the FDA does usually follow up this committee advice, so we can see the FDA Emergency use authorization very very soon. Vaccine doses are already ready go within 24hours of the authorization so, things will start to move rather fast after that.

So, we got some earnings numbers yesterday from a lot of companies, let’s talk about them a little.

[COSTCO](https://ibb.co/C040BWf) posted a beat on the top and bottom line with e-commerce sales rising by more than 80%, while [comparable](https://ibb.co/YQQknbj) sales in stores were more than 17%. With both EPS and revenue beating the estimates, I think this might be the time to get into COSTCO, as they are one of the best retailers in the world, they always trade at a premium, the [stock](https://ibb.co/QnQNJGJ) is just about 5% from the all-time high and is far from overbought territory. I really like them as they have also rewarded shareholders constantly both with great growth and dividends.

[Broadcom](https://ibb.co/St74KMD) also posted a great beat on EPS and an 11% increase in revenues, fueled by a great beat in the semiconductor segment, while also posting a free cash flow of over $3B, way better than expected, as they also increased the quarterly dividend by 11% and have made a lot of [senior](https://ibb.co/hcMS6Vs) leadership changes yesterday, but the [stock](https://ibb.co/TB97nhZ) is down more than 2% in pre-market trading despite a lot of great numbers.

The company has most of its [revenues](https://ibb.co/bLbzgKL) coming from semiconductor solutions, this is very good as the [global](https://ibb.co/GfZGfnz) semiconductor sales have increased more than 5% in FY2020 and are expected to increase more than 8% for FY 2021, way better than the previous [outlook](https://ibb.co/MSrLh0p) of 6,2%.

The company also posted all time [highs](https://ibb.co/1vM8WP0) in net revenue, free cash flows, gross margin and adjusted EBITDA, while the compound annual [growth](https://ibb.co/zRW1jLZ) of the dividend since FY2016 is almost 50%. I think I might be investing even more in this company especially if they have a pullback.

Next let’s go to Lululemon who also [posted](https://ibb.co/qF1NnnN) a beat on EPS and Revenues, while comparable sales were up 19% with better gross and operating margins than expected. This was led by a huge [rise](https://ibb.co/zfKRJX5) in the international markets which will continue to expand as they gain more recognition overseas.

A smaller company that [reported](https://ibb.co/2WMrybz) yesterday was Dave & Buster’s as the losses were smaller than expected as comparable store sales declined by 66% as the restrictions in the restaurant industry keeps hammering away. The stock was trading +4% in after hours as investors may have though of an even worse result.

Moving on, [Adobe](https://ibb.co/Vjwwprm) also released earnings before the market opened yesterday, after a delayed earnings release. They posted a great beat on EPS and the revenues while also giving great guidance for next year, way above the consensus, with more than $15B in revenues and a EPS of over $11. The company also announced a new $15B share buyback [program](https://ibb.co/cKBbMpF) which will increase the value of the stock through the next 4 years while also have a strong [growth](https://ibb.co/G7BySxH) path, and despite all of this the stock [lost](https://ibb.co/Bnkk60T) more than 1,4% for the day.

The other earnings report that was released yesterday was from [Oracle](https://ibb.co/KsSGZNW), they also posted a great beat on the top and bottom line, but didn’t offer any guidance as that kind of disappointed investors and dipped about 1% in after hours. I don’t really have a great grasp of the company’s growth potential is right now.

We also got the Disney Investors meeting, in which the company share a lot of new great things. First of all, [Disney+](https://ibb.co/kJRc01G) has gone up another 18% since just 4 weeks ago, and is up to more than 86M subscribers, with the total number for the company’s streaming services surpassing 137M as they plan to expand Disney+ in Eastern Europe, South Korea, Hong Kong and other markets next year.

The company also [expects](https://ibb.co/4skfTC8) to have more than 230M subscribers by 2024, a very big increase from the prior estimate, while they are also planning on raising the monthly fee starting in March.

They plan to [release](https://ibb.co/F0G0C84) a lot of new content directly to Disney+, which is another big hit to the cinema world. With the Marvel and Star Wars series being big blockbusters for the movie industry.

They presented so much new [content](https://ibb.co/8jpZtWN) for the company, that it took them more than 2 hours to talk about all of this.

But they also [said](https://ibb.co/DWwJ1tg) that these decisions are temporary, and that they still prefer theatrical releases especially for blockbusters, so, there is still some hope for cinema’s, but maybe not just right now, it will take years to recover from this, and they will probably have to largely reduce the number of screens so that they may become profitable again.

So, over 100 new content releases per year is a lot for the [company](https://ibb.co/fFD4vhs), this was a very good investors meeting that pleased investors, as the company is [trading](https://ibb.co/Y86n6HD) \+7,5% in pre-market.

Disney is my second biggest position in my portfolio and I am really happy with what the company presented today. I think this stock may get to 200$ easily when the parks and entertainment business goes back online, as that accounted for 1/3 of the revenues before this year.

In other stock market [news](https://ibb.co/NL6sXcT), NIO will offer 60M shares, with an additional 9M shares option for underwriters. The stock fell sharply after the news, dropping more than 6% in After-hours [trading](https://ibb.co/85PycWh).

Also, Qualcomm suffered after the close yesterday, as the shares fell more than 5% after [news](https://ibb.co/5h4syVT) popped that Apple is moving to a develop their first cellular modem which will replace the Qualcomm modem in iPhone. The shares dropped as Qualcomm gets about 11% of its revenue from Apple.

So, one last thing that I want to talk about is the recent IPOs from DoorDash and AirBnb.

AirBNB also went public yesterday and [started](https://ibb.co/PCNjM3W) trading at $146, way above the $68 IPO price. This means the company has a [market cap](https://ibb.co/QNmGhqy) of over $100B, way higher than its rival Booking at $86B market cap and even [higher](https://ibb.co/cyp2hz1) than some of the biggest hotels in the world, Marriot & Hilton. The [stock](https://ibb.co/C9P3McG) even hit a new high of $165, I believe this happened as brokers started to get hands on the shares and orders started to fill in, but the stock did go back down to finish at $144, that means the stock gained more than 112% just in one day. The stock is down again more than 2% in pre-market guys.

I would avoid these stocks as much as I can as I believe they are well overhyped at the moment. I think we can see a pullback that may offer a better opportunity in AirBnb after the first earnings results. I would buy this company only if it drops to around 80$ as a price target, if not I maintain my sell opinion on the stock, though I personally, am not shorting any stock due to the risk of the high volatility associated with this companies as they have a very small share float.

While my opinion on [DoorDash](https://ibb.co/qkqSz1t) is that we might not see a pullback or correction as soon as AirBnb as demand will probably continue to be strong for at least a couple of quarters, before the growth slows down as well as very though future comps. We might see a drop in price then, as I think this stock is also well overvalued. I also maintain my sell opinion on this stock and just like with AirBNB, I am not going to touch this stock, I think a reasonable PT for DoorDash as a sell is about 100$. But I would try to stay away as much as possible, I’d rather go and find better growth opportunities in other companies, and not waste time and money on these 2 stocks.

Have a great day and see you next time!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Still counts as gainz right? _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ GME Survey 2: Diamond Hands, or Paper Hands? After receiving requests for an update, I decided to conduct a second survey to find out how people reacted to GME Q3 earnings. This survey is mainly for those who responded to the first survey before Q3 earnings. Only entries where the ID matches an ID from the first survey will be counted. Any significant increases in shares need to be confirmed via DM screenshot.

The preliminary results from the post-earnings responses to the first survey are extremely bullish. Almost everyone follow Buffett's advice to BTFD (or BTD, F):

**Response**|**Users**|**Pre-Earnings Shares**|**Post-Earnings Shares**|**% Change**
:--|--:|--:|--:|--:
Buy|20|13,074|23,596|80%
Hold|1|200|200|0%
Sell|1|67|0|-100%
**Total**|**22**|**13,341**|**23,796**|**78%**

&nbsp;

It's a small and probably biased sample: the only ones updating their responses are those who added more shares. That's why we need the second survey.

#WeWantCohen_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Airbnb Valuation - Growth is expensive in this market &#x200B;

* AirBnb has more than [4 million hosts](https://news.airbnb.com/thankyou/)  offering private rooms in their own homes to luxury experiences, from    one night to several weeks or months. AirBnb has a presence in more  than 220 countries and regions and has served over 825 million guest  arrivals and has cumulatively earned $110bn in revenue.
* AirBnb intends to [disrupt](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2018/02/airbnb-hotels-disruption/553556/) the one-size-fits-all approach that was the standard for travel and    leisure. The company believes that hosting is at the center of the AirBnb experience and this focus enables guests to access unique places and experiences that were previously inaccessible.
* In   2019, the  company generated Gross Booking Value of $38bn, 29%  growth  y/y,  and has generated $507mm in free cash flow since inception, signifying its clear potential to cash generation in the near future.  Gross Bookings Value were down 39% y/y in the first 9 months of 2020 due  to the Covid pandemic per the  [company S-1.](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1559720/000119312520294801/d81668ds1.htm)
* The company business model has shown resilience in the face of the   pandemic  with business beginning to pick up within two months of travel   shutting  down around the world per the company S-1. Domestic travel   has been especially strong and has rebounded at a rapid pace with   people choosing  to travel closer to home.
* The   stock is priced incredibly high,  and while we love the company and  what it’s doing, the valuation is  simply not enticing as an investor. The stock is trading near our absolute Bull Case scenario which we   outline in our valuation.

**Business Model:**

The  concept of AirBnb was born in  2007 when the two founders, Brian  and  Joe, noticed an international  conference was coming to town and  every  hotel was sold out. The  founders quickly created a website,   AirBedandBreakfast.com, and were  able to rent their apartment to the   conference attendees.

Airbnb is the latest company to make use of the [sharing economy,](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sharing-economy.asp) or the peer-to-peer economy. The business model is built on buyers  and   sellers sharing resources through collaborative consumption of  goods,   services, and of ownership. The Airbnb platform [provides tools](https://www.airbnb.com/host/homes) that make it easy to connect hosts who own houses and apartments with    guests who seek to rent them for short-term stays. Airbnb’s revenues comes from fees collected on guest rental stays with fees being  charged   on both the host and the guest side per the [company S-1](https://www.airbnb.com/host/homes). In 2016, Airbnb added another business line with [experiences](https://www.airbnb.com/s/experiences), but the business has been slow to gain any meaningful traction with only [$10 million in sales in 2017](http://aswathdamodaran.blogspot.com/).

This is a handy graphic summarizing the business model courtesy of [Aswath Damodaran](http://aswathdamodaran.blogspot.com/).

**Hosts:**

As of September 30, 2020, AirBnb had [4 million hosts](https://news.airbnb.com/thankyou/)  around the world, with 86% of hosts outside the United States, and 7.4    million available listings of homes and experiences, 5.6 million of   which were active listings per the [company S-1](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1559720/000119312520294801/d81668ds1.htm).   Per the company, “We consider a listing of a home or an experience  tobe an active listing if it is viewable on Airbnb and has been   previously booked at least once on Airbnb.”

Hosts generally fall into two categories – individual and [professional.](https://www.airbnb.com/d/host_pro) Individual hosts activate their listings directly on the Airbnb    platform through the website or app. Professional hosts in contrast run    their own property management or hospitality business and use programs    to list their properties on the Airbnb platform. As of December 31,  2019, 90% of hosts were individual hosts and 72% of nights booked were    with individual hosts per the [company S-1](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1559720/000119312520294801/d81668ds1.htm). Individual hosts are the core component and key supply for Airbnb.

Airbnb provides a number of services to enable their 4 million hosts. Anyone [can become a successful host](https://www.airbnb.com/host/homes?af=43720035&c=.pi0.pk37076538223_185707635826_c_141022032497&gclid=CjwKCAiAq8f-BRBtEiwAGr3DgW9my6otYP6hT1Yr5gQAFtISRM1zMA7k0KbUXYnB7wIFE1cdiLkoHhoCoK8QAvD_BwE) on the Airbnb platform and Airbnb is able to provide a number of services per the [S-1](https://www.airbnb.com/host/homes?af=43720035&c=.pi0.pk37076538223_185707635826_c_141022032497&gclid=CjwKCAiAq8f-BRBtEiwAGr3DgW9my6otYP6hT1Yr5gQAFtISRM1zMA7k0KbUXYnB7wIFE1cdiLkoHhoCoK8QAvD_BwE) including:

* Global demand: Anyone with an internet connection can book an Airbnb experience from anywhere in the world
* Merchandising: Airbnb helps hosts create and activate their listings on the  platform. By taking hosts step-by-step through the process, Airbnb is  able to  make  posting effective and easy.
* Pricing:  Hosts can set their own  prices, but Airbnb does provide smart pricing  tools that suggest prices  based on changes in demand for other similar listings based on factors like the season and expected demand.
* Scheduling:   Hosts can  easily manage their calendars and accept and manage their  listings and  reservations on the platform through the website or app.
* Payments:  Airbnb facilitates all payments by collecting payments from guests and    processing the payments to hosts. In 2019, Airbnb processed  approximately $70bn of guest and host transactions.

Airbnb also provides services like community support, host protections, posted reviews and feedback, and a superhost program.

**Key metrics and Covid resilience:**

According to the company [S-1 filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1559720/000119312520294801/d81668ds1.htm), the majority of guests who have ever made a booking on Airbnb were  between the ages of 18-34. In 2019, 54 million active bookers worldwide  booked 327 million nights and experiences on the platform.

https://preview.redd.it/qd5s6uwbak461.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=8f31f59757384127b60bcee981d39fe6f51b4ce2

Nights and experiences booked are a key measure of the true scale of  the Airbnb platform. Per the company S-1, “Nights and Experiences Booked  on our platform in a period represents the sum of the total number of  nights booked for stays and  the total number of seats booked for  experiences, net of cancellations and alterations that occurred in that  period.”

In   2019, Airbnb had 326.9 mm Nights and Experiences booked, a 31% increase from the 250.3 mm in 2018, which grew 35% from 2017. Typically,    the first, second, and third quarters of the year each have higher Nights and Experiences Booked compared to the fourth quarter, as guests  travel during the peak travel season, which is in the third quarter  for   North America and EMEA according to the company S-1.

Covid has obviously [had an effect](https://www.ahla.com/covid-19s-impact-hotel-industry) on the hotel industry, and Airbnb is not immune with 2020 being a down    year and Q2 being particularly severe across several key metrics. However, the business model has shown resilience and management attributes this to the renewed ability and willingness of guests to travel. I know personally I’m looking at Airbnb’s in warmer climates as I’m itching to get out of the cold and soon to be lock downed  northeast US.

https://preview.redd.it/cjgmuu5gak461.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=7dc335ba9eb14e5cf2a93d394d12362943848213

For the nine months ended Sept 30,   2020, the company had 146.9 mm  Nights and Experiences Booked, a   decrease of 41% compared to the prior year period according to the [company S-1](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1559720/000119312520294801/d81668ds1.htm).    However, the decline was most severe in the second quarter and   business  has rebounded with Q3 being down only 28% y/y. The company   credits this  improvements primarily to stronger results in North   America and Europe  and in particular to resilience in domestic and   short-distance travel.

Gross   Bookings value is defined in the S-1 as “the dollar  value of  bookings  on our platform in a period and is inclusive of host  earnings,  service  fees, cleaning fees, and taxes, net of cancellations  and  alterations  that occurred during that period.” Growth in Gross Bookings Value  reflects the company’s ability to attract and retain hosts and guests   and  reflects growth in Nights and Experiences booked. In 2019, Gross  Bookings Value grew 29%  y/y and 2018 grew 40% y/y.

https://preview.redd.it/zgld3exgak461.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=a8898a508d1ffdec0acc59d243e23ea945538c74

In 2020, there is a similar drop in  Gross Bookings due to the Covid pandemic.  For the first nine months  ended Sept 30 2020 Gross Bookings was $18bn, a 39%  decrease from the  prior year period  according to the S-1. The decline  was once again  most severe in Q2 and  Q3 rebounded, being down only 17%  y/y.

In   2019, Gross Bookings and revenue by region were about equal between  Europe, Middle East, and Africa and  for  North America. However, as a  result of the pandemic, Gross Bookings and revenue have reflected a  shift toward North America where the recovery has been strongest.   “For  the first nine months of 2020, Gross Bookings Value was $9.7 billion,  or 54% of the total, in North America compared to $5.6 billion, or 31%,  in Europe, Middle East, and Africa, $1.6 billion, or 9%, in Asia  Pacific, and $1.1 billion, or 6%, in Latin   America” – company S-1

https://preview.redd.it/l8vwl6klak461.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=c47266ada3851c20e505b022c3054c850715bea5

Historically, Airbnb has had a strong weight toward cross-border travel,  with 49% of nights in 2019 compared to management’s estimate of 20% of total overnight paid trips for the travel industry as a whole according  the company S-1. However, the pandemic has marked a shift to  domestic travel in Airbnb’s traditional travel corridor mix. In   September 2020, 77% of experiences booked were domestic compared to 52%  in January. In  fact, domestic bookings have grown at a rapid clip with   54% growth in  June 2020 and 35% growth in September 2020. 

https://preview.redd.it/zap4dhgnak461.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=147ce7e7e1b224cbcbaf8e2eeb54a78c1dd7e1b9

Clearly, Airbnb is well-positioned because of its wide offering to cater   shifting consumer travel habits and this has enabled the company to be  more resilient in a downturn than travel competitors, in some metrics even being able to achieve grow. If we look at hotel and travel booking competitors, we see that Airbnb has weathered the pandemic much  better   than most peers when looking at 9 months ended Sept 30 2020 revenue. Airbnb revenue is down -31.9% so far in 2020 compared to the  median hotel revenue being down -48.2% and travel bookings being down  -53.3%.  Airbnb has also bounced back faster than every competitor minus  [CHH](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1046311/000104631120000041/chh-10q09302020.htm) in Q3 with revenues down -18.4% compared to the 50.9% median for hotels and -52.7% for travel bookings companies. 

https://preview.redd.it/q0lc324qak461.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=7ba72173c69f93b6a926d36b67d15fdc46e8beb2

**TAM and growth strategy:**

Management highlights massive market opportunities in its [S-1 filing,](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1559720/000119312520294801/d81668ds1.htm)  “We have a substantial market opportunity in the growing travel market    and experience economy. We estimate our serviceable addressable market    (“SAM”) today to be $1.5 trillion, including $1.2 trillion for   short-term stays and $239 billion for experiences. We estimate our total addressable market (“TAM”) to be $3.4 trillion, including $1.8   trillion  for short-term stays, $210 billion for long-term stays, and   $1.4 trillion for experiences.*”*

In   general, these assumptions are based on the belief that new travel   behaviors will expand the market opportunity over time as well as the need to justify a large market cap. Management uses their own internal    estimates to come up with the $1.2trn for short-term stays and [Euromonitor](https://www.euromonitor.com/usa)estimates of tourist spend on attractions and experiences to estimate  the $239mm for Experiences. To get the TAM short-term stays estimate, management assumes an increase in trips per capita based on The World    Travel and Tourism Council [estimated 3.5% CAGR](https://wttc.org/Research/Economic-Impact).   For long-term stays, the company uses 10% of the $1.6trn global residential rental market. And for experiences, they add $1.1trn of   non-tourist recreational spend, again as estimated by [Euromonitor](https://www.euromonitor.com/usa).

https://preview.redd.it/jrckxy31bk461.png?width=548&format=png&auto=webp&s=9c9e4ea99993a2e8f07644dbfed790ac2b7d722b

 In its early stages when it was a [startup pitching to VCs back in 2009.](https://millennialmkts.com/Users/danie/AppData/Local/Temp/startup%20pitching%20to%20VCs%20back%20in%202009)  Airbnb estimated the TAM to be 2 billion+ trips a year and its SAM to be 560mn trips a year. 

https://preview.redd.it/o3cwgw32bk461.png?width=521&format=png&auto=webp&s=6814c943d70ac8e5951c247875995e27c3e39d2f

 Another way to look at Airbnb’s TAM is to look at the hotel business globally. According to NYU professor [Aswath Damodaran’s Airbnb analysis](http://aswathdamodaran.blogspot.com/).    The industry generated over $600bn in revenues in 2019, but its  growth   has stalled and the industry remains concentrated among the top  5  hotel  chains. The US is the leading geographical market, but Asia  has  been gaining ground. 

https://preview.redd.it/ave4p504bk461.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=8428d25c1841c71eb27dafe2469238ea6f608238

The truth is Airbnb’s TAM, and we   agree with Damodaran’s analysis  here, is probably somewhere in between  these two numbers. Ignoring  Airbnb’s experiences portion of the TAMcalculation because that  business line is nascent at best, we get a upper estimate of $2trn and a  lower estimate of $600bn for Airbnb’s   TAM.

**Peers:** 

We   identify comparable peers to get a sense of Airbnb’s valuation and   how  in-line it is with the industry, while also keeping in mind Airbnb   is  growing faster and attempting to disrupt the hotel and travel  booking   industries. Current Hotel comparable peers are trading at a median of 4.1x 2021 sales and 2.0x 2022 sales according to [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/professional/solution/bloomberg-terminal/)  Analyst Consensus estimates, while Airbnb’s IPO price implies – 18.45x  and 15.33x Sales based on our own estimates of 2021 and 2022 sales,    respecivetly. The EBITDA comparison is tough to make with Airbnb because    we estimate they will be EBITDA negative in 2021, and the EBITDA in    2022 and 2023 will be $130mm and $370mm leading to high multipliers. We    can see that the median hotel company is trading at 22.3x 2021   estimated  EBITDA and 13.9x 2022 estimated EBITDA according to Bloomberg    consensus.

However, perhaps a   more apt comparison is looking at online travel  booking peers such as   Expedia (EXPE) and Booking.com (BKNG). The EV /  Sales and EV / EBITDA are slightly higher for this comparable group vs  the pure hotels peers,   primarily due to Booking.com. The median among  this group trade at   4.5x 2021 sales and 3.4x 2022 sales according to  Bloomberg consensus.

https://preview.redd.it/40h2lhl9bk461.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f32a8d313aa93cee47b38d78f6ed105578f86ef

 

Is the Airbnb premium justified? One   can argue a more resilient  business model, the promise of fast growth, and large market opportunities created by disruption and innovation may make the premium  seem reasonable when we try to compare the  company to  peer groups. There  truly is only one Airbnb and these peer  groups aren’t entirely  indicative of the future company profile of  Airbnb.

**Valuation:**

Setting the stage for the valuation, we take a look at Airbnb’s [Venture Capital pricing in](https://craft.co/airbnb/funding-rounds) the rounds leading up to the IPO. We can see that the company has    raised $5.8bn in VC funding and it’s latest Series F round in 2016. In  April 2020 the company was valued [at $18bn](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-airbnb-debt/airbnbs-new-1-billion-investment-comes-at-lower-valuation-sources-idUSKBN21P3IM).

https://preview.redd.it/zgc3eyeabk461.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=298b0e974f95c2b74ec900ff1d9e6856b0c6fdfb

The IPO has clearly priced in a lot   of generous assumptions as well  as simple speculation with a hot   market. Initially, Airbnb planned to  sell shares for a range of [$44-$50 per share](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1559720/000119312520306257/d81668ds1a.htm) in a filing made December 1. Then on December 7, they announced plans to sell shares for a range of [$56 – $60.](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1559720/000119312520311265/d81668ds1a.htm) The company then priced their IPO at [$68 a share](https://www.wsj.com/articles/airbnb-expected-to-price-ipo-above-56-to-60-a-share-range-11607527468) on Wednesday, December 9. Shares opened trading at around $150 and ended the day at $144.71.

Here’s some [institutional investor background](https://themarketear.com/posts/coBkK-wxO2)   on how this IPO is being looked at, "Sanford  Bernstein ran a  Procensus investor survey to compile major talking  points. \~100   investors participated. Consensus  suggests Airbnb delivers a +16%  revenue CAGR in the next  decade with  steady state margins at \~25%.  Bulls will argue the IPO price  range (now indicating near \~$60) is reasonable”

\+16%  Revenue CAGR  seems somewhat reasonable to us, so the biggest assumption in question  really is the \~25% margins in our view. With that being said, and trying  to remain reasonable from an assumptions stand   point, here are our  main assumptions:

* In  2020 Airbnb Bookings will be down \~34%, but Airbnb will have a  bounce   back year in 2021, with high Bookings growth in 2022-2025, and   Bookings  growth slowing in 2026-2030. Our Base case in Bookings growth   is shown  below.

https://preview.redd.it/9pqh0wigbk461.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=41f519e04eed800de49de37bd391f170f8207f81

* Revenues   as a % of Bookings will continue to increase  in the future as the new   host model for professional hosts and  Experiences business gain steam   and a larger % of Airbnb Bookings.  Revenue as a % of Bookings was [12.6% in 2019](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1559720/000119312520294801/d81668ds1.htm) and we estimate it will be around 14.6% in 2025 for example.
* Operating    costs will continue to decrease as a % of revenue as Airbnb continues    to grow in scale. This continuing growth in scale culminates in a  high   single digit operating margin by 2025 and a 27.1% operating  margin by   2030. This is lower than Booking’s (BKNG) operating margin  of [35.5% in 2019](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1075531/000107553120000011/bkng1231201910k.htm), but higher than hotel operators such as [Marriott’s](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1524358/000152435820000011/a2019q410-kdocument.htm) (VAC) or 17.4% [Hyatt](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1468174/000146817420000015/0001468174-20-000015-index.htm) (H), 9.1% respectively in 2019.

https://preview.redd.it/u0vwzf4ibk461.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=5ab6c603129841215f6cde4c026ece0fff823325

Taking a look into future revenue growth scenarios with revenues  increasing as a % of Bookings and Bookings growth, we get a range of potential 2025 revenues. We think anywhere from $11bn to $13.7bn in revenue is the likeliest scenario for Airbnb in 2025. 

https://preview.redd.it/rqq5brtjbk461.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=131a5ef3c87d7a9556fdb5c8c2822e4626e7e8f5

Using a discounted cash flow model with a [Weighted Average Cost of Capital](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/wacc.asp) of 8% and a [perpetual growth rate](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/perpetuity.asp) of 3%, we get a Base Case price of $77.40.

What’s interesting in our valuation is that the vast majority of value in Airbnb is from the [Net Present Value](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/npv.asp) of the [terminal value](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/terminalvalue.asp). Because Terminal Value is based on the company’s value in perpetuity    beyond our 10-year cash flow forecast, assumptions have an incredibly large effect on the current valuation. Any sort of valuation can be justified based on any set of input growth assumptions. We try to stay  reasonable while acknowledging the upside that Airbnb does really exhibit. We show a range of cases below:

https://preview.redd.it/m3p1i80mbk461.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=cf3f5dd4ab45530a22ac077e8c5bc23416b59726

 **Upside and Downside Risks:**

Upside risks include higher than anticipated Bookings leading to  higher   revenue estimates. It is certainly possible we (and the market)  are  underestimated top line growth potential as Airbnb continues to  expand   domestically and abroad.

Another upside risk is profitability. Airbnb in theory should be able  to scale effectively given its business model and that the company  itself does not own or hold the properties. They provide a platform and  services, not the physical product, so as they become larger more  efficiencies   should be achieved and redundancies should be eliminated.

The main downside risks are two: valuation and regulatory issues. We  love   this company, but the valuation is simply incredibly rich and  already  at our Bull Case. A good company does not equal a good  investment if  the price is not good. However, we are not calling for  shorting this   because the market is red hot and can continue to be for  months or even   years. We are simply stating that odds are [not in your favor](https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2019/02/19/howard-marks-cfa-getting-the-odds-on-your-side/) here at this price level.

Another meaningful risk is regulatory scrutiny. Airbnb [lists what regulations apply](https://www.airbnb.com/help/article/961/what-regulations-apply-to-my-city) may to a host’s city and there has been pushback in certain [cities](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/05/nyregion/airbnb-jersey-city-election-results.html) and [communities](https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/new-effort-underway-to-regulate-short-term-home-rentals-in-st-louis/article_370e0012-0338-574d-8f17-38afd097f93c.html) against short-term rentals through platforms like Airbnb. Here is a list of certain [short-term rental laws](https://www.2ndaddress.com/research/short-term-rental-laws/) across the US.

**TLDR;** Great company, not so great valuation. If you like Airbnb, you'll love  BKNG. It's priced for perfection, but market is hot and it can stay  hot  for months or years so time will tell if/when it'll come down._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $NIO is fuk _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Dow Jones selloff has begun _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Ready for Open _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ UK Supreme Court enables $18.5 billion class action against Mastercard / Leap Calls or Puts? _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ This is the Way _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ SUMO is a sleeper stock and remains grossly undervalued Sumo Logic (SUMO) is a cloud-based data analytics company competing against Splunk and Datadog. 


* SUMO's IPO went unnoticed on September 17, which was the day after Snowflake's IPO. 

* They beat Q3 2020 earnings on Dec 7th by 28% YOY and have very good upside potential. 

* It's very undervalued when compared to competitors.

* Current **market cap of only $2.75B**, a TTM revenue of $192M, and a current share price of about $26-27. 

* Current analyst price targets are a median of $29.50 and a high of $34. I think it could EASILY hit $100 within 12 months time (reason below).



**Is this company better than Datadog? No, but it's hugely undervalued in comparison:**



DDOG Market Cap: $30.92B



DDOG Revenue TTM: $539.58M 



**DDOG P/S Ratio = $30.92B/$539.58M = ~57.3**



SUMO Market Cap: $2.75B



SUMO Revenue TTM: $192M




**SUMO P/S Ratio = $2.75B/$192M = ~14.3**

(Source: Yahoo Finance on Dec 11, 2020)




DDOG's P/S ratio is **FOUR TIMES** higher than SUMO's! With 102M shares outstanding, SUMO can hit $100 with a modest market cap of $10B. Once this stock gets proper attention, I believe it will steadily climb to its true valuation. This industry isn't going away and is growing rapidly as we speak.

Edit: formatting improvements_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ The Hound of Hounslow (How an Autist Broke the Market) On May 6, 2010, Jim Cramer’s brain broke. “That is not a real price,” he yelled to his monitor. “OK? That is not a real price.” Proctor & Gamble had just fallen 25% in a manner of minutes, then 29%, then 31%. Cramer had never seen such a shiny knife, such a beautiful buy, and he searched frantically for the right camera to beg his followers to add PG to their portfolio. 

There weren’t enough buttons on Cramer’s soundboard to fully capture how he felt about the quickest drop in Dow Jones history. In what would later be dubbed “The Crash of 2:45” or simply “The Flash Crash,” over a trillion dollars was wiped from the stock market in a manner of 15 minutes. The odd thing was, despite dropping more than 9% at one point, the market would rapidly recover a bit after 3 PM and would close only 3% lower for the day.

In the ensuing days and weeks, journalists and financial commentators and United States Congressmen would try and determine where this volatility had come from. Something *weird* had just happened.

\#

In the investigations that followed, regulators would consider a couple of theories. Was this a “fat-finger trade” where a trader inadvertently placed a large sell order, triggering a domino effect of sorts where algos would in turn sell? Was this a well-coordinated cyberattack, aimed to cripple American institutions? Was it simply a dip exacerbated by high-frequency traders? Had Janet Yellen forgotten to change the printer toner?

Nobody knew. But five months after the flash crash, the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) released a joint report that on May 6, 2010 the market was “so fragmented and fragile that a single large trade could send stocks into a sudden spiral.” They stated that a group called Waddell & Reed Financial Inc. had inadvertently played a role in the crash by initiating a sale of 75,000 E-Mini S&P contracts ($4.1 billion total) as a hedge to an existing position. This, the report said, coupled with the high-frequency traders trying to sell the long futures contracts they had just picked up from Waddell & Reed, led to a game of “hot potato” where the contracts were resold to other HFTs.

The report though was leaving out a crucial player.

\#

In 2005, Navinder Sarao was living the dream. At 27 years old, he still lived with his parents in Hounslow, a working-class suburb outside of London, demanding tendies to be delivered to his bedroom by his sweet emigrant mother. To the people who knew him, Navinder, or Nav, was known to be quick-witted and quick to anger. He was dominant at Halo and FIFA, and he had a proclivity to focus on one task for hours and hours on end until he mastered it. He was almost obsessive in his interests.

Despite still living with his parents, young Nav had aspirations. In 2006, he responded to an ad in the Evening Standard that read, “Wanted: futures traders. Must work well under pressure.” That’s it. That was the ad. And Nav, with no experience and a honey mustard-stained tie, went to the FutexLive headquarters—a drab office situated above a supermarket 45 minutes outside London—and successfully hid his Asperger’s and got the job. He was now a professional trader.

Nav picked things up quickly. Realizing that he was surrounded by day-trading retards, he moved his desk to the corner of the shabby trading floor and bought a pair of noise-canceling headphones. He’d found success trading E-mini S&P Futures, which is the primary futures trading vehicle for the S&P 500. And with his noise-canceling headphones, Nav would follow the orders that would enter and leave the markets. His coworkers would marvel at the autist in the corner and the returns he was regularly pulling in.

Then 2008 happened. By the time the financial crisis was in full swing, Nav was almost thirty and had decided to leave Futex. He had accumulated $2 million from his trades the last couple of years, and he figured the most prudent move as a budding millionaire was to set up his command center in his bedroom. He still lived with his parents.

\#

Nav realized something early on in the mortgage crisis that not everyone else did. He realized that governments would be forced to step in and save these retarded institutions, and he knew the banks wouldn’t be allowed to fall. And he bet $2 million—his whole net worth at the time—that he would be right. He made this bet on a Friday, and the following Monday, George Bush announced the TARP plan.

Prices proceeded to recover 19% over the next couple of weeks, and Nav rode the wave and turned his $2 million into $15 million. Did he rest on his laurels? Fuck no, this kid’s retarded! Nav didn’t want a wife and a home with a couple of kids running around. He wanted GLORY.

\#

Around 2010, the markets were seeing an influx in high-frequency trading, and Nav took personal insult to these robots. People were getting scalped by these algos, and those scalps belonged to Nav. Those profits were rightfully his.

In order to beat the robots, Nav decided to build his own robot. And unsurprisingly, fueled by Code Red and autism, Nav’s algo worked magnificently. Pretty soon, he was regularly pulling in half a million a day. All the while living in a cramped bedroom of his parents’ home that cost $300,000.

\#

May 6, 2010, started out as a regular day for Nav. The markets were sliding a bit, and Jim Cramer was flailing about his studio as though he were fighting a cloud of bats, but this was roughly on par for the time. Nav’s algo was pumping E-mini sell orders into the market—$200 million worth of orders to be exact—which ultimately resulted in a loss of liquidity (don’t ask me how this worked, I’m still confused why my PLTR 12/11 40C aren’t printing). At around 1:40 EST, or 6:40 in Hounslow, his mother called from the bottom of the steps to inform Nav that din-din was ready and would he please come down. 

So Nav logged off.

And exactly one minute after that, the market began to fall at a rate that had never seen before. Nav had no idea though; he was in an argument with his father about why he needed to chew with his mouth open in order to let the scalding tendy fumes out. A trillion dollars had been wiped from American markets, and the instigator of it all was too retarded to know what he’d done. 

The tendies were good though.

\#

The trillion-dollar loss turned out to be not that big of a deal. The DOW snapped back from the 9% freefall like a rubber band, like any stock that Andrew Left has deemed to be a casino. But the NYSE and NASDAQ officials proceeded to meet over the next couple of months to try and determine what caused the nosedive and rapid recovery. In the reports that they would write, regulators made no reference to manipulation and no reference to Nav. In fact, he wasn’t even aware there was an investigation going on. He wasn’t aware he did anything wrong.

But regulators eventually began to notice that Nav was canceling a lot of orders. The CFTC sent him an email and asked if he could explain what he’d been up to. What was the reason for his canceling an obscene number of orders? That’s what big banks did. And that’d usually be fine and all, but Nav was a singular trader and that made it suspicious. 

Nav wrote back to the CFTC explaining in careful terms that he had nothing to apologize for and that the CFTC could kiss his ass. He actually sent that. He told the CFTC to kiss his ass. Which, in hindsight, might’ve been a bad idea but the regulators were still too stupid and boomery to charge him with anything at the time. Nav would’ve gotten away with it too if it weren’t for a blabbermouth desk trader in Chicago who months later reported a different block of Nav’s trades to the CFTC, rekindling the case against Nav.

The investigation and case were dragged out over months and years, and I know 99% of you were too impatient to get this far, so I’ll give the cliff notes for the rest. Basically, Nav would eventually be charged with “spoofing,” which is the purchase of a large block of orders with the intent to cancel them. Spoofing artificially drives prices higher or lower. So the FBI and other concerned parties showed up on the doorstep of Nav’s Hounslow townhome in 2015, and he was extradited to the U.S. The judge learned he was worth $50 million, so he set bail to $7.5 million. Curiously enough though, Nav couldn’t access the $50 million or pay bail, and it was later determined that he’d somehow lost the fortune, seemingly to various shady investment advisors who promised to keep his money safe. (I personally like to think he’s stashed his earnings into a Caribbean account and that he’ll return to his private island once things blow over)

Over the next couple of months, Nav worked with investigators and taught them how market abuse happens. He was diagnosed with Asperger’s by a prison doctor, and the judge, sensing the moral dilemma of incarcerating an autist, and sensing Nav had received punishment enough from being scammed out of his $50 million, recommended a year of house arrest. 

So Nav is currently serving his year of house arrest in the same bedroom where he amassed $50 million. But now he’s penniless at 41. 

TLDR: Some autist beats the system, but the casino is angry and creates new rules to retroactively punish him for his winnings._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ 12/11 SPY and TSLA POSSIBILITIES or STOP LOSING YOU'RE MONEY or I'M BACK FRIENDS and I MISSED YOU! \*\*NOTE: These trades are recommended assuming you have PDT permissions.

🌈 m's banned me for a DD that was short but actually made money for those who followed it. 

Have a read you all.

Seeing that a significant interest has developed around the fabled GME short squeeze, I have written this post and I hope this writing provides an overview of the situation.

# The case for a squeeze:

The entire argument for a short squeeze hinges on the possibility that either the management agrees with Ryan Cohen's [plan](https://archive.is/qUm5s) and addresses it or he decides to pursue a hostile takeover.

**In this spirit, we urge you to quickly provide stockholders with a credible and publicly-available roadmap for cost containment, prioritizing profitable retail locations and geographic markets, and building the e-commerce ecosystem gamers deserve.** (from the letter)

This is Ryan Cohen's plan in its most raw form. Or to put it more simply, he wants GameStop to become the ultimate destination for gamers by leveraging its 55 million PowerUp members, its brand power; reducing lossmaking operations in Europe and Australia and to make investments in a Chewy like website for gaming.

Has management been doing anything? Yes. A lot.

[It's hiring talents for building a successful online gaming store.](https://careers.gamestop.com/en-US/search?keywords=&location=Grapevine,Texas,USA&placeid=ChIJX6Af7HUqTIYRDS8xoHABMCw&facetcitystate=grapevine,tx) [Entered into a multi-year revenue-sharing agreement with Microsoft.](https://news.microsoft.com/2020/10/08/gamestop-announces-multiyear-strategic-partnership-with-microsoft/)

It has also received a saving grace by the newest console cycle in which some people thought(like me) diskless gaming is going to be the leader. But the reality turned out to be [quite the opposite.](https://www.pcmag.com/news/report-only-25-percent-of-ps5-pre-order-stock-is-cheaper-digital-edition)

Add to that, the Nintendo Switch sold like wildfire in the US and is going strong, you have a winning combination for GameStop which would likely result in good quarters for the coming quarters.

Management has also started a rebranding effort with some changes being made to its logo, items that are kept in-store and online etc.

It seems like management is likely to address Cohen's concern and the lifeline it has received or will be receiving from the newest console could be its saving grace. If it can turn around or the management gives guidance that it CAN turn around its business model a short squeeze is imminent.

Why would it be inevitable?

[Notice that short interest is almost 3 times higher than its float and more than outstanding shares,](https://imgur.com/a/O3uggvr)

GME as a company is still relatively undervalued (assuming it doesn't go under). If the shorts realize that this company is not going to 0 as they have probably assumed, they will be forced to cover their shorts.

The above-mentioned condition of short interest would guarantee that they have to cover. Also considering the average daily volume, this squeeze can last much longer(3-4 days may be) than the other historical squeezes like Volkswagen short squeeze [when it became the most valuable company in the world for a short while.](https://archive.is/0sDgO)

But given that the scenario surrounding GME is unprecedented, there is no telling how it could end up other than to say that it will be MASSIVE.

[Some shorts are already under water.](https://imgur.com/a/86cGFUl) Some of them are likely covering as noted by various Redditors and retail investors who are looking at the stock tick by tick. Also considering that short interest rose to a whopping 309.83% and is now down to 297.13% (as of this writing from Morningstar data), it's obvious that some of it were covered.

The recent stock price appreciation could be a result of that plus the expectation of good quarterly earnings report.

**Retail mania:** There is considerable retail interest in this stock. Considering that this stock is being heavily promoted in [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets) and driven by that a lot of people are buying shares. According to a survey conducted there(not that reliable, but a good indicator of interest), that subreddit alone has enough ownership to get a board seat.

Open Interest in call options is also [huge](https://imgur.com/a/UvxIGqt) considering that this is only a $1B market cap company. It's filled to the brim with OTM call options(from December 4 to April and further). And market makers and option sellers would have to hedge to serve this crowd, in turn increasing the stock price.

This, in turn, could create a feedback loop where the shorts have to cover their positions, leading to a further increase in stock price, which would force market makers to purchase more shares which could increase stock price and on and on until it triggers a squeeze of epic proportion.

**Likely improving financial health:** [GME announced voluntary redemption of senior notes.](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/11/10/2124246/0/en/GameStop-Announces-Voluntary-Early-Redemption-of-Senior-Notes.html) Management has decided to redeem $125M of its senior notes. This is signalling that the company has managed to generate enough cash flow to cover its debt early.

It could even help improve its credit rating which would help it attract institutional investors more and other perks that come with improved credit ratings.

[Declining debt](https://imgur.com/a/G518yz8) is necessary as it would ultimately help deleverage the company and put it in a more sustainable footing which is ultimately what is needed for avoiding bankruptcy.

**Technical analysis:** This is not my forte. I have bare-bones knowledge in TA and only use it for entry and exit purposes.

But according to some retail investors in Reddit and tradingview GME has formed [a cup and handle bullish pattern](https://imgur.com/a/gj9pzZS).

**Analyst Upgrades:** Analysts are upgrading GME stock. Well, that's good, I guess.

# The Case For Bankruptcy

The scenario in which a short squeeze doesn't occur is PROBABLY the scenario in which GME ultimately faces bankruptcy.

As the thesis for short squeeze is laid out, the thesis for the short sellers is also crystal clear.

After all, GME is STILL a large brick and mortar store that is trying to sell a product that could be very easily purchased using the power of the internet.

The revenue of GameStop for the past few quarters is in [steep decline.](https://imgur.com/a/mTcwpIe) The company is overly leveraged and has many stores that are loss-making operations.

Its online store has much lower visibility and investment and is lacking in many aspects(in my personal view).

Its credit rating is not that good and Cohen himself somewhat criticised the management for trying to hang on to its old ways of doing things.

Gaming and associated products are bound to [thrive and grow at a CAGR of 9% and had grown even more in the past.](https://www.reportlinker.com/p05903704/Gaming-Industry-Growth-Trends-and-Forecast.html)

Yet GameStop FAILS to capitalize on this trend and is continuously losing market share while destroying its [financials.](https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/xnys/gme/financials) This is a clear sign that something is inherently broken within the company.

While the management does seem to be trying to fix things, it could prove to be too little too late.

To change its fortune it needs to turn around its business models like Best Buy or Walmart. Yet it seems pretty unfeasible judging by its financials.

GameStop had adequate time to change with the times and become an early adopter but its backwards-looking culture and late entry made its journey full of competition.

Short sellers believe that ultimately GameStop wouldn't be able to achieve a business turnaround and gain a critical mass of customers in its online space and management incompetency will ultimately lead to its bankruptcy. Thus its faith would be like the numerous mom and pop shops or the various retail giants that were.

Even if GME share rises due to retail mania and market maker hedging; institutional investor ownership could [decline](https://imgur.com/a/04i3a0g), leaving retail investors as the ultimate bagholders. The shorts may bite their tongue and keep on paying interest as long as they believe no fundamental change in the business is going to happen.

Which means they may not need to cover their position as long as the company becomes bankrupt, thus the fabled short squeeze may never materialize.

After all, most shorts are probably institutional investors like Melvin Capital who can always maintain their margin requirements and like the retail investors they can also figure out what the retail investors are trying to do and thus avoid triggering any short squeeze.

They may think, well, game sales are slowly becoming more and more digital, ultimately, platform holders wouldn’t give a shit if GME died and die they will. Because the most lucrative part of GME's business is buying and selling old games. So this will ultimately die.

Plus, game related merchandize and other products(which are very lucrative and a huge market) would still remain under the clout of Amazon, Walmart etc, so GME will not be able to survive through that business model.

# Conclusion

The next two or three quarters are pivotal for GME.

    If
    "Management decides to address Cohen's concerns and manages to show their roadmap to success and improves its financials within the next two quarters = Short squeeze"
    
    Else If
    "Cohen declares hostile takeover or something close to that line= Short squeeze"
    
    Else If
    "Management addresses Cohen but fails to deliver within the next two quarters and has disappointing earnings=Unsure" #improbable cause next two quarters are expected to be good or at least the guidance which is more important
    
    Else If
    "Management doesn't fully address Cohen's concern, Cohen also doesn't make any move yet the business improves still= Likely short squeeze"
    
    Else If
    "Management fails to address Cohen's concern, Cohen disassociates himself, business fundamentals detoriorate= Retail bagholders"
    
    Else
    "I don't know really, imagine your own scenario, you are not bound to my conclusions. In fact my conclusions could be entirely off the mark. We are trying to predict the future here. Hope you come to your own conclusions. :)

There are various nuances that I avoided writing(which are probably even more important to write) cause it might have taken too much of my time.

Been lurking here for like a year now. Anyone trading Asian markets wanna team up for a sub-sub Reddit daily/weekly mkts discourse? I think india is kinda being left out and there are UUUUGE gains potentially. Kinda tired of the vague market commentary and clueless analysts.

Been trading nifty options and just f**king around with India Industrials and Banking (pretty noob-y but I’m a meagerly student), the gains are moderate. But a more *ahem* strategized approach might be further fruitful.  

What sayeth brethren?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Closing 2020 with the greatest Bull run of the Year?🚀🌙 To my respected Retards,

Its coming babayy!!.. SPCE's in a perfect hot water jacuzzi!**🚀🚀🚀** Not too many talks about it yet. Flight updates coming in smooth. Flight window opens up tomorrow on Friday the 11th. And the 2020 Santa Rally is very very close! Anything below $35 is literally a fukin steal rn! **🚀🚀**Some institutions and big dicks on WSB were waiting for a run up with the test flight, but the SpaceX rocket explosion made them pull out early, causing a short pullback. Call it fear of not having a Virgin Galactic bull run or whatever the fuck you want!!! This spaceship is goin to the stratosphere sending the stock to the fuckin moon before year ends. Period.

While SpaceX is in the business of changing humanity, Virgin Galactic is in the business of sending rich retards to space. Making the latter more profitable in the near short term and long term. This was an untouched problem before, taking astronauts to mars and back is not the same as creating a repeatable, predictable, profitable business, launching rich retards into space for 90mins and back safely so they can post their pics n videos online! **🚀🚀🚀**1400+ rich fucks have already bought tickets and more rich fucks are signing up for the experience and for an exclusive dope ass tweet/insta post. (With a fuck ton of money in you 40s/ 50s.. would you consider buying a ticket to space?? If you thought of saying yes.. keep reading coz you've probably ignored obvious calls enough!)

Before entering into 2021, we'd have already finished with the first true sub orbital spaceship test, opening 2021 with an entirely new type of tourism! Ask your grandma why this is a huge fuckin deal! She knows better! With 2 successful test flights down already, this one's the third. It will cause a lot of noise towards year end!  Will probably give our first passengers from Hollywood an orgasm, just watching it on TV. You tell me how social media reacts when Hollywood gets an orgasm!??**🚀🚀🚀** Stock is crossing a $45 price point easy peasy! **🚀🚀🚀🚀**Recall that Feb 2020 saw a crazy 3 day bull run, stock rocketed 30% for nothing, just a normal flight!

This flight is a big fuckin deal! Additionally, the timings perfect, the catalyst's perfect, Santa rally is just round the corner, autists and humans pouring in their yearly bonuses, end of a fuckin COVID crazy year, spaceships hitting the stratosphere for the first time, a whole new fucking business ready to take off, daddy Richie inaugurating human launches in 2021 and your telling me this stock ain't worth nothin just coz they aren't earning rn? By the time its 2025, you're gonna see and hear spaceships launching rich retards into space all around you. And Virgin Galactic, this baby will have shot past the moon!

Got in on $PLTR when it was $13.90.. before it was a meme stock.. for this darling, the test flight window is lookin great, all the bulls suited up, oxygen masks on! Its your call bitches, coz this things goin up with or without you!**🚀🚀🚀🌙**

**Infobit:** SPCE ain't SpaceX. Google the fuckin ticker already!

**TL;DR**  $SPCE is very close to printing big dollars out of launching rich retards to space in a repeatable, predictable and profitable way! The stock is hitting $46-48 or higher before year ends after the test flight is done.

**TL;DR TL;DR** $SPCE is heading for the moon with or without you! Your call! Your put! **🚀🚀🌙🌙**_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ What would it look like if Ryan Cohen tried to take over GME (GME porn with STORY inside) Been running through this thought experiment wondering what to look out for if Ryan Cohen ever tries to take over GME because I think it will be very fortuitous to whoever realizes it's happening while it's happening. I also enjoy my GME porn to have a good story to it and I think I've crafted an enjoyable scene here

If I was Ryan Cohen, which tahnkfully for all of u I'm not because I'd burn this company to the ground faster than General Sherman, the last step to me trying to take over would be gobbling as many voting shares as I can. He's worth 600 mil, presumably not all liquid, but he also stopped right at 9.9% ownership because he's leaving the option open of going over 10% (or at least the impression of it). If he ticks over 10% he has 10 days to report and file. What I would do if I were him is I would plan my 10 days of purchases around earnings because that's when volume is the highest. Not only that, but that is when call option liquidity is the highest. There is 5 million worth of shares (50k call contracts) from current price to 20 strike expiring tm. There is 3 million worth of shares (30k contracts) expiring next week. He's not gonna be able to buy that many of the calls without giving away his move but again what I would do is buy as many of those as I could before I fire my final bullet to buy as much of GME as I can. Then, if I drive the price of GME over the strikes of calls that I own that works out because I'll just exercise and own even more GME. Again it's well over 10% of the float that is in calls expiring in the next 6 days up to the 20 stirke, idk how much of that he can buy without showing his hand but it's definitely going to be a helpful amount of voting power if he's really trying to pull off this take over.

Looked up what 10 days before tomorrow looked like, it was the Friday before the Monday that we gapped up 20% so there was definitely a lot of buying pressure there. GME is on, maybe. Lots of volume thru earnings as expected. Shorts definitely came through as we can see with the borrow rate spiking, price dropped 20% but I've seen intraday swings of 20% with what looked like less shorting pressure..is there buying pressure?

If I'm a speculator looking for a Ryan Cohen take over, I'm going to pay careful attention to the price action tomorrow morning. If I see a lot of early volume in the calls and then buying in the morning (buying has to start in the morning IMO coz that's when volume is highest and heavy buying can be a little more hidden) then the play is to yeet a bullet into way OTM calls expiring tm and then just fucking hold thru EOD if the trade is working in my favor.

Here's a look at 2 tech companies: one is Unity software (U) and the other 1 is  Corsair Gaming Inc  (CRSR)

1. These 2 stock looks almost the same

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/moqbywhh7i461.png?width=1440&format=png&auto=webp&s=7f15ecf5dcda6b72e4bc0b556ec8ee8e197c92f8

Both of these stocks got a little bit down right after They IPOed. However, They started their hype right after that, with an upward rangy channel

You can see the 4 dips in the channel on the Unity chart and 3 dips in the channel on the Corsair chart

This channel is a prerequisite before the price gets vertical (and you can see the same tendency in the stocks in part 1)

The curve on both of these is 75 EMA. The lower, blue, long diagonal line on both charts is the mean

These 2 stocks are well-known tech companies affiliated with software (Unity), hardware (Corsair), and gaming (both of them). Both have their HQ in the San Francisco bay area. Both are in the industry for a relatively long time (Unity found in 2004), (Corsair found in 1994).

The awareness, highly efficient market environment, and general market's appetite for tech drove these 2 stock to the hype right after their IPOs

So Why am I writing all of this?

Well, this analysis is done to the implication of the upcoming IPO $SEARS (RaughBlaux) [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k1hco2/psa\_until\_they\_ipo\_censor\_the\_words\_oblox\_and\_blx/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k1hco2/psa_until_they_ipo_censor_the_words_oblox_and_blx/)

This is a well-Known software gaming company, that is founded in 2004, released its main product in 2006.  With the real product, great public awareness, $242.2 million, around 4 billion company valuation, and the tech mania that is present on the market in the late 2010's-Early 2020's , This company has the potential to become a hype stock, a kind of a hype stock that would behave like these ones listed above.

The only weakness this stock has is the end of the corona pandemic. Although it is a minor issue in the market since the vaccine and end of the pandemic hopes have already been priced in the general market

A good time to buy? The next day after the stock's IPO

[I fucking told you guys](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k48jqi/support_the_mouse_and_buy_dis_ahead_of_december/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf) last week and Disney is now at all time highs in the after hours.

DIS now expects 300-350M total global subs across their streaming services in FY24 (inline to ahead of NFLX by that year) with a global DTC content expense of $14-16B in FY24. Disney+ alone is targeting to release 100 titles per year (releasing something new every week) and ~80% of the new content is going direct to streaming. THATS A LOT OF CONTENT.

Bigger subs and bigger spend is a combo that investors welcome (tech valuations lol) and this will help to bring those on the sidelines into the story with a clearer path to $200 (~16x $6 + $100/sh in DTC which is ~8-9x sales).
 
DIS announced that as of Dec 2, their portfolio of DTC services exceeded a total of 137M global paid subs, including Disney+ subs of 86.8M (ahead of cons at ~83M at YE and vs prior guide of 60-90M by FY24), Hulu at 38.8M (vs prior FY24 guide of 40-60M) and ESPN+ at 11.5M (vs prior FY24 guide of 8-12M).

To round all this off, Disney also happens to be a vaccine play (with regards to the parks segment overhang on the stock).

Okay, so first of all. Long time failed Robinhood investor first-time poster. You guys have helped me a lot so I want to give this DD thing a try with a stock think is going to the moon.  

It's no secret that techs stocks bring home the juiciest of tendies, but I want to talk about one I haven't seen mentioned in a little bit. 

So here's why this shit is mooning like your slow cousin ralphie when he was supposed to be playing the right field in the near future in my incredibly untrained opinion. Our friends or enemies or tech rivals or whatever you want to call them over in CHINA have unveiled [nuclear fusion](https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/energy/a34875771/china-turns-on-artificial-sun-nuclear-fusion-reactor/), so the rich bois in America are going to panic. This was days ago and I'm sure Americans in this field are shitting their pants. Here's the truth, our over-demanding, over-reactive, dying for public approval government is going to PUSH this shit. It's happening in Europe and every other advanced company. 

>Well OP who on this side of the great oceans are working on this? - You right now

**Fluor Corporation (FLR)** 

Ta da! Let me introduce you to Flour, a company with truly undesirable name to say out loud. Flour is a big construction company that works on crazy big, customized projects that have never been done. Look em up, they do EVERYTHING. But so here's why it's related. As long as Portland, Oregan can keep standing, these boys are one of the top candidates for [Nuclear Fusion in the USA.](https://www.fluor.com/about-fluor/corporate-information/innovation/nuscale-power-smr)

Now I'm no expert but I know how big headed Americans are and I know that they want to be the best so this company is mooning before your grandma kisses you under the mistletoe with her tongue and calls you jimmiie levan, her high school bf's name who has been dead for 23 years. 

Now again, I have no clue what I'm doing but here's my final verdict and TL/DR: It's about 18.00 a share now, and up 4 dollars in the last month, but it's going to the GOD DAMN MOON. I don't know the cap here but if their tests are successful I think they'll be the primary builder of these new game-changers for the entire country.

Massive run ups on multiple stocks that I’m sure you’re all very familiar with now: Arrival, Chargepoint, Luminar, Canoo. You are hearing about these stocks after they are already up 200-300%+ but what if you could get into the next big play before everyone else? I present you THE next money maker: **Lion Electric**

***What is*** [*Lion Electric*](https://thelionelectric.com/en)***?***

They are a B2B company that produces all electric medium to heavy-range vehicles

**Lion positions itself as a leading OEM in transportation electrification in North America**

[Link to youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsOuM1G2yho&ab_channel=LionElectric)

Currently **3 buses (1 shuttle bus and 2 school buses)** \+ **4 trucks (class 6, class 8, refrigerated and refuse)** that are READY TO PRODUCE AND SELL. Yes even your [Trash](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAsNQwjXDP4&ab_channel=LionElectric) can be picked up by Lion right now.

***Why would I pick Lion Electric over all the other cool EV stocks?***

Lion is more than just concepts and dreams:

· Currently 7 different trucks and buses **AVAILABLE FOR PURCHASE**

· They **ALREADY have 300+ vehicles** on the road with over 6mil miles (it works)

· Multi-year **deal agreement of purchase up to 2500 vehicles** (Lion6 and Lion8) in June 2020

· **Amazon purchased 10 trucks** to try them out; first trucks going to be delivered in the next few weeks – If Amazon likes these trucks potential to buy much more. NOTE: Yes Amazon has deals with Rivian and eMotors but they are for the VANS which is completely different than what Lion offers.

· **CN** (huge Canadian transporter) recently [Purchased 50 trucks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15U4DjRLkqA&t=41s&ab_channel=LionElectric) \- again there is a chance to increase size of order later

· **Transdev** Canada [Purchasing 27 School buses in June](https://www.transdev.ca/en/press-release/transdev-canada-invests-electric-school-buses-accelerates-energy-transition/)

· V2G technology ready for the batteries, [all the buses will have this implanted](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Ub5xWTM7o0&ab_channel=LionElectric)

· Deal with [ChargePoint](https://thelionelectric.com/img/medias/LION_Press_Release_ChargePoint%20FINAL%20120420.pdf)

· **8 new vehicles** to be produced between 2021-2022 including: **Ambulance**, **bucket truck**, Class 5 and Class 7 trucks

***What is to expect in the next years?***

USA expansion expected to be completed by 2022

· New production facility to be built in USA in order to increase production

· Allows them to brand as “Made in America” to help with sales + proximity to USA market

· Jobs open in the USA for the expansion [as seen here](https://emploislion.com/en/jobs)

&#x200B;

***Sales and revenue projection:***

Obviously, its only projections and we don’t know how this will play out but the projections are very [reasonable compared to the other EV startups](https://i.redd.it/mhgsmigxjw361.png) courtesy of [u/GullibleInvestor](https://www.reddit.com/user/GullibleInvestor/)

· Revenue of 3.6 billion dollars in 2024

· Cash flow positive in 2023

· EBITDA of approx. 16%

· Cost reduction of 50% in 2024 = better profit margins

&#x200B;

**TLDR/Conclusion**:

· Lion Electric offers huge potential to grow in the near future

· Many heavy-type vehicles not being offered by competitors yet: Lion can take your trash and soon transport you in their ambulance when you have heart attacks on red days

· Ahead of the game: Trucks and buses already beings sold (CN, Transdev, Amazon, multiyear 2500 vehicle deal) = potential to have bigger orders if these big companies like the product

· Manufacturing site in the USA to be ready by 2022 to increase production and sales

Note that they only recently started to sell the trucks and that deals are to be expected in the near future. They are able to produce 2500 vehicles a year already. They are actively presenting their products now so its only a matter of time for more deals to pop up. [Link to twitter for proof](https://twitter.com/LionElectricCo)

Everything points to huge outcomes in the future. Buy and hold.

I suggest visiting their website and watching their Youtube videos to understand the company better.

But there's one company that still remains MASSIVELY undervalued.

Now get this: they are trading at a $1.69(nice) billion market cap. that's ~74x less than what shopify is trading at right now, despite over 4x less revenue and over 4x less profits than QFIN last quarter. QFIN is also growing at a considerably faster pace and is on pace for around 14 BILLION in revenue.

First off **PLTR**:

[PLTR 5D 5M](https://preview.redd.it/obkegves9h461.png?width=1578&format=png&auto=webp&s=36a7b0ff76b77688987e2f21b4290c56026bbe88)

&#x200B;

It is respecting the hard support zone of 26.95 to 27.30 (red lines)... for some reason it loves that zone, earlier in the week it dipped to this zone and stayed for awhile before dropping down to 25 bucks but as we saw today, it exploded right back to that zone and consolidated in it before breaking that resistance for a short period of time.

&#x200B;

Like I said 27.30 is a hard wall to break but with that being said, if PLTR breaks and can hold above this resistance... 

we will see 29.15...if it holds this level

**All. Time. Highs. Baby.**

&#x200B;

[PLTR 10D 30M](https://preview.redd.it/vpkc046m9h461.png?width=1572&format=png&auto=webp&s=4b4dd643f1c0d309fa957338058e4fd352e462ac)

&#x200B;

Now **TSLA**:

&#x200B;

This dirty slut of a stock has given me one hell of an emotional ride let me tell ya...

My personal opinion... I don't think we're going under $600 again for awhile! Wednesday was a complete blood bath and it broke all the way to the 570 range if you needed a friendly reminder. 

As we saw today, people took advantage of the TSLA fire sale and instantly brought it back up to the 1HR Supply zone at around $620-622. If TSLA couldn't break that initial $600 resistance...would've been blood bath pt.2.

Keep in mind that TSLA did bounce off of 635 and instantly fell and consolidated back down to the support zone I just mentioned above. Another friendly reminder...**$635 was the support on Wednesday that BROKE AND TSLA WENT TO HELL.**

If we can break and hold 624.90 resistance, TSLA will say hello to that $635 resistance again...if we break 635

Next stop is $650

Investors are piling into wagers on industrial metals like copper and nickel, betting that coronavirus vaccines and stimulus programs will drive a boom in manufacturing activity as part of a global economic resurgence.

Prices for copper have risen to their highest level in almost eight years. Iron ore, the main ingredient of steel, is one of the best-performing assets in 2020.

And shares of metals producers, including Freeport-McMoRan Inc. ($FCX) are on a tear, climbing alongside other stocks closely tied to economic growth.

As opposed to precious metals like gold, which serve primarily as a store of value, industrial metals actually have utility. Metals like copper are used in real estate construction, automobiles and other manufactured goods.

$FCX is one of the largest copper mining firms in the world, and one of the few that are American... this could prove important should tensions between USA-China escalate and government tariffs be applied to foreign producers/sellers of copper material.

For those who didn’t read my previous posts ([1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k08ya1/dd_from_an_actual_scientist_nvax_might_not_be/), [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k35zlh/followup_dd_from_an_actual_scientist_about_nvax/), [3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k5464b/from_the_scientist_who_posted_the_nvax_dd_updates/)), I’m currently a biomedical PhD candidate and have >5yrs of experience in vaccine R&D.

&#x200B;

Due to several persistent misconceptions, NVAX is insanely undervalued and is poised to take off in the very near future due to the upcoming interim readout of their Phase 3 UK trial which will support global licensure.

&#x200B;

When I say that I think NVAX will take off, consider that it went from $90/share to over $140/share in 4 trading days on news about setbacks to AZN's trial, which is nothing compared to the impact of the upcoming interim readout.

&#x200B;

Based on \*current\* supply deals alone, NVAX is projected to supply more doses of their COVID vaccine to the world in 2021 than Pfizer and Moderna combined, yet NVAX sits at a market cap of $7.3B. For reference, MRNA and CVAC - two other companies with no marketed products - have market caps of $61B and $23B, respectively. Also consider that not only does CVAC have no marketed products, their COVID vaccine is still in Phase 2 (NVAX started Phase 3 in September) and their Phase 1 data looks weak (NVAX's Phase 1 data is arguably best to date).

&#x200B;

With the supply/distribution constraints for Pfizer and Moderna, I suspect NVAX will ink several additional agreements upon release of their Phase 3 interim data. Earlier today, Australia increased their [order](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-12-11/coronavirus-live-blog-december-11-covid-vaccine-trials/12972448) from 40M to 51M doses due to issues with an in-country vaccine.

&#x200B;

# If all of this is true why is NVAX's market cap so low?

I suspect that the *primary* reason for NVAX's low market cap is the misconception that NVAX is too far behind Pfizer/Moderna/AstraZeneca to matter because their US Phase 3 trial hasn't started.

**The market doesn't seem to appreciate that they started a 15,000 person trial in the UK on September 24th which will support global licensure if successful** (my [first](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k08ya1/dd_from_an_actual_scientist_nvax_might_not_be/) post outlined why I think the probability of success is extremely high)**.** Rarely do I see this mentioned in NYT, Bloomberg, or WSJ articles on COVID vaccine updates and as a result, I think NVAX is being incorrectly viewed as a longshot.

Although it's not definite, the UK trial will also likely be able to support a US EUA due using a trial design harmonized with US requirements. Regardless, the timing for the US market is not nearly as important due to the fact that their funding from Operation Warp Speed ($1.6B) guarantees purchase of 100M doses as long as a viable vaccine can be delivered. There are no stipulations that they need to be first to ensure purchase.

&#x200B;

# When will we get the interim readout and why is this important?

The UK trial originally had a planned interim readout at 66 events, but that's been moved up to 50 events due to anticipated high levels of efficacy (confirmed the validity of the screenshot in my last post). This means that once 50 people in the trial develop symptomatic COVID, they'll unblind and determine the percentage of people who received the vaccine versus the placebo. This type of readout is what supported the announcements made by Pfizer on 09Nov and by Moderna on 16Nov.

A positive interim readout (anything >90% effective) would be enormous because it would vault NVAX into the spotlight alongside PFE/MRNA. NVAX’s $7.3B market cap would quickly be in the rear view mirror. Full approval in the US would still require completion of a US based phase 3 trial (set to start imminently) but as I mentioned, US supply deal of 100M doses is already confirmed.

&#x200B;

Ok, so when will we get 50 events in the trial?

The official language used in company press releases says that the interim data are expected "as soon as early first quarter 2021, although the timing depends on the overall COVID-19 rate in the region." However, that was before they decided to change the threshold from 66 to 50 events. Also, their president of research also indicated in a meeting on November 24th that he thinks they'll get there before the end of the year because the trial is centered in several locations in the UK with extremely high rates of transmission.

Since I have >90% of my portfolio invested in NVAX options, I wanted to get some more confidence around the timing of when the trial would hit 50 events and put together a model to estimate a timeframe. Although this might seem like a ridiculous exercise, I actually think it's semi-reasonable due to the meticulous level of detail that the UK's Office of National Statistics [maintains](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/datasets/coronaviruscovid19infectionsurveydata) regarding COVID infections and the daily modeled incidence rates they publish.

&#x200B;

# Going through the details of the model is probably overkill for WSB so skip to the end if you dont care. I’m including it so I can get feedback from anyone with a stats background

Using public statements about trial enrollment numbers, I assume three periods of linear enrollment from 24Sep to 27Oct (0 to 5500), 28Oct to 09Nov (5501 to 9000), 10Nov to 27Nov (9001 to 15000). Per the clinical trial protocol, events are eligible to be counted 7 days following the second injection. As a result, infections for participants injected on day 0 (24Sep) aren’t counted until 22Oct (1st shot + 21 days for 2nd shot + 7 days). Screenshot below should help to explain better if that's not clear. I also assume a 10% dropout rate, a 15% asymptomatic rate, and a 100% vaccine efficacy rate (this actually makes the projection more conservative).

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3cmnb8pz6h461.png?width=625&format=png&auto=webp&s=4ccfa13f90793285b382d0f2ebeb3f9134e41654

Because the probability of infection increases over time and there are different rates of infection on different days, I treat each row of the above table as an independent group to estimate the number infections over time based on the daily modeled infection rates. A screen shot of the table I used is below.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/h5mciai07h461.png?width=463&format=png&auto=webp&s=ed9031712307e8052df3559e45397c313f47fc22

I divided each daily number by 10,000 to calculate an individual incidence rate per day and then used these daily incidents rates to determine cumulative incidence rates over different periods of time and then apply that to each group of participants in a rolling window. See below to get an idea of the calculation.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/eplpltd17h461.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=7e1c1bbb6940c5b65db7145c7cf4e236769548b4

The modelled incidence rates from ONS stop at 22Nov. For the dates beyond then and into the future, I duplicated numbers on the low end from the published period, which is probably more conservative than what we’ll see in reality. Another important difference is that the modeled incidence rates are for England (pop. 55M) but the trial is performed across the entire UK (pop 66M) which also makes the incidence rates more conservative. I’m ok with these factors being too conservative since the linear enrollment assumption is almost certainly too optimistic.

**With those caveats, my model estimates that the trial will accumulate 50 events between December 12th and December 20th.**

I think this is reasonable, however I don't have a statistics degree and am open feedback assuming anyone actually read all of this.

&#x200B;

# Conclusion and Final Predictions

We can debate NVAX’s management team and ability to deliver on manufacturing output, booster revenue, and a whole bunch of other things I addressed in previous posts but I’ll spare you bc none of it matters for what happens in the next 2-4 weeks.

The success of this trade will be based on 1) whether or not they announce positive interim results and 2) the timing of the announcement. If results are positive and they're announced in the ballpark of my estimated timeframe, then it could be an easy 500% return depending on the contracts you buy.

I wouldn’t be shocked if the stock dips a few more times prior to announcement in response to Pfizer/Moderna news, but I think we’re close to the bottom. I’m not comfortable missing an announcement so I’m not gonna bother trying to time it perfectly but keep that in mind.

I’ve settled in on a strategy of buying a few grand worth of OTM weeklies while building a core position of January 15th options on dips. Overall options volume isn’t great so I’ve been picking my strikes based on volume and have a ton of Jan 15 150c and 160c. See previous posts for proof.

If your risk tolerance isn’t high then regular shares aren’t a bad move because this is gonna move enough to still make good return and there’s potential for big swings until an announcement is made.

&#x200B;

**Final Predictions**

· Announcement of initiation of Phase 3 US trial between 11Dec and 18Dec

· 50 events recorded achieved between December 12-20; press release within 7 days of events being achieved (December 19-27)

&#x200B;

\----------------------------------------

Update

Regarding options prices, consider the price history of the Jan 15 150c:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ekfwggromh461.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=70a89f8e974e0ebbcee444ded22c6e8fbe3fb942

That was due to a jump from $100/share to a high of $145/share. Interim announcement sends this much higher than $145/share.

&#x200B;_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $MDB IS ABOUT TO SELL/CORRECT Fellow autists, here’s a little DD for you.

$MDB has gone up 16% the last week, 50% the past 3 months and 148% over the past year. Today they have ran up another 13% on no fresh news. Don’t get me wrong, this stock looks great for long term, it’ll most likely be 400$ by end of next year, but the short term has too much hype behind it, a lot of these simps trying to get into the next biggest software. 

Yesterday, 12/9, they reported earnings. Overall Q3 was a loss but Revenue surged almost 38% year over year, at 150.8 million$, and surpassed the consensus mark by 8.9%.
They also added 2,400 customers by the end of the quarter, and 2,800 direct sales customers.
They currently have 14.9 million in free cash outflow, but they have raised their expenses in research and development(R&D), and general and administrative (G&A) expenses. G&A expenses increased 21.3% and R&D increased expenses by more than 33%.

So what?
Piper Sandler maintains an OVERWEIGHT rating, increased price target from 310$ to 328$
Da Davidson kept a neutral rating, raised price target from $250 to 275$
Goldman Sachs maintained a neutral rating as well, raised price target from $245 to $280
Canaccord Genuity raised price target from 290$ to $315
Oppenheimer keeps outperform rating and price target of $300

IMPORTANT. Also if I may add, put options are down over 1000$, and are pretty much free money lying on the ground, you don’t want to walk past this...

Now there was no company specific news today, but the tech sector as a whole had a rally yesterday before rapidly selling off into after hours. Today was just continued momentum off of earnings. 
This company faces a lot of short term challenges. They’re waiting on lawmakers progress for stimulus negotiations to move further, and Analyst Ittai Kidron wrote one a research not to investors, “while management still appears conservative near term, we remain bullish given stronger customer usage/growth trends. 
Now I have full belief that long term they will continue, but based on others in their sector such as OKTA, and CRWD, $MDB is due for a correction. Based on the fundamentals and technicals, they’ll fall back to around 300$-285$ and hold their previous highs as new support levels. Which would be 285$-300$, consolidate and continue to push up. 
Yesterday’s sell off wasn’t a correction, it was sector based, and nothing to do with the actual company. Today’s run up was just giving it room to fall back and consolidate to push higher into 2021.

I have 290$ and 295$ Puts for 12/18/20, I won’t be holding these until expiration, plan on selling before Wednesday next week!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ #WeWantCohen GME 2021 Listen, there are enough long GameStop (GME if you can't read) posts. I'll cite a few worth reading if you can & haven't yet:

\*Infrastructure and Energy Alternative has options now… were added recently. Also has warrants.

THIS IS NOT A SPAC. HAS NOT BEEN A SPAC FOR OVER 2 YEARS.

(Infrastructure and Energy Alternative is a renewable energy construction company that has grown massively since its SPAC days in 2018. At the time the company was pulling about 460mm of revenue, and now has a back log of about 2bn +, while also becoming cash positive (last 2 quarters they posted positive eps, with the latest at .33 eps). EBITDA increased from 36mm to a whopping 125mm. Infrastructure and Energy Alternative currently trades at roughly 6x EV/EBITDA.

What does this all mean?

If you have been paying attention you would notice a lot of green energy companies have been flying. We are looking at insane valuations for certain companies which are all becoming overvalued. Infrastructure and Energy Alternative is NOT overvalued and is in fact the opposite and WAY UNDERVALUED. This company has a market cap less than 260mm but pulls 2bn in revenue (and is currently profitable AND still growing). Infrastructure and Energy Alternative has a P/S of 0.13…. madness.

With Biden’s 2 TRILLION infrastructure plan, Infrastructure and Energy Alternative is poised to pull in more and more revenue while winning more contracts. In a few years this is a company that could potentially be pulling 8bn + revenue if they keep up the same level of growth since 2018. They also do civil work but 70% of their revenue comes from renewables. They are #1 in Wind and #12 (and growing) in solar nationwide. In their last CC they highlighted the fact that they will continue to focus on solar and are looking to cement more and more contracts in this area.

They currently sit at $11.35/share with the warrants at 1.53. Current market cap is about 250mm.

My short term target here is $20 per share, which is still under 500mm market cap… so even at $20 this is laughably undervalued. Infrastructure and Energy Alternative has a small float (around 23million OS) but heavy insider ownership so the tradeable float is actually a lot smaller, so this can move quickly with enough volume. I have been watching this and with only 1million in volume it has pumped 20-30% in a day. The ATH of mid-14s was just a few weeks back and the stock has slide since then (there has been no bad news… possible manipulation here). So at the very least, you SHOULD see around a 50% gain short term as Infrastructure and Energy Alternative should surpass recent ATH.

Infrastructure and Energy Alternative in comparison to other companies:

RUN: Has over 200m shares os and 10-13B MC, with only 875m annual Revs and 8.9m Net Profits. Infrastructure and Energy Alternative Revenues and profits are greater.

ROAD: 1.5bn Market cap (6x greater than Infrastructure and Energy Alternative market cap) and trades at x12 EV/EBITDA (double Infrastructure and Energy Alternative). These guys are a construction company as well… but focus on roads (obviously) and have nothing to do with the bullish green/renewables sector. Also less revenue than Infrastructure and Energy Alternative. ROAD eps is a bit higher though.

There is a looming 1bn massive solar project from Invenergy. No contract award has been announced yet but Infrastructure and Energy Alternative is definitely in the picture. Infrastructure and Energy Alternative HAS A HISTORY WITH INVENERGY. This is the largest solar project in USA history. If Invenergy chooses Infrastructure and Energy Alternative again for this project you best believe the stock is going to moon. I repeat, Invenergy and Infrastructure and Energy Alternative have a history of doing work with each other.

I like the warrants more that the commons, why?

Below is roughly what the warrants will trade at in comparison to the commons:

Commons – Warrants

11-13 – 1.50  
14 - 2  
15 – 2.50  
16 - 3  
17 – 3.50  
18 – 4  
19 – 4.50  
20 – 5  
21 – 5.50  
22 – 6  
23 – 6.50  
24 – 7  
25 – 7.50

A double from here in the commons (11s – 22s) is a 100% gain while $22 commons would result in roughly $6 warrants, so roughly a 300% gain from the current $1.50 warrants price. This is just short-term mind you.

Warrants cannot be called in by Infrastructure and Energy Alternative unless the commons trade over $24 for 20 out of 30 trading days. WARRANTS EXPIRE IN 3 YEARS. These warrants are like a 3 year call option….. even at $25 a share the market cap is still only around 500mm market cap.

The fundamentals here for Infrastructure and Energy Alternative are strong as fuck and you can play this in many ways: go long (set and forget) the commons, send it with options (options became available a few weeks ago!) and/or go with the warrants and possibly make fucking bank.

The bear case?

Infrastructure and Energy Alternative is a construction company. Margins are thin. BUT, revenue has grown by 4x in 4 years and is poised to continue growing. They have become cash positive in this time and profitable. There is no indication that this should change. All signs point to continued growth and improved margins. They have already stated the plan to pay down debt (around 300mm) so that alone will increase EPS and margins.

If you look at the historical chart. You will notice Infrastructure and Energy Alternative got hammered after it merged. This is because Infrastructure and Energy Alternative took on debt to buy civil construction companies to diversify its portfolio of renewable construction companies. There was also expressed interest by Oaktree and Ares wanting to buy the company out for under $6 a share and as a result the stock dwindled lower and lower. The buy out was rejected by the company and as it started to improve covid happened, again crushing the stock. Even when the company was “only” pulling 500mm in yearly rev, the price was undervalued, and now were sitting at 2bn revenue and growing.

Comparisons to PRPL situation:

Recently Infrastructure and Energy Alternative filed an S-3 shelf registration that hinted that up to $500m could be raised in a secondary offering to fund future growth and possibly to acquire more companies. Purple also had multiple secondary offerings. If you look at PRPL's growth from $8 to $16 to past $25, each rally was after a secondary offering of the founders reselling their existing shares to institutions. Secondary offerings are good for companies that are growing. They expand institutional support (which also creates support levels for the stock) and increases float so that daily volume goes up. Purple's offering was non-dilutive while Infrastructure and Energy Alternative offering might be dilutive. However, there are only 23m shares outstanding for Infrastructure and Energy Alternative right now. If Infrastructure and Energy Alternative had even 100m shares outstanding, a $20 stock price would be a $2B market cap, with revenues projected to exceed $2B in 2021.

Disclaimer: I am in the warrants and will be holding these for a while. My first target is at least $8/warrants. I think $10 warrants will happen here though (commons need to hit $30). PRPLW hit $30 commons and $10 warrants and im confident the same happens here.

These are all charted on a 180D/4H candle chart.

**$DOC**:We have an ascending trendline that it just tapped into. Under is a support area, and we have had consistent higher lows through the last few months. It is below both EMA lines so it needs to break these to have true strength. If it breaks price resistance over $18.00 - this is gonna be a runner!  

**$GOOS**: Great ascension and uptrend over the last 6 months, now making a new channel. IT showed life at our $30.75 support area, and this is above our 70% volume area - which is a great sign of life here. All indicators cannot get lower, so we have plenty of room to run!  

**$HLT**: This stock loves to make a move up to a new channel, establish itself, then do it again. We have a beautiful move up and now a new channel. It showed life before and now has room to run, and even has a chance to make a newer channel over $111. The stochastic cannot get much lower, and MACD is about to cross. It is above all 3 EMA lines as well, beautiful setup.  

**$JCI**: What a beautiful trendline up! We are now at the bottom of the channel up, support, and 50EMA which it respects as well. It has plenty of room to run and if the trend continues, the longer you hold the more you will make until this channel is broken. It is a gorgeous price action setup.  

**$PEAK**: 3 month uptrend and the stock is slowly reversing right in this channel. No coincidence it is coupled with a support, and the top of our 70% volume area as well. Stochastic and RSI oversold, so it has plenty of steam up.  

**$ROK**: Up trending channel again today; and is right in the channel which is beautiful. It is trying to break this resistance at $251; and if it does it is going to make a beautiful move. Indicators show neither good or bad signs, it all comes down to this potential reversal right here.  

**$SILV**: 7 month horizontal channel that is still moving along. It is in the point of control volume area so it is extremely powerful in terms of being a support. If it lives here you can easily see 15% profit at our next resistance. Indicators are also in the middle so not good or bad at this point, both EMA lines are above so keep that in mind.  

**$WDAY**: Gooooooorgeous uptrend up, and it is right above this line. It is coupled with a support and a 200EMA line, and all indicators show bullish days ahead?! Yea.... this is beautiful. 

Happy Trading; Comment for clarity or questions._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ BUY THE CRSR DIP🚀🚀🚀 So..... You might have heard about Corsair. You know that company that made half of the components of your 5000$ PC.

The company had quite a good run up recently but some fucker analyst made it crash. You might have missed out on the first run but it will skyrocket AGAIN! The public float is really small its 91% owned by institutions, so the price moves easily. That means apes together strong. Gaming has increased massively during the lockdown, in q3 Corsair reported net revenue of 457M a increase of 60% YoY. Their operating income of just under 50M had a 353% YoY increase! They are extremely undervalued at only a 3.2B marketcap.

Here is a visual DD for you that are mentally retarded. Moral of the story is BUY THE DIP, and together we will make it🚀🚀🚀

POSITIONS: shares at a average  of 38$_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Raise your hand if you’ve loaded up on some Spicy 🌶 PFE calls 🚀🌚 _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ How long till Dash and Uber buy this tech? _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ RIP CentOS (2004-2021), Death to Watson! Please for the love of all that is holy, and more importantly, for the open source community, dump IBM! They have murdered CentOS which for you non-techie degens, is the holy grail of linux server OS's. No hate to the Ubuntu gay bears.

**Some actual DD though:**

**Context:**

Ya'll know how the software development life cycle works right? Alpha -> beta -> release candidate -> stable (overly simplified fyi). Red Hat Enterprise linux was sort of like the RC in that mix and CentOS was the stable. Stability is highly important and valuable to business everywhere.

**So the fuck what?**

What IBM has done this week is announce that instead of CentOS being the stable version, it will become the beta version. On top of that, the current version of CentOS (8) was promised to be supported to 2029. With this change, CentOS 8 will only be supported through 2021. 1 year to deal with this situation is just not enough time for many large organizations.

**What does this mean (aside from fuck watson)?**

This straight up means a fuck ton of companies are going to bail on CentOS and ostensibly, Red Hat altogether, to move to a more stable operating system such as Ubuntu Server.

"BuT wAiT! MoRe PeOplE wIll jUsT bUy ReD hAt EnTerPRisE LinUx fOr mOar MOnEyz!!!"

No they wont, fuck you, and fuck IBM.

Positions: None, I sold them today, asshole.

tl;dr:

fuck IBM, jump ship and bail before literally everyone who uses red hat products does.

Good link on the matter if interested: [https://itsfoss.com/centos-stream-fiasco/](https://itsfoss.com/centos-stream-fiasco/)_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Comparing Warrants and Options I have a non US broker that doesn’t offer options on Tesla. They do offer a few warrants though at some strike prices/expiration dates. 

The warrants they offer gives the right to buy/sell a 100th of a Tesla stock in the future. So I was wondering if you could compare the price of the warrants to options prices by just multiplying it by 100 (or 100x100 depending on which price you look at). Of course with the same date and strike price.

Is there any difference between the contracts that doesn’t make the comparison possible? They should have the same volatility and price movement right?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Regarding Tesla's S&P inclusion, can ETFs/Funds use derivatives to skirt around the requirement to purchase shares around the inclusion date? Seems crazy to me that these professionals would be forced to buy TSLA shares from the open market from speculators around the inclusion date.  Wouldn't these sophisticated folks have work-arounds to this? Like using derivatives or something?

The fact that the S&P committee decided to go with 1 tranche instead of 2 tells me that the feedback they received from tracking funds was that it wouldn't be too disruptive to do it all in one day. 

Can someone with related experience chime in?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Who else 💎Hands on SPCE for tomorrow? EDIT: I sold most of calls when SPCE hit 34 and bought a 12/18 PUT at the same time. I paperhanded a few of my calls when they shot down early in the morning. Congrats to whoever made money!

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

3 Day ban cant stop me!! Anyways does anyone have 12/11 calls for SPCE tomorrow? I was down -50% on mine on monday now im back up to +3%. What are everyone's expectations for tomorrow's test flight? Im guessing Stock price will close EOD at 34-36 if successful, with a selloff right after successful launch. Remember folks tomorrow is Friday so take your gains and rest this weekend. The rest of the month is looking green.

&#x200B;_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ 5k -> 60k ->10k -> 50k -> ? I just wanted to share my options journey. Started during the crash where I peaked at 60k, got bent by some witches. Tried to chase and ended up with 10k left. Made a new account on a different server and started gaming again. Made it back to 50k on some Spy, Wynn Resorts, and Wayfair plays. And that leads me to now. I've got 60 250C for Wayfair expiring tomorrow. Not sure how it'll go, but I thought this might cheer up someone who lost a lot and is down.

Also for those of you with good intentions, I'm 22 and pulled out 5k before I did this play. I'll be fine, just another pricey lesson.

With that being said, If Wayfair gets to 260 I'll donate 10k to charity. Pretty unrealistic but who knows.
