It doesn't matter if you win by an inch or a mile; winning’s winning’
- Dom Toretto”
               - twtregg 

With that quote as a guiding principal, here is how to win by an inch 3x a week for $75k+ a year in gains.  Just remember as you read this post; Winning’s winning.  


The Vin Diesel Trade:

1. Monday - sell 8-12 delta $50 wide call or put spread on SPX exp Wednesday (or both - doesn’t really matter if you pick calls or puts, do what makes you happy). This will usually get you $175-$200 credit for $5,000 in buying power per contract. I been doing 4 contracts for years now. 


2. Tuesday - Drink, watch Vin, smoke, etc. doesn’t really matter. Point is, don’t do anything to the Monday positions.  Do nothing. Maybe you use this time to do something productive, like read some shit self improvement book. 

3. Wednesday - 99.9% of the time you simply close Monday’s position for between $25 and $10 then put the $175 per contract profit in your pocket, thank Vin and move on.  That’s 3.5% in 2’ish days.  At 4 contacts I usually make $500-800 bucks. 

For that 0.01% of the time you are in the money... well use your judgement and either close for the loss or grow some balls and wait the day out.  Personally, I am pretty aggressive to close when I find myself ITM on exp day, but honestly, more times that not it would have been better if I just waited until near the close to exit... but I don’t read any of those shit self improvement books, so little self control.  Also FYI, at $50 wide spread it’s almost impossible to hit max loss. 

4. Wednesday after you have closed Mondays position - Open a new position with the same deltas as Monday to expire Friday. Ie. sell 8-12 delta $50 dollar wide call or put spread exp Friday. 

5. Thursday - Do literally anything but fuck around with your Wednesday position.  Seriously, just don’t. 

6.  Friday - close Wednesday’s position for $175 profit per contact.  Thank Vin.  Then open the same 8-12 delta $50 wide put or call spread exp Monday. 

That’s pretty much it.  I know this is not ‘new’ and I know there are 100 different ways to manage all this. But honestly, this is simple and it works.  Is it as sexy as a TSLA $20k yolo... yes. Yes it is. 

Now go off and make some money for once in your shit lives.

Gonna describe the second graph and this applies to the first one two. Basically what I think will happen to game leading up to march and post march has happend twice, albeit with a failing buisness in 2013. The shorts increase their positions. In both massive peaks in the stock price their was a new console cycle. Now with closing unprofitable stores and increasing the eccomerce, revenue is lower but MARGINS are higher. the shorters are well above 100% in relation to the outstanding share count, the price is currently in discount zone, and calls are cheap and puts are getting expensive. The fair price of GME based on FCF is around $22, and all this paired  with stimulus and vaccine news and the biggest console cycle in US history could be a big enough catalyst that the share price rises enough to start a feedback loop of margin calls and hence a massive squeeze._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ VLDR; (Velodyne), our shiny chance to visit Pluto 🚀🚀🚀 No, not really, but close we will get!

Vax development ship has sailed for WSB. Pharma is a closed off wanker game.

The next big play in covid-land, one of the few left we can join and make big bucks is...

DISTRIBUTION.


I've done lengthy DD which I'll type up if this post gets enough traction, long story long there's not that many ultra-refridgerated distribution enterprises. Corporations around the world are scrambling to provide the infrastructure to distribute this vax. It's going to be an estimated $10BB< market.
Ford and a slew of other boomer crap are M&Aing like nuts, but they're way too late and bloated to get a sizeable chunk of the business.

We need to look for already established businesses verticalized in similar sectors, ideally having both manufacturing refrigeration systems and components, as well as strong geographically distributed logistic networks. And most importantly, some which are small enough to x500% - anything else isn't WSB worthy.

But how do we know this wont be a bearish pennant pattern that reverses down?

For anyone who is retarded, market cap is how much the investors value the company. This means that if the price doubles, the amount the investors value the company doubles.

...

Aphria's Market Cap: 2.3 Billion

Assets: 2.5 Billion

Liabilities: 660 Million

Revenue: 560 Million

Revenue Growth YoY: 134%

Cash on Hand: 500 Million

Short Term Debt (1 year): 170 Million

Long Term Debt (1 year+): 490 Million

...

This is a growth sector, the cannabis sector is expected to grow larger every year and Aphria has been taking market share from its competitors.

Aphria just acquired US weed-themed beer brewery and distribution company, Sweetwater, their gateway into the United States and their revenue will show up on future earnings.  And while other LPs are stuck with plain packaging, Aphria will be advertising their brands to the target audience plastering Riff and Solei on Sweetwater beer cans, totally legally. 4d chess.

We're sitting at the bottom bois, we're going up.

TLDR; Buy APHA. It's forming a large bullish pattern and it's extremely undervalued.

The biggest reason I bought into this scam is the console cycle that was going to make us tendies. Like all of you, I did not take one fucking minute out of my life to do the simplest DD you could think of. Let's look at the previous two console cycles for Gamestop. 

The ps3 and xbox360 got released on november 11, 2006 and november 22, 2005. Gamestop peaked afterwards around December 7, 2007. Indeed, console cycle would have made you some nice money here. But people are not fucking retarded. We are not DD gods for figuring this out. My grandmother's dead chihuahua could have figured this out, in fact she probably did. 

So what happens in the next console cycle, with the ps4 released on November 13, 2013 and the Xbox one on November 22, 2013? Gamestop started mooning around January 2013, peaking on November 8, 2013. BEFORE the release. Let alone earnings. 

Now when did Gamestop start mooning again? End of August this year. In fact, it went from approximately 4 dollars a share to a high of around 20, a short while after the release of the consoles. Non-idiots bought a long time ago, sold for profit. This company is only going down. 

But what about Cohen? Remember that he bought quite a while ago and has a nice profit already. In his position, why not sell? Of course he could still takeover, which is not a guarantee that this company will do good in the future in any way. What is he going to do after most consoles are sold? People are buying their games digitally. The biggest profits from gaming are not anymore buying games, it's buying stuff in games such as Fortnite, League of Legends and Counterstrike. Something Gamestop will never be able to profit from.

Oh btw, Scion capital, that Autist named Burry's company, sold over 30 % off their share in November.

&#x200B;

I expect that FOMO is just beginning on this one. If you haven't read my post about the risks associated with this play then please look at my post history. I also belive the insane volume is indicative of large tutes buying in, but who knows. Grasso's mention on CNBC is just the beginning IMO.

This still feels like an asymmetric risk to reward as paysafe is a solid company in a very Niche gambling space with room and leadership that can accelerate its growth into other adjacent markets.

Take this DD from your neighborhood genius asian man and friend of WSB. 

China's Domestic Issues:  
\-Car ownership is rising in the millions as the middle class income is rising along with its soaring population. So is China's air pollution problem--a huge issue and international embarrassment.   
\-China is the world's 4th largest oil producer, behind the United States. This is not enough oil for China's voracious demand, so they must import tons of barrels from OPEC nations. Of course, they don't want to rely on them. Who does? Will they go to war with them like the US has done in the past twenty years? NO! Because the Chinese want to rely on a more tech-driven solution. 

EV's. Nio is an answer to many of China's problems. With battery swap technology making battery charging more affordable and faster for the driver, Nio's EV ecosystem will net billions of dollars from China alone. EV's used to be for the rich. NIO will increasingly make cars affordable for the middle class. Also, imagine if GE or Toyota made money off "fuel" in addition to selling their cars. That's what NIO will do with their subscription-based charging stations. 

International Upside:  
\-Why do you think China accepted Tesla into their country and not other businesses like Amazon, Google, or Facebook? Well, they say there's no free lunch. China wants to sell their cars to the United States. China also wants to set up EV charging stations throughout the US as Tesla will do in China--this is the next gas station business. Imagine Standard Oil level income for NIO!!!   
\-If the US doesn't agree with Nio, then China will say, "bye bye Tesla".   
\-Europe is a lock. NIO has offices in UK and Germany. Like it or not, Europe is swayed by China's money in a way that the US is still not. 

Comparables:  
\-If you wanna see how China will do in the future, look no further than Japan and South Korea. Very similar in every respect. Japan thrived after it transitioned from an agrarian economy to a manufacturing one, of cheap electronics and cars. Then it transitioned into making quality products, right after they hosted the summer Olympics, like Sony, Toshiba, Toyota, etc. It was made possible due to the Japanese people's industriousness, denial of self, national pride, and quite frankly, Asian smarts.   
\-Similar thing happened in South Korea--transitioned from making rice to making cheap manufacturing of electronics and cars. Like Japan, they're now in the process of making quality products--the surge also happening after around the time they hosted the Summer Olympics in '88. Think Samsung's phones. Think higher-end Sonatas, or LG flat screen TV's.   
\-China? China has been a manufacturing powerhouse since the 2000s. But millennial sand boomers should remember all the cheap "Made in China" jokes. This image is slowly fading as China now has Huawei, Alibaba, Tencent making new innovations in AI and commerce. This again, happened after what? The 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing.  
\-So where the hell are the Chinese cars? Where is China's Toyota, Honda, Hyundai, or Kia? 

NIO!!!! Unlike Toyota, Hyundai, etc. China's manufacturers can scale to levels no other country in the world has ever done in the past.

Nio will outgrow Tesla even if it doesn't make it to the United States. But Trump is no longer in office, and I doubt Biden will be capable of doing anything meaningful to stop Nio's rise. 

CEO Upside:  
\-William Li has a perfect track record. He took a failing Auto-Review company, invested in it with his own money and became its CEO. Within years, he IPO'd it on the NYSE, making himself and fellow investors billions of dollars.   
\-Forget Jack Ma, William is often called the Steve Jobs of China. That Elon Musk Battery Day flop? It will never happen with NIO. William has an immense eye for detail.

Update: forgot to mention inauguration too. VIX underlyings tend to weight toward a month out, so definitely going to have impact. Thanks for the reminder /u/evotrans 
———————————————
I really hate VIX because it can be frustrating, but I have read way too much about it.  This reading has led me to believe that the time is very right for VIX, in a way both bears and bulls can benefit from, contradictory to what I assumed last week.

Tried to write this fast since my VXX calls are up like 50% from this morning [whatever time this was](https://twitter.com/yourboymilt/status/1338496770985271297?s=21)

**VIX is a measure of volatility; it is not solely a measure of SPY inversion** as many people like to think.  I go in depth [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jfhdta/volatility_for_dummies_vxx_uvxy_vxx_and_spy/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf), but as people want insurance on their stonks options premiums go up--the VIX underlyings are a measure of this.  TA totally works for VIX since it works for everything, but it is also very, very subject to macro principles and fundamental analysis; in other words, VIX tends to follow the fucking news, especially for things that may have an effect a month or two out.

**When looking for VIX pockets I’m not looking for SPY weakness, I’m looking for causes of market participants to want to insure **their individual equities and hedge SPY.  We have a few occuring right now:

**Bearish causes for premiums rising:**
**FOMC meeting tomorrow and Wednesday;**
because the market may make a critical decision regarding the purchase of treasuries, market participants are likely to have concerns about their holdings and seek insurance.  Higher premiums, higher VIX

**Stimulus talks and potential failure**: I don't have a lot of time to review how FUBAR these talks have gotten, but holy shit.  The ideas likely to pass include minimal UI insurance extension, or conversely no direct payment.  There is chatter that McConnell is holding back the stimulus, purposefully, so that the budget can count against Biden's deficit for the 2024 presidential run.  Once I heard that, my optimism waned.

**Prolonged Brexit talks**: Surprised that /ES didn't seem to care last night when UK/EU opened trading, but this has just as powerful a market effect, probably even more so, than the US stimulus.  It's be utter catastrophe economically 

*Don’t forget, VIX can move when SPY is down but it can ALSO move when SPY is up:*

**The Bullish case for premiums rising:**
FOMC meeting: if the FED caps the long term treasury yield, stonks could soar, causing a rise in vlatility

**Stimulus talks:**
if the stimmy goes through, a sharp rise in SPY can cause a volatility explosion as people insure swift gains
**More vaccine news:**
Vaccine news coming fast and furious from various companies **will likely cause a spike in DIA and a drop in QQQ—that dissonance and potential major sector rotation** is the type of premium-driving event that causes big volatility explosions.

**The point is, if you look at VIX as a measure of premium measurement as insurance, there are several outcomes that could jolt us, and that shockwave will cause a rise in premiums.**  VIX is also trading absurdly low for several economic outcomes, so there is that too.

I could be wrong and VXX could keep getting its ass whooped, but I don't think I am.

**VXX 12/24 18c**
**VXX 1/8 18.50c**
**VXX 1/15 20c**

**TLDR**: With VIX (and VXX and UVXY) being a measurement of volatility on either direction, and so many potentially major decisions coming to break us out of relative flatness, volatility is poised to end the year strong whether bull or ber r fuk.

The issue was between porches' current Volkswagen stake (will not sell, will only acquire more), the institutional investors stake (will not sell), and index funds (will not sell), the shorts were out of luck.

In the GME scenario, there are those sitting at 600% profit from buying GME at $2-3 who will take their profits at every opportunity. Another group is those who bought at the top and will likely sell near breakeven to mitigate their loss. The last group is the speculators who just want to make their money and get out. 

Even if GME does have an insane amount of short float, the number of sellers will prevent any squeeze for ever happening.

Using my throwaway for this one, but I am not an employee of LOB I just work in the banking industry and have been following these guys for a while.

Live Oak Bank (LOB) is the number 1 SBA Lender in North America and one of the best banks for the future. How you retards have missed this, I have no idea. Its unbelievable what they do, how they do it.. First an SBA Loan for retards that do not know is a government backed loan by the Small Business Administration that can take most of the risk from the loan by backing up a large principle amount and allowing the bank to make net interest income with minimal risk to spur small business growth.

Leadership: Live Oak Bank is headed by a man, Chip Mahan as CEO. Chip was responsible for the S1 online banking system and founded the new bank in Wilmington NC. He is pretty unorthadox but appreciates hard work. Under his guidance, Live Oak has grown enormously and is about to upend banking through technology, VC/strategic investments, and not being a fucking retail banker.

Neil Underwood is the President of Live Oak Bank and of the Live Oak Bank VC arm, Canapi ventures. Neil helps eye up the strategy of technology and partnerships through Canapi. Canapi is a fund of 86 other banks, that once a FinTech gets investment from Canapi, it almost guarantees 86 large customers. [https://canapi.com/our-companies/](https://canapi.com/our-companies/)

Live Oak Bank is HQ'd in Wilmington NC as its one and only branch. LOB runs 3 Private Jets with pilots and airline staff as employees of the bank. Those aircraft are what Chip deems their flying branches, where they fly to cities around the country to close on SBA Loans. Yes. They fucking fly on private jets to do sales calls.

They also keep a number of experts on hand as either consultants or employees to help advise customers on building out their small business. Going to build a veterinarian clinic? They got actuals Vets that will advise you on SEO, signage, marketing, and partnerships to grow your clinic. You want to open up a Storage units? They got a guy that will go into such great detail to advise you on the right concrete and exact dimensions to utilize for maximum benefit to your business. LOB is like Rick from Pawn Stars - they got a guy for every business and they're all exceptionally successful and give your business access to these folks.

Now the bank does give out loans and businesses are hurting, but they have such a great story around this. If they determine the cashflow of a business is not doing great, they intervene when they sense trouble with their experts to help turn their loans around. Which is why they have such a low default rate on their SBA loans in general compared to every other bank in the US. Plus they sell off loans too.

Now here's where I get excited. The Bank says they are a tech company that operates as a bank. This is 100% true. A software IPO that came out this year was nCino. You know who basically created nCino? LOB. Thats right, Chip Mahan and Neil Underwood were behind nCino and i think still have some investment individually in nCino. nCino is a full on massive Commercial Lending and Bank Operating system that uses Salesforce as a backend database essentially. In Backing its THE system every bank has to have because its so easy for management to make sure their lenders are doing more than playing golf. And they are also HQ'd in Wilmington, NC.

Live Oak is also heavily invested in Apiture, an online banking system that was formerly part of First Data, but spun out after the Fiserv acquisition. Apiture is an independent entity and just raised $20 million.  They are going to be one of the first online banking systems to take advantage of the new "Open banking" and API capabilities. (seriously banking is so outdated).

There is a core system that Canapi is invested in (does the GL work of the bank) that i have no idea if Live Oak will use it but my guess would be yes if it works. They will likely be backing Greenlight (which is a FinTech unicorn).

# Humble Beginnings

So I mentioned unlucky positions when first starting off. Totally out of your control type unlucky. My first position a little over two years ago putting all my savings of about $20,000 into Lam Research. A bit after holding, [the CEO got #MeToo'd for his sexual misconduct in the work place with his hot lady assistants.](https://www.mercurynews.com/2018/12/06/lam-research-ceo-quits-following-misconduct-charges/) You know what happens next.

# Fuck The Stock Market

I pulled all this money out a year and gambled most of it away playing blackjack. Thankfully think I've recovered from this addiction, but it was painful for a long time. Lying to family what I was doing and where I was. I had such a rotten experience in the stock market and wanted nothing to do with it. I really thought I had better odds in a shiny casino with chicks handing out drinks and diamond chandeliers. This lasted until this year. I put my remaining money and incoming paychecks into my account and diversified. But like you, I had no idea the coronavirus was coming and that I would be in **deep shit**.

Other bigger IPOs such as ABNB and ABCL grabbed the most attention and CERT could be greatly undervalued.

A good comparison for CERT would be SDGR, also in the biosimulation market. Biosimulation is the computational simulation of biological processes, which greatly accelerates drug development while saving costs. Certara provides virtual trials to test for toxicology, drug-drug interactions, and efficacy among populations hard to reach by traditional clinical trials. On the other hand, SDGR focuses on the drug discovery process by simulating physics-based molecular interactions. However, Certara has a revenue of $200m, while SDGR's revenue is around half of that. Certara also turned a profit and SDGR did not. Additionally, CERT has [more than twice the employees of SDGR](https://www.owler.com/company/certara). In my opinion, market share and size are key in a brand new market like biosimulation. In Certara's [form S-1](https://sec.report/Document/0001104659-20-126924/#tMDAA), we see a consistent increase in bookings and 90%+ renewal rates, indicating great customer retention.

Certara's service also includes regulatory science. Basically, CERT streamlines the process of regulatory paperwork via natural language processing. Using its expertise in biosimulation, Certara incorporates virtual trials into submissions to fit regulatory guidelines. As the pharmatheutical industry sees increasing use of computational biology, Certara's regulatory science service will certainly generate more profit in the future.

Right now CERT is trading at around $36 with a market cap of $5.8B. SDGR is trading at around $70 with a market cap of $5B. With twice the revenue and employees of SDGR and having turned a profit, CERT is currently undervalued and set for the moon, especially with the ongoing market boom._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Sell QuantumScape (QS), secure profits, and re-enter in two months!

QuantumScape (QS) is ripe for at least one bad catalyst between today and the end of the year. The catalyst(s) will end the blockbuster event re. the share price.

What catalyst could it be? Another competitor's update on solid-state batteries (not just Toyota)? Short seller "research" tweets like the one against LAZR? Bearish price targets after initial analyst coverage, like the HYLN coverage by GS and JPM?

Could it be an insider selloff of NKLA shares on December 21 itself, courtesy of Private Investment in Public Equity (PIPE) investors? Could it be a similar transaction... closer to home?

Formycon : Innovative SARS-CoV-2 Blocker from Formycon Completely Prevents Infection of Cells _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ FEYE breach and its affect For those that dont know, FireEye (FEYE) was hacked via a SolarWinds (SWI) breach a few days back. SolarWinds was the point of access into FireEye systems and a ton of FireEye pen testing tools were taken. Both companies are used in a ton of US Fed agencies. FireEye saw a $2 drop from 15 to 13 during that, but it doesnt look like SolarWinds has moved much. This breach was tied to the Dept of Treasury and Dept of Commerce so far.

&#x200B;

I work for a Govt agency in cyber security that uses both these products, and I can say that our particular agency is currently (9a ET today) discussing future action on using these product. The general opinion of both of these products within my agency is usually pretty happy with both products from what I've seen (though I work closer to FireEye than Solarwinds I have access and dealings with both).

&#x200B;

The news for solarwinds seems to have come out this weekend, so I'd try to look for a dip today possibly.

&#x200B;

Positions: none, but if I got some I'd look to buy the dip on FireEye, and potentially SW if it drops to the $20 range. Also perhaps wait for the dip and sell cash secured puts. I'd look for $10 strike on FireEye and between 15-20 for solarwinds depending on where/if the dip goes to._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $SPY Forecast 12/14 Key $SPY lvls: 362.21, 364.36, 365.34, 365.65*, 366.53, 367.20, 367.99, 368.42, 369.27, 369.62, 369.95, 370.82, 371.05 + (ATH)

Short and simple with not many levels to work with at this area, guess a good thing. Got the 9ema at ~367, a break below 365.65 is all hell break loose. Looking to hold 367 for a complete push higher towards 375-380. 

Bullish scenario🚀: Gapped up and opened ~367.80. Next channel up is 368.42-369.27. Will need some volume there. A push at open would prob do it. Once 369.27 breaks and holds, look to head to 370.54-370.82-371.05+


Bearish🩸: Look for 367.80 to break and hold. If that happens next stop down is 367.20 prior sell area. Next channel down will be 366.53-365.65 (prior ATH vaccine pump level) look for some consolidation or a bounce, scalp more puts here. Last possible stops down will be 364.36-362.21. Unload all puts here and be on standby

This Week Stock Earnings Reports [12-14] **Are stocks going to benefit from the Santa Claus effect this year? What’s the latest news in the stock market? This week earnings reports & more**

**\~Very Long Post\~**

Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let’s start with the recap of Friday, as we saw the [DOW](https://ibb.co/XF2RH8q) finish in the green up .16% but closed the week down 0.57%, while both the [SP500](https://ibb.co/CBm2qZQ) which lost .13% on Friday and .96% for the week and the [NADSAQ COMPOSITE](https://ibb.co/RbY68rn) also down .23% on Friday and 0.69% for the week struggled to recover after a very bad start to the trading day. We also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/C68dbNJ) finishing the week at a new high, over the 23 levels, as the volatility index has seen a spike of over 12% in the last [week](https://ibb.co/0F78Vtm).

You can see that a big majority of the companies were on the decline on [Friday](https://ibb.co/NCBm6Bg), with low volumes, as only around 10B shares traded hands compared to 11.5B shares in the last 20 trading days, as some profit-taking combined with some healthy corrections in stocks have moved the markets slightly lower.

On a factor [basis](https://ibb.co/k1HTXfs), value plays suffered on Friday, especially small and mid-caps, while growth was pretty flat, with only Energy and Financials lost more than 1% on Friday, as Energy was the only [sector](https://ibb.co/ynW3BzJ) to finish in the green this week, up 1,21%, while Real Estate lost almost 3% and Financials also lost almost 2% in the past week.

Here is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/cNCSPHk) from Friday, not a lot of green to be seen, with the exception of Microsoft, Disney and Toyota.

While for the week, pretty much the same can be seen in the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/rfcfdL6), as Disney, AT&T, Elly Lilly and Toyota were the only big gainers.

[Here](https://ibb.co/fXLgKLc) is the most interesting economic data coming out this week with Wednesday and Thursday being the biggest ones, as we get a better read on what the economy is doing, while also getting the Federal Reserve latest and last decisions for this year.

[Today](https://ibb.co/M9GFCFf) we get the electoral college across state capitols formally casting their votes, while On Thursday we also get the Moderna vaccine FDA Ad Com voting process and results.

The Fed doesn’t really have many [options](https://ibb.co/p44t6C0) at the moment, but they can still move to buy longer-term bonds or decide to buy even more than the current monthly allocated program. The Fed is not expected to cut the benchmark rates anymore, as they are already near 0.

So, I think we might start to see some of the Santa Claus [effect](https://ibb.co/1KF6gJC) starting very soon, probably sometime between this week and the middle of next week, as you can see in this chart, the SP500 has posted very good returns in the past 70years on average in this period, but yeah, who knows after what has happened this year.

Also, you can see in this [chart](https://ibb.co/2YMgNSK), that the big tech stocks have underperformed the market since the start of September, as small caps have outperformed, I think we might finally see some of the big tech names start to gain some momentum once again, especially Apple & Amazon.

I think this might happen as more of the big cash flows that are sitting on the [sidelines](https://ibb.co/8dpv9gd), might finally start to be move to the stock market.

While on Friday we saw the consumer [sentiment](https://ibb.co/Vpc4Hfs) jumping more than expected, but is still way [down](https://ibb.co/5FTD721) from a year ago. We also got the producer price [index](https://ibb.co/jDTTkgb) for November which rose by .1% and is up .8% year over year, more than expected.

[Here](https://ibb.co/hLkWLYz) are the most interesting earnings report for next week, I am especially interested to see what Jabil, FedEx, Nike (Friday) and Blackberry report.

I think we can see great number from Jabil which will benefit from the iPhone 12 sales, while FedEx, the largest parcel delivery service in the world is on watch, as they are considered a proxy for the global economy. With Nike also expected to report strong numbers with an increasing number of physical stores re-opening and a strong boom in direct-to-consumer business.

Guys, [Disney](https://ibb.co/xfB6Qxz) saw a huge pop in the stock after a great investor day, but i won't go into more details as i have previously posted about them.

I also wanted to mention this, but I guess you already know this by now, the [FDA](https://ibb.co/8rPL1q2) gave the green light very late on Friday while the [CDC](https://ibb.co/kMkxfFf) also formally signed off in the weekend.

The first deliveries of vaccines are expected to reach more than 150 state locations [today](https://ibb.co/D9XjNyR) with another 450 locations in the next couple of days as the vaccine began to be packaged and shipped on [Sunday](https://ibb.co/84mzTwG) morning. So yeah, I guess we can keep the tradition of Vaccine Monday going. If both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines will be available, with the US just exercising the [option](https://ibb.co/QkCFhW6) to buy another 100M doses from Moderna, the US is aiming to vaccinate 20M this month, 30M in January and another 50M in February, that would bring the total to over 100M people.

[Walmart](https://ibb.co/n6wJKvx) has started to mobilize to help with the distribution, while [CVS](https://ibb.co/qkWYTJx) also has plans to begin vaccinations starting next Monday.

Guys, just wanted to mention that I came across this [tweet](https://ibb.co/K5fsgxN), I think it pretty much sums up the latest IPO frenzy that we had with [Doordash](https://ibb.co/Rzq7g9F) and AirBnB, with both in my opinion starting trading at insane valuations, that aren’t really justifiable.

The big IPOs this week, had a big influence on the markets, as investors probably had to sell a lot of stuff to buy into DASH & AirBNB, this might have led to an imbalance in the markets. As people who used market orders were forced to sell stuff to fund the buying of these 2 highly overvalued stocks in my opinion.

Just look at this [chart](https://ibb.co/9VpnfS7), as the average first-day return for IPOs has seen a huge spike in the last year, with an average of 37% first day return this year. But, just look at the % of [IPOs](https://ibb.co/V339X8N) with negative earnings also increasing since 2010, that just doesn’t seem to bother investors, as they are looking for fast growing companies that don’t emphasize earnings.

Just a fact, [AirBNB](https://ibb.co/S3QFQ64) became only the 3rd tech company to open with a market cap over $100B, the only others ones being Alibaba and Facebook.

After this 2 crazy IPOs some of the next [companies](https://ibb.co/J5BRZ8f) that planned to start trading last week, Affirm and Roblox, delayed the plans, as this companies seek to determine the right price for the shares and the right company valuation with advisors, so they don’t leave money on the table like AirBnB and Doordash have done last week.

My opinion is that if you don’t like these high-flying IPOs, don’t short them, just avoid them and buy stocks that you really like and expect to have great growth

We also saw a [report](https://ibb.co/86vpGyP) from The Information, which is not actually doing any reporting of any specific deals, that presented their next logical M&A deals, this led to the [stock](https://ibb.co/D1VGXwj) of Dropbox to spike almost 14% including after-hours trading and [MongoDB](https://ibb.co/mHPQw0L) to gain more than 6% on Friday.

Other [news](https://ibb.co/5GJBH1w) came for videogames and video gaming consoles which saw a record $7B in sales, over 35% more than last year, bringing the total to over $44B for the year, with more than $1.4B spent on news consoles from Sony and Microsoft just in November.

While in the EU, [Brexit](https://ibb.co/YPQRhqv) talks keep getting extended time and time again as the EU and Great Britain still are trying to figure out some sort of a deal.

We also found out what companies are getting [kicked](https://ibb.co/4Y74VFQ) out of the SP due to the inclusion of Tesla and that the latest [shutdowns](https://ibb.co/C5116dp) for the holidays have been extended more than usual.

Let’s hope for a great day in the market as the [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/Zzf0FVN) seem to be pointing at a good open, hopefully some green action continues after that.

LCAis merging with Golden Nugget Online Gaming into GNOG Friday, 12-18-20. Discounted now after last week. Stop gambling on meme stocks like broke degenerates and bet on the online gambling industry like big money degenerates. TL;DR at the bottom for your short attention spans.

You heard of **Draft Kings**? Remember how much that stocked  jumped up? **$10 to $50 in 3 months, that's a 400% increase.** Did pretty well didn't it. It's been the only publicly traded online betting company on the stock market till this week.

**Landcadia Holdings II LCAis merging with  Golden Nugget Online Gaming to become $GNOG on Friday 12-18-20.**

The upsides on this company are huge:

* **Net Revenue of $25.9 million compared to $13.5 million during the same period in 2019, an increase of 92%**
* **Gross Gaming Revenues of $28.9 million, compared to $14.9 million during the same period in 2019, an increase of 93%,**
* **Operating Income of $8.2 million versus $4.2 in the third quarter of 2019, an increase of 92%.**

**The  owner is Tilman Fertitta, billionaire businessman who owns the Golden  Nugget casino and betting chain, the Houston Rockets and Landry's Inc.  which is the parent company that owns the franchise rights to Bubba  Gump, Joe's Crab Shack, Morton's steak house, Rainforest Cafe among 40  other popular restaurants.** He also owns  a variety of other properties and business ventures.

"In 2018, his net worth was estimated at $4.5 billion, placing him at No. 153 on the [Forbes 400](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbes_400) list of the wealthiest Americans;[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tilman_Fertitta#cite_note-ForbesBillionaires-1) *Forbes* calls him the "World's Richest Restaurateur".[\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tilman_Fertitta#cite_note-forbes3-6) "

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landry%27s,\_Inc.#Properties\_and\_subsidiaries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landry%27s,_Inc.#Properties_and_subsidiaries)

The downs sides:

The  only downsides I have found is that LCAwas created by Tilman, which  some people find sketchy, but makes a lot of sense to me. He was looking  to bring his company public and wanted extra investments to bring one  of his most successful companies public.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Online  betting is an ever growing industry and in my opinion Golden Nugget is  the only other online gambling company worth investing in besides Draft  Kings.

The global online gambling  market size was valued at USD 53.7 billion in  2019 and is expected to  grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11.5% from 2020 to 2027.

Full Disclosure: I obviously have shares in this. 

TL;DR

LCAis merging with Golden Nugget Online Betting on Friday, 12-18-20 into  $GNOG. Last weeks shit fuckery dropped it down and I think it'll drop a  little more on Monday, making it a good time to get in on the only other  publicly traded online betting company besides Draft Kings. It's got 4  days to rally and I think it'll pop hard on merger.

This  is finally a SPAC with an actually valuable company behind it, a successful billionaire owner and a huge injection of money coming.  I am  willing to bet that this online betting company will start to moon  starting on Friday's merger vote or the following week after the ticker  changes._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Puts on SolarWinds 💸💸💸 after security breach US Calls On Federal Agencies To Power Down SolarWinds Orion Due To Security Breach

&#x200B;

🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

For my next round of some fundamental DD, I'm going to be building off of my overall view for the next 6 months of investing in the Chinese consumer - specifically, looking for overlooked companies in the **Chinese Consumer Discretionary** space.

Unfortunately, the call I'm making here currently *does not offer options yet*, but when they do launch, this Company exhibits all the right attributes to make a first post-IPO earnings play / LEAPs on.

*So why the fuck am I posting this on WSB if there are not YOLO options plays available?*

Because there is a high probability that there will be a rotation out of all of our favorite meme stocks as 2020 winds to a close (it may already be happening). This, plus the return of mass upside Call option buying has driven some outrageous premiums on options & as of now, most are on the expensive side. I would make a whole post on this with some nice cool charts & shit, but even the sentiment of the memes posted here should tell you enough.

Overall - *When WSB starts to even question if a bubble is forming, you know you should be treading very carefully.*

So get your tendies & park them in a SPAC or some shit or follow me into China's Becky until the next meme arises.

With that said, here we go:

**I. Overview of "Why" Chinese Consumer Discretionary:**

Here's a quick overview of the 14th 5-Year Plan:

[ China's 14th 5-Year Plan - Additional details in late Q1'21 \/ Early Q2'21 ](https://preview.redd.it/r1ecvs2lc4561.jpg?width=586&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8d7c6dc21f460a98880944c3e83caf9cee0f1c85)

On top of fiscal support for these new industries - China is arguably ahead of the entire world in terms of handling COVID-19:

[China is already ahead of pre-COVID levels in terms of GDP](https://preview.redd.it/pbkosj5nc4561.jpg?width=1028&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b309957f8684e420a10e754f71dee9fc1057f3b4)

Also look at some on the ground pictures of activity in China as of 3Q'20:

These guys are miles ahead of dealing with COVID compared to the West.

**II. Bet on the Emerging Chinese Becky - Yatsen Holding Limited (NYSE: YSG)**

[From YSG S-4](https://preview.redd.it/xml62sfrc4561.jpg?width=609&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b68f257aed3f6e6c2850637374caa9d9c43ec385)

Some high level stats:

* Founded in 2016 - priced IPO on 11/19/20 led by Morgan Stanley & Goldman Sachs
* China is the **largest beauty industry in the world** with **$38.8 billion** in retail sales in 2019 \[1\]
   * YSG as of 9/30/20 only has a 1% market share with year over year revenue growth of **+377%**
   * If including overseas sales by Chinese cosmetics companies - totals **$79 Billion which is nearly \~2x the size of the next largest market (USA)**
* China also has one of the largest Gen-Z & Millennial populations in the world with 171.4 million Gen-Z & 231.5 million Millennials as of 12/31/19 \[1\]
* YSG currently has 3 brands: *Perfect Diary, Little Ondine, Abby's Choice, & recently acquired Galenic*:

In addition - **Wall Street pegs the Chinese beauty market to be a $160 Billion industry by 2025E ($79Bn in 2019)**

**What's so unique about YSG?**

**\~90% of their sales come from DTC channels vs. peer average of \~56%**

https://preview.redd.it/zc9hypqyc4561.jpg?width=1260&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=76b0453285198dd676fc8cee4b1b072e495e754b

All have legit Consumer/Retail experience, CEO/CSO/COO seem to be college buds. CFO is a board member of one WSB's favorites here, XPEV, & has a great track record serving as CFO in numerous public companies. CEO/CFO are also Harvard alums, which is a big buy-in to the waspy Wall Street crowd.

**III. Financials**

Here's a quick snapshot with some cool circles & shit on parts I want to talk about:

https://preview.redd.it/guzulkf0d4561.jpg?width=618&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f6b75e83e847abb5dbf9c67bbaa28ed7a87d095b

So far we've laid out the upside in the **Revenue growth** case. Historically, they've grown Revenues at a clip of +102% CAGR LTM as of 9/30/20.

On top of this extraordinary growth, there are some things that can be financially engineered as well.

First off - Gross Profit Margins at 63%, while slightly better than the COTY/Kardashian GP Margin of 57%, it's still a ways to go vs. L'Oreal's GP Margins of 73% \[2\].

**Why is EBITDA negative?** This is driven by their bloated S&M + G&A expense that clocks in at 56-62% of Revenue (vs. other Chinese brands at \~41% \[3\]), which would be a cause for concern, HOWEVER, the marketing strategy is ***working***, evident in their inventory turnover of 98 - 110 days (shit is flying off the shelves)

* COTY's comes in at 135 days, L'Oreal at 141 Days \[2\]. Compared to their Domestic cosmetic company peers they are only bested by Proya by less than 10 days.

This all culminates into a business that has a cash conversion cycle of 37 days (among the lowest in peer group) with many levers to improve on this that I won't bore you with here. For the curious that want to do their own DD, look at their Payables structure. There's a ton of improvement that can be done here.

**With all this said - Wall Street estimates +78% growth in Net Revenues by 2021E which is woefully conservative, but I'll be using their estimates for the next section on Price Target**

To end this section, there's a ton of concern for Chinese-listed stocks being very scammy in terms of accounting. While the risk will always be present, it's important to note that one of the largest early investors is Tiger Global Management with billions (\~202mm shares, \~30% of total) tied up on YSG. Tiger Global Management is one of Wall Street's preeminent hedge funds, so I'd expect them to know their shit: [https://www.tigerglobal.com/home](https://www.tigerglobal.com/home)

**IV. Price Target**

At current price of $16.55/Share - they trade at 7.3x EV/2021E Sales & 5.1x EV/2022E Sales. **Important to note: Sales CAGR through 2022E is expected to be +60%, the highest in its compset & a discount to their CAGR so far of +102%.**

This is vs. the entire beauty comp set of 3.3x / 3.0x, respectively - on average Sales CAGR through 2022E of +**10%**. YSG is expected to grow at ***6x*** the comp set.

What about vs. Chinese peers? 4.7x / 3.9x, respectively on +**19%** Sales CAGR through 2022E. YSG is expected to outpace their growth by **3x.**

*So what's the right multiple?*

I'm pegging YSG at 11x EV/Sales on average between 2021E/2022E EV/Sales - this is a **20%** discount in growth vs. their Chinese peers which shakes out to an exit price of **$27.75 per Share or +70% from Current.**

On the Technical side - look at the chart. Long story short: huge volume on big 'up' days, very low volume on 'down' days. Get your magical crayons working.

**TL;DR.🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 Invest in the Chinese Becky (NYSE: YSG) for potential +70% gains from Current until the Options market gets a bit more affordable.🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀**

### Multifactor models

This is the bread-and-butter for quant funds. AQR has pioneered this space the most.

Multifactor models are models designed to extract cross-sectional risk premia in markets. Put simply you look at all the stocks in a market. Rank them based on some metric(s). Long the top decile. Short the bottom decile. If that market-neutral portfolio outperforms on a consistent basis then well done! You have found a risk premium. 

Classical and well known risk premia include: 

* Momentum - stocks that moon continue to moon.
* Size - small caps tend to outperform large caps.
* Value - high-value stocks tend to outperform low-value stocks.
* Mean Reversion - some securities are stationary e.g. volatility.
* Quality - quality stocks tend to outperform low quality stocks. 
* Low Volatility - low vol stocks tend to outperform on a risk-adjusted basis.
* Aggressiveness - conservative companies tend to outperform aggressive companies.

Some of these factors used to work but no longer do because the mere fact that so many quant funds discovered them caused the alpha in them to decay. Most quants I know are looking into more alternative factors using machine learning based on sentiment, web-traffic, social media mentions, etc. I'll elaborate further down.

Book Recommendation: [Quantitative Equity Portfolio Management by Ludwig B Chincarini](https://www.amazon.com/Quantitative-Equity-Portfolio-Management-Construction/dp/0071459391)

### Writing and Pricing Derivatives

This is another bread-and-butter for quant funds. It used to be a lot bigger before 2008 when the street had more appetite for exotics. But it's still good business. It was pioneered by quants like Ed Thorpe. You should definitely read his book the man was friends with Claude Shannon ffs - [A Man For All Markets by Edward O. Thorp](https://www.amazon.com/Man-All-Markets-Street-Dealer/dp/1400067960).

Writing and pricing derivatives involves six easy steps. 

1. Create a model that can output synthetic prices and has parameters you can tune.
2. Fit the model to a stock or portfolio such that it produces synthetic prices that have the same statistical characteristics of the underlying stock or portfolio.
3. Sample tens of thousands of possible future market scenarios in a Monte Carlo simulation.
4. Compute the payoff of the derivative in each scenario.
5. Discount the future values to determine the expected value of the option.
6. Pad the price to take into account counterparty, model, and specification risks.

Now for vanilla options you can do this on a calculator using analytical methods. But for portfolios of assets or complex derivatives with nonlinear payoff structures you often need to build a pricing model yourself. This is what I used to get paid to do for big corporates looking to hedge things like generators for power plants.

What kinds of models are used here? Stochastic processes or (maybe) generative machine learning models.

### Market Making and Latency Arbitrage

This is what the big funds like Citadel, Jane Street, Two Sigma, etc. are doing. Full disclaimer I've never worked on the HFT side of things but I'll explain it the way I understand it. Comment if you want to add or correct.

High Frequency Trading firms like Citadel, Jane Street, and Two Sigma get paid by exchanges by provide market liquidity. They are market makers always ready to buy or sell whatever share you or a large institutional fund needs to trade. They make money by placing a limit order to sell or a buy limit order in order to earn the bid-ask spread.

Latency arbitrage is when HFT firms buy and sell the same security at the same time in different markets because two or more exchanges are displaying a different price for that security. For example, if a whale pushes the price of a security high on the New York Stock Exchange then an HFT firm might sell the security on the NYSE at the same time as they buy it on the Chicago Stock Exchange and profit the spread between the two exchanges.

Book Recommendation #2: [High Frequency Trading by Irene Aldridge](https://www.amazon.com/High-Frequency-Trading-Practical-Algorithmic-Strategies/dp/1118343506/)

Book Recommendation #3: [Flash Boys by Michael Lewis](https://www.amazon.com/Flash-Boys-Wall-Street-Revolt/dp/0393351599/) - this one has pretty mixed reviews amongst the quants I know (some of whom do this stuff for a living). Ken Griffin even called it a "work of fiction". But it is a great story and regardless of the plot the technology and infrastructure used for HFT is accurately portrayed.

### Statistical Arbitrage

This has gone pretty mainstream. I'm sure most of you have heard of pairs trading but it is certainly another staple for quant funds. And if you read [The Man Who Solved The Market](https://www.amazon.com/Man-Who-Solved-Market-Revolution/dp/073521798X) about RenTech (the most famous quant fund in the world) they allude to doing something similar with basket options. Nobody knows how true that is.

Statistical arbitrage involves identifying securities that should behave similarly and going long the one which is relatively undervalued and short the one which is relatively overvalued. In the simplest case you might say that Coca-Cola and Pepsi are a pair and go long/short them when depending on how they are priced relative to one another. 

In a more complex trade you might go long off-the-run treasuries and short on-the-run treasuries because older identical treasuries sell at a discount to those hot off of the money printer. This is the trade that caused the famous LTCM crash. What happened is Russia defaulted on its debt and the demand for on-the-run treasuries skyrocketed. LTCM was short on-the-run treasuries and got squeezed. Their models told them to double down multiple times (martingale) but the distortion continued beyond the point where they could borrow money to finance the trade. So they went insolvent and the Federal Reserve stepped in to do a bail out. This all happened in 1998!

The LTCM example might not qualify as "statistical" arbitrage since the securities are identical so it is literally arbitrage ... but the risk models are statistical and use the same techniques as we use when writing and pricing derivatives.

### Information Arbitrage

The most modern reincarnation of quantitative finance involves identifying information arbitrage opportunities with alternative data. Alternative data is any data that is not price data or fundamental data. Large audio, text, document, video, click stream, etc. datasets are all examples of alternative datasets that could power information arbitrage.

Here are some strategies I have seen or heard of being used,

* Using natural language processing algorithms to read tens of thousands of news articles a day to track sentiment, named entities mentioned, events, etc. This is pretty well known.
* Using high resolution satellite data to (1) track ships coming in and out of ports, (2) count cars in Walmart / Target parking lots to estimate revenues, (3) estimating the amount of oil in middle eastern oil reserves based on the shadow cast on the structure. This is the kind of analysis built by [Orbital Insights](https://orbitalinsight.com/).
* Using meteorological models to predict when the monsoon season will hit and how extreme it will be and what the impact will be on certain crops like sugar which are very sensitive to it.
* Using temperature monitors in European rivers to predict demand for natural gas and heating oil. I heard from a quant that at a certain °F nuclear power plants can't use river water for cooling so they slow down causing a spike in demand for gas ... not sure how true that is but it's an example of information arbitrage.
* Using flight path information to predict mergers and acquisitions between major companies.
* Using web-traffic data from SimilarWeb to predict which online retailers or hotel chains are most likely to have the best earnings this quarter. 
* Using click stream data from Robinhood to predict what meme stock is going to be the next pump and dump on r/wallstreetbets. You all know that this is a thing right haha ;-).

Not a lot of good books on this topic yet but I've heard that [The Book of Alternative Data by Alexander Denev](https://www.amazon.com/Book-Alternative-Data-Investors-Managers-ebook/dp/B08C4NSBWF) does a half decent job. You'll probably find more ideas browsing parts of Reddit though like /r/datasets.

So that's what quant funds do. We build multifactor models based on (mostly) fundamental data. Write and price derivatives. Make markets at high frequencies. Buy and sell securities and portfolios that are stationary relative to one another. And beg, borrow, buy, or steal your data in order to predict what you or funds are going to do. 

Quant funds look more like the NSA today than any Wolf of Wall Street type boiler room. It's just racks of computers and 1000's of nerds geeking out over maths, stats, and code. And very very few of us use technical analysis. 

Technical analysis involves _prediction_ based on price and volume data. Most quants strongly believe that predicting the market based on price and volume data is impossible. None of the business models I mentioned above involve any prediction of future prices. The only claims we make about the future are about probability distributions.

I don't hate technical analysis. I personally don't think it works, but I could be wrong. But the claim that quant funds are based on technical analysis hasn't been even close to true since around the 1970's.

P.S. About me - I'm a quant. I've been doing this shit for 10+ years. 4+ in the back-office pricing exotic options for big corporates and helping them hedge complex transactions. 6+ in the front-office mostly building strategies based on multifactor models and information arbitrage principles.

Their stock in June of 2008 stood at $297 - today it is $20. Facing a demand >>> supply situation not as great as we are at today. 

I expect MT stock to increase by a minimum of 300-500% in very short order.  

This is for a trade only and not long time hold. 

It will increase over the next 8-12 weeks and accelerate after earnings until supply catches up with demand and it will. 

It did and the stock dropped to $78 by October 2008.

Schnitzer Steel

https://www.schnitzersteel.com

Massive recycling play here - these are the guys that supply scrap for steel manufacturing to companies that are “mini-mill” Electric Arc Furnaces that melt steel scrap and make rebar and other steel products. 

Scrap prices just increased here in the United States by $90/ton - the largest increase since 2008. 

In May 2008 It was trading at over $100/share. 

Today it is $29/share. 

I have common and smaller option positions. 

This too will skyrocket and then trade out in early summer.

Vale like, MT is vertically integrated with mining and manufacturing. 

May 2008 - $40/share

Today it is $16 share and on a blue sky trajectory - it will be $30 by March, maybe sooner.  

Najarian is all over options on this one. 

Google anything regarding “steel prices” and all you are going to see is exactly what I’m telling you - we are going to see all-time highs in steel prices next year and steel stocks are quickly going to move hot and fast.

Yep.   I made $16k in 24 hours by playing against MMs move to max pain on the last options expiration.  


Proof:

https://preview.redd.it/q2rmkpgtm2561.png?width=1242&format=png&auto=webp&s=b4964298a012ca2bc8535d44a85909f6403bc2a1

I sold 400 30p 11/20's for \~$0.40 each for about $16,000 in profit on the day before expiration when the stock price was about $29.70.   Why did I take such a "risky" move?   Because PRPL religiously follows max pain when it isn't in the middle of its mid-quarter run up.

# What is Max Pain?

I'll spare you my own detailed explanation and let you google it yourself (or for the lazy, start [here](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/maxpain.asp)).

Basically, Market Makers' delta hedging actions, in the absence of an underlying or external force driving movement in the stock (aka news event), will force a stock to land at the max pain price on options expiration.

No, it isn't some sinister coordinated action against you.   It's just the math of the position and strategy that Market Makers take.

And yes, this is a controversial topic in some circles, but so is Wall Street Bets.  Those circles are clearly stupid on both accounts.   We know what we are doing here.

# Why don't all stocks follow this and how come everyone doesn't just play this?

Two words:  retard strength.  Never ever, ever, ever attempt to play this against a stock with a constant influx of retards buying up positions on the stock (looking at you Tesla!), aka retard strength.

Retard strength and major news events present a gamma risk to the market makers and can cause movements in the underlying price of the stock that they are unable to "manage" to the same degree.  As the market makers are constantly trading their hedges, new buyers (or sellers as it may be) can provide price support outside of max pain targets.

***THIS*** is exactly why PRPL is PERFECT for max pain plays.   Outside of its traditional late-quarter run up into ER, PRPL is about as boring as it was for your date your first time in bed.    There's very little short-lived action and nobody is talking about it much the next day.

# PRPL and Max Pain

[Historical Max Pain Data from Opricot](https://preview.redd.it/qey2gnwvp2561.png?width=701&format=png&auto=webp&s=0609d0a040260fa5c1f22b7044647f39f7974108)

Let's look at how well PRPL has tracked against max pain, EVEN for post-ER price action.   See, PRPL tends to get very excited on the run up to ER (it blows its load early), and disappoints when it is time to score (Joe Megibow, while a great CEO, is the anti-Elon-Musk in terms of ER excitement).   For max pain plays, this is perfect because there is no external price support outside of MM's driving to max pain.

Even for the infamous Q2 ER that I called wrong, PRPL ended at max pain just days later.

PRPL works really well for max pain because there is an inordinate amount of option activity compared to a relative small amount of stock volume.   It's the perfect scenario for a MM to maximize their strategy, but it makes PRPL price action ***PREDICTABLE.***   If you can predict the price and the timing, you can make money using options (and stock trades), ***ESPECIALLY*** because PRPL tends to have fairly wide swings between expiration dates (noted above).

All you simply need to do is make a play on an outside swing betting that it will return to max pain, and voila: tendies.

# What are the risks?

Clearly, you are in the wrong sub if you just asked this question.   For the benefit of the outsiders who don't truly belong here:

1. max pain is a moving target
2. max pain can't be perfectly calculated
3. news events can break the pattern (which is why this works on boring stonks with high option volume relative to stock volume)

**Max Pain is a Moving Target**

https://preview.redd.it/ck0rcxoer2561.png?width=1528&format=png&auto=webp&s=a7b6678cdd1cc09e0131252a19b0abfb4c1d7c42

Our very own [Swaggy Stocks](https://swaggystocks.com/dashboard/options-max-pain/PRPL) has one of the best max pain calculators I've seen ([this one](http://maximum-pain.com/options/PRPL) is ok too, especially if you don't want to pay for Opricot).   Towards the bottom of Swaggy's is a historical max pain chart which helps explain that max pain is a moving target.

People are constantly buying and selling options.   The net of the open interests and strikes is the max pain price.   So, max pain can move on you after you've made your play (which is why I wait till closer to expiration).

**Max Pain Can't Be Perfectly Calculated**

While we know open interest and strikes, we don't necessarily know WHICH SIDE of the play the market makers took on each play.   This doesn't invalidate max pain theory, but it presents a risk that should be understood when making these plays.

If you assume that the market maker is always taking the short side of an options play, you will likely be generally correct (because who's theta gang, really?  Oh right, me.), and can rely on max pain as a guideline.

**News Events Can Break the Pattern**

An inordinate amount of volume from a news event or retard strength can break max pain theory on a stock (see the PRPL expirations BEFORE ER that are the run up to ER).   I probably won't play January on PRPL, but I'm playing December.

# Prediction and Positions

My prediction is that PRPL ends very close to max pain of $30 again on 12/18, which would represent a nice movement up from the close on Friday of $27.435.   Of course, you autists could all pile in and move the max pain target on me, but I thought I would take that risk and share this.   Assuming you guys don't bring retard strength in a bad way (move max pain and then deflate the price action activity at the end of the week, allowing a max pain ending at a different price), then we will see $30 by week's end.

https://preview.redd.it/gc0yec3at2561.jpg?width=932&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8cd9b05b0f7797c4ec37da569b4c170cab2f7cc3

I'm playing 100x each of 25c, 30c, and short 30p.   All 12/18's.

This isn't investment advice, nor a recommendation, but for you autists who can't put two and two together:   shares and ITM calls.

If you guys jack this up, then lesson learned from me, and I'll never remind you of this again.   You will all forget about it like the goldfish you are and I'll play it again after next earnings for some tendies.

# Technical Astrology

You all know what I think about Technical Analysis.    Confirmation bias at best, and a cheap fortune cookie most likely.

The Technical Astrologers on Stocktwits are calling for similar price action to the 30's next week based upon magic charts:

https://preview.redd.it/jrr7a86du2561.png?width=687&format=png&auto=webp&s=57f9a6cbef45634f68cef6cdbb7e8f23b7269c21

I shamelessly swiped this from some guy's post calling for a double bottom, which means things are looking up.    I don't know about you, but a double bottom means a threesome to me, which means things are looking up.

I put about as much weight into the above TA as this:

https://preview.redd.it/85sylewmu2561.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=ddb4395192ae24c5f4a1975bbc42aeb65af3444b

The above is still related to double bottoms and threesomes.   Clearly she didn't take into account her own game when making this stupid COVID rule.   For any man or woman brave enough to take that on, it counts as a threesome.   Legally.

The in-between skin on rolls is usually purple, so buy PRPL.

# The Big Boys are Doing It

BlackRock increased its holdings by 53.7% in PRPL during 3Q, according to their latest 13F, so they know own about $36.3M in PRPL.   Vanguard also increased their position.

I'm very bullish still long term and think we'll see this baby in triple digits in the next two years easily based upon their announced manufacturing capacity and the fact that they still sell everything they make.

There's definitely opportunity in short term plays though._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ PLTR will go up this week and save the West this century PLTR currently sits at a $50B market cap. Insane right?

AWK is a company that supplies drinking water to lots of municipalities. If you guys saw the recent article on Bloomberg, youll realize how important water is for the future: [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-06/water-futures-to-start-trading-amid-growing-fears-of-scarcity](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-06/water-futures-to-start-trading-amid-growing-fears-of-scarcity)

This company has operating margin of 33% and net margins of 17%, which is higher than 80% of the companies in its field. It is in a great financial position, and has no trouble raising debt to finance its expansion, as everyone will lend to them. They are continuing to grow year over year. 

COVID has hurt some of this companies revenues, as a lot of the industrial sector had to shut down and they didn’t use as much water. Now that things are beginning to open back up, this could also be an opening up play as well. 

The implied volatility for these options are also very low compared to its historical volatility. The current IV is sitting at 24%. This means that the underlying stock doesn’t move as much, however when it does move because the options are so cheap, realized volatility can become greater than implied volatility, causing your options to go high. A lot of the tech stocks have insane IVs, and its getting harder and harder for the realized volatility to be greater than the implied volatility. (Although it does happen – see TSLA). 

This company will not be a 5 bagger. However because the IV is so cheap, and the fact that historical vol is 32% and current vol is 24.7%, the options are dirt cheap, and you can easily get a 80-100% if the stock rallies 6% on far dated contracts.

Overall, this is just a low risk option play and stock. This is a company with great fundamentals and isn’t going anywhere anytime soon. They are continuing to grow, and will become more important as time goes on.

So before you take out the torches and pitchforks, I’m not here to shit on options. Heaven knows that some of you with an IQ of a doorknob are sitting pretty on white sand beaches with your meme gains. And others among you who are much smarter than I’ll ever be can wield your contracts better than I can tie my shoelaces. You’re deadly and I salute you. I’m writing this for the fraction of you that know you need leverage to escape the life of a cubicle jockey but constantly find your pockets empty because of high IV and theta. There’s another way. Use warrants. So, full disclosure, I’m no Mr. Miyagi when it comes to this type of trading since I’ve only been doing it for the last year, but it has worked well for me and I can save you the trouble of making the same mistakes I did. If you already know how warrants work, skip the first section.

**What is a warrant and why should I care?** 

They’re like baby calls that theta can’t kill you on over the course of a few months. It’s like an agreement you make with a company that just started publicly trading. Each time you purchase a warrant, you now have the right to someday buy one share of common stock AT the price specified in the warrant contract (strike price) regardless of what the common stock is trading at. But the catch is the common stock has to be more valuable than the strike price before the warrant contract expires or your warrant is now worthless. The time period before expiration is usually 5 years after they were issued. As the common stock increases in value, the value of the warrant increases at a much faster pace. Also, because each warrant is so cheap, you can buy a lot of them to give you a huge amount of leverage. 

**Example:** I buy XXXX’s warrant which is called XXXXW at a price of .25 cents each. The common stock (XXXX) is trading at 4.50 at the moment. If the common stock ever becomes more valuable than 11.50 plus the price I paid for each warrant (.25 cents), I am in the green as long as it happens within the next 5 years. So say XXXX’s common stock is 20.75 at the end of 5 years, I only pay 11.75 for each share. So assuming I exercised the warrant myself instead of selling it at its now much higher price to someone else, I make a profit of 9.00 for every 25 cent warrant I bought. If I bought a lot of them, it adds up incredibly fast. But just like an options contract, most people don’t exercise the warrant contracts themselves. They bought them early and will sell them way before the contract expires regardless if it’s in the money or out of the money because of the extra value that the remaining time gives it.

**The 2 Strategies That Have Worked for Me**

**Strategy** **1: Buy the Hidden Gems** 

A company has publicly traded warrants because they are brand new. The story that you will see over and over again is this. A SPAC (Special Purpose Acquisitions Company) finds a company they want to merge with. The SPAC gets hyped to the moon as people wait for the date when the SPAC merges with their bride to be. The merger date finally comes and the newly formed company begins to trade on its own ticker. The ticker is immediately decimated as the original investors leave as soon as they can to take advantage of the hype. Most ex-SPAC’s deserve this. Their balance sheets are uglier than a hairy ass and most will likely never make it even close to the 11.50 trading price. But this is not true for all. There are some discarded diamonds. 

If you have the patience to look at the first earnings report for each ex-SPAC that just fell out of the nest, you could find tickers with solid revenue and a long runway of growth in front of them for pennies. Multiply your gains by buying warrants aggressively on those companies instead of buying their common stock. If people catch on that your company is on a good trajectory, you could be selling that .25 cent warrant you just bought for upwards of 1.00 in a few months, maybe even 5.00 in a couple years. If you like to gamble you can even buy warrants on a ticker that hasn’t had its first earnings report as a new company (provided you love everything you’ve found out through your research). Odds are that sentiment has reached the bottom of the barrel if you catch the ex-SPAC in this period. In my experience, this works best when you look at the least-sexy ex-SPACs. If you bet on warrants for a meme EV SPAC, you might be slapping your forehead soon. Running through Marketwatch’s warrant index once a week and researching any new ones, might lead you to a 100 bagger before it’s on anyone’s radar. 

**Strategy 2: Tender Offer Arbitrage** 

When an ex-SPAC is aggressive about preventing dilution or really needs cash, they might do what’s called a tender offer on their warrants. This offer is almost always a great deal to the warrant holders. If it’s a cashless exchange, they will offer you a partial common stock for every warrant you turn into them. If the majority of warrant holders agree to the deal, you now get common shares at a steal and the company limits the effect of dilution. This is at the expense of the people that were holding commons since their shares will be worth a little less. Usually the news is enough to drop the commons significantly and shoot the warrants up. If it’s an overreaction, warrant holders get an even better deal since commons will likely return to their old baseline once the exchange happens and people realize it was unnecessarily beat down. For some reason, you can often find warrants trading at say .25 cents when you can trade them in for a partial common stock that’s worth .50 cents. It may be because people are afraid the warrant holders will vote no or they’re too lazy to understand the tender offer, but it gives you a great window to profit. 

**What to Avoid:** 

* Ex-SPACs usually have a very low float and are incredibly susceptible to both positive and negative swings due to news. Their warrants are even more volatile. You guys are no strangers to volatility but it’s not easy to day trade them because there is usually a large spread between bid and ask. 
* If you take away one thing from what I say, I want it to be this. Both SPACs and ex-SPACs are plagued with people ready to pump and dump. Trying to momentum trade a meme pump and dump in warrants usually doesn’t end well. When I first started doing this, I got burned every time I tried so be skeptical of any ticker you start hearing about often. 
* There’s no way around it. You have to go through the quarterly reports. At the very least, understand how to read their balance sheets. It might be the most valuable hour of youtube you spend in your life. Be careful of any ticker with a shitload of “Goodwill.” It’s almost always a placeholder. When bad news comes out, warrants take steep dives. If you find yourself holding bags but you feel your initial analysis was solid, just hold for a few months. Odds are you’ll be pissed you didn’t wait to see your warrants react to a positive catalyst. Meme warrants sometimes don’t come back at all though if they were hugely overvalued. 
* On the rare occasion that you strike gold and catch a warrant before others do, it might take some time for it to be discovered. It will be painful just watching it gather dust but the rewards of when it takes off are worth it. I’ve only been in this game for a year but I know some seasoned warrant veterans that have essentially become overnight millionaires from looking where no one else would.
*  Make sure you understand the terms of the warrants. Although the majority have a 5 year contract and are a 1 to 1 trade at a strike price of 11.50, not all of them are. Some warrants are weird with a 2:1 trade and require you to basically use 2 warrants to exercise.

This week I am looking at the options contracts that have been mentioned on the subreddits we track.  Specifically, I am looking at contracts expiring this Friday 12/18.    The data collected for this analysis was collected from 12/04 – 12/10.  For Friday’s expiration there are 448 contracts and 714 mentions of these contracts.  Quite an increase from last week which is pretty exciting.  Though, I mostly attribute this to improvements in the machine learning models we are using to identify stocks and contracts.  The most popular contracts this week are the PLTR 30 Call and the LAZR 30 Put.  

The goal here is to track what reddit is following and to see how reddit preforms.  There is this notion that retail investors often fail to beat the market. This is why financial advisors recommend that you buy into the major ETF’s such as SPY.  As historically there have been few people that manage to beat the major Index’s year over year.  My hypothesis going into this week is that I should bet against the trends on reddit as typically the retail investor is wrong.  

As of week 1, I would have profited $1710 betting against reddit [Last Weeks Recap](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditTickers/comments/kbcc6x/weekly_results_what_if_you_sold_the_most_popular/).  I will continue to track my progress each week. 

I just want to emphasize it does not matter if I am right or wrong.  More importantly this research is to identify if there are any trends worth following. 

Call Data

* Out of the 448 contracts 356 are calls (80% Long)  
* 70.8% of the calls are out of the money
* The out of the money Calls are an average of 23% out of the money. 
* The in the money calls are an average of 26% in the money. 

Put Data

* Out of 448 Contracts 92 are puts
* 67.4% of the puts are out of the money
* The out of the money puts are an average of 18.7% out of the money
* The in the money puts are an average of 22% in the money 

On both the call and put sides the out of the money contracts are an average of 20%+ out of the money.  I am not that surprised as there is a lot of yolo culture on reddit.  It is surprising to see the number of contracts that are out of the money in general.  Out of the 448 contracts only 134 are in the money as of last Friday’s close. 

The most popular calls that are in the money are: 

* PLTR 20, 22, 26 
* TSLA 600 
 

The most popular puts that are in the money are: 

* LAZR 30
* CRSR 35.  

The most popular calls that are out of the money are 

* PLTR 30, 32, 35 
* TSLA 630, 650, 700
* ARKG 100
* NIO 50 
* SPY 380

The most popular puts that are out of the money are:

* LAZR 25, 20
* SPY 350
* PLTR 25, 26
* SNOW 330

My hypothesis is that the majority of these contracts will be losers.  Based on the data I would be looking to sell the PLTR 32 and TSLA 630 calls and LAZR 20 / 25 Puts. I will update with the premium prices first thing tomorrow morning at market open._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Rite Aid: Bullish or Bearish? Rite Aid reports earnings this upcoming Thursday. It's a heavily shorted and hated on by most analysts.

However, I think they have potential for Thursday. Last report, they saw an 18% share price tank on blowout results, mainly because the company lowered guidance for FY21 dramatically and to a very wide range (-$0.67 to $0.09). The upcoming report is for Q321, so guidance could change if Rite Aid sees a solid beat on estimates, of course. I don't doubt that they will do well, they have pretty low estimates and great profit potential from increased flu-shot demand in most pharmacies.

However, there are numerous problems that could affect their forward FY21 and (potentially provided?) FY22 guidance. 1) Amazon is entering the prescription drugs space, which I'm sure you've heard already - this could be a major source of business disruption for Rite Aid. 2) Increased costs associated with management's RxEvolution strategy. Lots of brand transformation going on.

But yes, there are numerous tailwinds. Management is successfully cutting SG&A expenses and developing a great cost-cutting and transformation strategy in its RxEvolution goal. The new CEO is doing great. Lots of new people on the management team. Also, recent acquisition of Bartell Drugs may be accretive to business by early FY22.

You can see by the red dots that the TTM squeeze is on. It isn't hard to find the squeeze the hard part is picking the direction. We can see long term trend was up and then it took a small dive and his now slowly trending up as the bands compress.

Things I Like:

Band is compressing really tight

100 market is like a magnet (both ways)

Short term trend is up.

Things I don't like:

TTM still positive. I like to see this turn negative but stay weak. Then the move is confirmed.

This is likely a day or two away but I'm already in on a call.

Cut this trade lose for a small loss if it breaks Bottom bollinger band support. If it bounces off it I would back the truck up because its likely to move the next day.

#Big Capital, Big Crime, and Rivers of Blood

This section will attempt to provide some historical context on the history of Big Capital with a particular focus on the inextricable links between intelligence agencies (mainly the Central Intelligence Agency and its predecessor, the Office of Strategic Services) and Wall Street, starting around the time of World War II. It will lean heavily on the work of Michael S. Judge, whose podcast [Death is Just Around the Corner](https://www.patreon.com/deathcorner/) has become an integral part of my understanding of the nature of American imperialism, which has been largely scrubbed from the history books. It will also draw from excellent books including but not limited to Vincent Bevins' [The Jakarta Method](https://www.publicaffairsbooks.com/titles/vincent-bevins/the-jakarta-method/9781541724013/) and Stephen Kinzer's [The Brothers](https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250053121) and [Poisoner in Chief](https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250140432). In the interest of accessibility, I will be supplying Wikipedia articles for further reading, but with the caveat that [Wikipedia itself cowtows to the American imperial project](https://thegrayzone.com/2020/06/10/wikipedia-formally-censors-the-grayzone-as-regime-change-advocates-monopolize-editing/) and **should not be taken as an authoritative account of history.**

I think the best place to start this story is with Allen Dulles, the longest serving director of the CIA, and his brother John Foster Dulles, who was Dwight Eisenhower's Secretary of State. Before joining the federal government, the Dulles brothers worked for [United Fruit Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Fruit_Company), which is now known as Chiquita Brands International (yes, the 🍌 company), where John served as legal counsel and Allen was on the board of directors. The United Fruit Company was a key driver of the CIA-led [1954 Guatemalan coup that ousted the democratically elected Jacobo Arbenz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1954_Guatemalan_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat) and replaced him with the dictator Carlos Castillo Armas, which will be a recurring theme in this missive. Put a pin in this for now, because we have to backtrack a little further first.

It is critical to understand that the CIA and the agencies that came before it are deeply rooted in the boy's club of Wall Street from the years between World War I and World War II, and that pipeline catapulted people like [Prescott Bush](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prescott_Bush) (father of George H.W. Bush and grandfather of George W. Bush) to the highest levels of the American government. Most of these roaches skittered out of investment banks like [Brown Brothers Harriman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_Brothers_Harriman_%26_Co.) or law firms like [Sullivan & Cromwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sullivan_%26_Cromwell), both institutions that still stand to this day.

Prescott Bush and the Dulles brothers were up to some real sketchy shit before, during, and after WWII, [having business ties to German industrialists that helped finance Hitler's rise to power and helping Nazis launder money and transport looted art and valuables through European banks](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/sep/25/usa.secondworldwar). Supreme Court Justice Arthur Goldberg even went so far to say that ["The Dulles brothers were traitors."](http://libcom.org/library/making-killing-christian-dewar) Prescott and the Dulles brothers were probably not literally card-carrying Nazis, but the model of fusing big business and central government, which the CIA was based on and adheres to up to this very day, [**is explicitly fascist when going off of the dictionary definition of the word**](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/fascism) (read: not using it as a proxy for "person I disagree with politically" as it's so often used today). Did you know that the CIA has an active venture capital operation called [In-Q-Tel](https://www.iqt.org/) and that Palantir's only early investor besides Peter Thiel was [one and the same](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/10/21/magazine/palantir-alex-karp.html)? Now you do.

In the last days and immediate aftermath of WWII, the intelligence agencies spearheaded an effort by the US government called [Operation Paperclip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Paperclip), which was designed to save Nazi and Japanese scientists from the gallows and put them to work developing weapons programs in the US. [Wernher von Braun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wernher_von_Braun), chief architect of the Saturn V 🚀 that sent Apollo to the 🌑? Operation Paperclip. [Shiro Ishii](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shir%C5%8D_Ishii), a man who was loading grenades full of plague bacteria and sewing babies together and shit in Manchukuo (Japanese-occupied China)? Operation Paperclip.

At this point in the story, WWII is over and the USSR has become the Big Bad Mans of the time period from 1945 to 1991 that we collectively refer to as the Cold War. Unfortunately, the Cold War was not actually very cold, and instead took the shape of a seemingly endless series of proxy wars and regime change operations led by Western intelligence agencies attempting, with various degrees of success, to overthrow democratically elected leftists and appoint authoritarian leaders with the backing of weapons and money from the CIA. This is not an exhaustive list, but includes examples like the [1953 Iranian coup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1953_Iranian_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat) that overthrew Mohammad Mosaddegh and replaced him with Shah Pahlavi, the aforementioned 1954 Guatemalan coup, the [mass killings in Indonesia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesian_mass_killings_of_1965%E2%80%9366) that ultimately resulted in the removal of Sukarno and a 31 year military junta under Suharto, the [1973 Chilean coup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1973_Chilean_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat) that brought Augusto Pinochet to power, and both the [Korean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_War) and [Vietnam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War) Wars, in which the greatest military in the world was epically pwned by a bunch of starving jungle fighters using slingshots and AK-47s.

The underlying reason for a lot of this carnage, besides the stated goal of beating back the spectre of communism or whatever the fuck? Resources. Iran had oil, Chile had nationalized the copper mines that Big Capital needed to fuel the electronics boom, and both the [Golden Triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Triangle_\(Southeast_Asia\)) and [Golden Crescent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Crescent) were fertile ground for growing opium, which was used to make the heroin the CIA trafficked all over the world and sold to buy weapons that they then gave to the dictators they propped up, sometimes [using the bodies of dead soldiers as mules](https://www.nytimes.com/1972/12/17/archives/drug-feared-sent-in-bodies-of-gis-court-told-that-smugglers-used.html). 

Does any of this sound familiar and related to the current day? How about the overthrow of [Evo Morales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Bolivian_protests) in Bolivia, which was applauded by [Elon Musk](https://imgur.com/XCsXNTJ), who wants cheap access to their copper mines so he can make batteries for his shitty cars? How about the Forever War in the Middle East, which has effectively turned [Afghanistan into a narco-state?](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/jan/09/how-the-heroin-trade-explains-the-us-uk-failure-in-afghanistan) How about the endless revolving door between the Pentagon, defense contractors, and the rest of the federal government, as exemplified most recently by the nomination of [Raytheon board member General Lloyd Austin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lloyd_Austin) to be Joe Biden's Secretary of Defense? That's right, you blue-pilled goldfish, the Democrats are not your friends either.

#The Stripe and PSTH Angles

Alright, enough psychic assault for the moment. Let's talk about Stripe for a bit. As stated previously, Stripe is building the infrastructure that the internet economy runs on. The Collison brothers, those cheeky little leprechauns, seem like they're wired pretty differently than most of the money grubbing bug people that inhabit Silicon Valley. [Take this clip of co-founder and CEO Patrick Collison](https://youtu.be/knXY3Rwtfww?t=1495) talking about the nature of motivation (listen through to ~27:20 at least). [Or this one of co-founder and president John Collison](https://youtu.be/N_W62v3RYwc?t=239) talking about the need to support small businesses who have been reamed by the pandemic and build Stripe bigger and better as a service to the small fish in the ocean (listen through to the end on this one).

Bill Ackman is a signatory on the [Giving Pledge](https://givingpledge.org/Pledger.aspx?id=157), and as discussed in the previous post, is also not your typical Wall Street swamp monster. He remarried last year and has a kid that's a little over a year old by this point. He deeply understands that the finance game is rigged against the little guys, that Big Capital has wrapped its disgusting slimy tentacles all over the world, and is choking more life out of it every single day. Could it be that he wants to do whatever he can to stop the world his kid will grow up in from devolving further into some kind of [Mad Max](https://imgur.com/HTpAmLG) scenario?

[The order of operations for how PSTH is structured is flipped on its head](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/22/bill-ackman-and-tontine-holdings-rewrite-the-terms-for-spacs.html) from the way previous SPACs have been run by institutions like Goldman Sachs (remember, we hate them) with regard to sponsor compensation. Pershing Square isn't taking a thing until the investors in the SPAC see a 20% return, whereas most SPACs include clauses allowing the sponsors to snatch cheap warrants with their grubby little hands because they are run by unapologetic money pigs.

#An Aside About CЯyptocurrency

I, like most of you, am way too stupid to understand how the fuck cЯypto actually works on a fundamental level, but I think it's pretty clear that the reason it has value at all is as a hedge against total economic societal collapse like we've been seeing most recently in places like Venezuela, which underwent inflation to the tune of nearly [***54 million percent***](https://venezuelaaldia.com/2019/05/28/banco-central-venezuela-hiperinflacion-2016/) between 2016 and 2019. Hey, what the fuck is that Juan Guaido guy up to? Oh, [he's a CIA sock puppet](https://thegrayzone.com/2019/01/29/the-making-of-juan-guaido-how-the-us-regime-change-laboratory-created-venezuelas-coup-leader/).

It is interesting to note that Stripe used to support cЯypto but eliminated that functionality, at least directly, back in [2018](https://imgur.com/crnp9iJ). Patrick Collison used to talk about cЯypto frequently and would say things like [this](https://imgur.com/OSbi8uz) (take note of the date) but has been largely silent on the issue for years. I think it's possible that he and his brother have come around to thinking that while cЯypto is a heady big brain idea, it's too inaccessible for dummies like you and me, who just want to buy a cup of coffee without paying $20 in transaction fees. They could be trying to build a vanguard that would make such a thing unnecessary for a functioning society, a system that continues to run on dollars, euros, yen, and yuan. 

That, and the original idea for cЯypto came from [another part of the bowels of the Deep State, the NSA](http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/classes/6.805/articles/money/nsamint/nsamint.htm). You know, that thing Edward Snowden revealed as spying on everyone all the time with the support of [the tech giants](https://imgur.com/buIPP1S), but we're mostly all cool with because hey, cat videos and free porn!

I do have some suspicions about Snowden, being a former CIA contractor and all, and his insistence that privacy-minded folks use Tor, which is and always has been a [project of the Department of Defense and intelligence agencies](https://www.wired.com/story/cia-sets-up-shop-on-tor/). If you, like me, used cЯypto to buy drugs on the dark net back in the heady days of 2015 when they were basically crime bucks, you're also probably on a watchlist somewhere at Langley.

#Conclusion

If you've reached this point without your eyes rolling back in your head and starting to drool, I sincerely applaud you 👏👏👏. I hope that you've learned something new and are now thinking about what bigger brains than you and I have, like those of Bill Ackman and the Collisons, could be trying to put out there in the world, if a PSTH + Stripe union is truly in the cards.

I do find it quite interesting to look at the list of [Restricted Businesses](https://stripe.com/restricted-businesses) at Stripe. It includes a lot of things that Ackman has historically and more recently placed in his sights as the targets of his wrath, like multi-level marketing schemes and pseudopharmaceuticals (Herbalife) and pornography (Pornhub versus the credit card companies). There's also things you can extrapolate outward from if you want to get real wacky and use looser definitions, like "gambling" and "get rich quick schemes" (i.e. Robinhood).

Thank you for reading my brain ejaculation, and always remember: Big Brother is watching you.


**TLDR: Reining in the types of financial crime that have created this fucked up world we're all stuck in is imperative to building a future that is better and more equitable for people all around the world, not just in the United States. A merger of Stripe with PSTH could represent a gigantic leap forward for driving a sword into the heart of the beast of Big Capital. You could get in now instead of the alternative that the traditional IPO process provides, where the big institutions get the first crack at everything and leave table scraps for the rest of us to fight over.

#positions or ban

since I now have little piggies oinking away at me about positions, here you go. [Roth IRA](https://imgur.com/MDO1OJU) and [Tastyworks](https://imgur.com/glDGYRs). As stated in the first post, I intend to liquidate a large chunk of my mutual fund holdings in the IRA when the year end dividend goes out in a couple weeks and put that money into more PSTH shares._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Tak Alright so takeda is going to produce the NVX‑CoV2373 vaccine made by novavax in Japan. Tak is backed by mhlw Japanese cdc to do this. NVX‑CoV2373 phase 3 trials in the uk are about to end. Phase 3 in US are about to start. Supposedly this vaccine shits on Pfizer’s and moderna’s and doesn’t require -9000 temps. 


Takeda will have the capacity to produce 250 million doses in Japan a year = billions of tendies.

Yeah, them. Their current share price is $8.69 and its 52-week high is $10.69.
Now if those numbers aren’t enough for you to YOLO all your life savings in otm calls, then I have more numbers for you:
Their average sales growth over the past 3 years is 32%
Their sales for 2020 make up almost 22% of their market cap, which is way greater than the 10% benchmark for tech companies and game developers.
Needless to say these guys are PROFITABLE too..

The mobile game industry is expected to grow at a CAGR of 1.8% which is not super impressive but these guys are going to dominate that market as they have been acquiring major competitors all year (Peak, Rollic, etc).
