 Mastercard to open up network to select cryptocurrencies **(Reuters) - Mastercard Inc** said on Wednesday it was planning to offer support for some cryptocurrencies on its network this year, joining a string of big-ticket firms that have pledged similar support.

The credit-card giant’s announcement comes days after Elon Musk’s Tesla Inc revealed it had purchased $1.5 billion of bitcoin and would soon accept it as a form of payment.

Asset manager BlackRock Inc and payments companies Square and PayPal have also recently backed cryptocurrencies.

Mastercard already offers customers cards that allow people to transact using their cryptocurrencies, although without going through its network.

"Doing this work will create a lot more possibilities for shoppers and merchants, allowing them to transact in an entirely new form of payment. This change may open merchants up to new customers who are already flocking to digital assets," Mastercard said.

Mastercard specified that not all cryptocurrencies will be supported on its network, adding that many of the hundreds of digital assets in circulation still need to tighten their compliance measures.

Many cryptocurrencies have struggled to win the trust of mainstream investors and the general public due to their speculative nature and potential for money laundering.

What do you think about those 2 new stock's;_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Discussion on "averaging down" being a myth (4th time trying to post this lol)

I see a lot of people use the term "averaging down" to try to lower their cost basis on a certain stock,  but in my opinion I don't think "averaging down" is actually a thing.

For example, say you invested $300 on 1 share of a certain stock X at its   peak, and  now the stock has dropped to $50 and you buy another share,   so now  you've "averaged down" your cost basis to $175. But really it   doesn't change the fact that you bought 1 share of stock X for $300.   That action is irreversible.

People who average  down hope that stock X can rebound to say $200, which is   higher than their current cost basis of $175, so technically you've   gained $25 per share, but in reality, you lost $100 on the $300 buy and   made $150 on the $50 buy.

So really the key decision of investment is all about the present, as in   this case: should I put $50 on stock X because I expect it to quadruple   to $200, or can I find another stock Y that I think will grow better   than that, to say, $300? Instead of thinking about the past irrevocable   buy they made at $300 and trying to think in terms of averaging down  the  cost basis. In fact, if they find that stock Y they feel will grow   better than stock X, the optimal decision would  actually be to sell   their formerly $300-now $50 share of stock X and put it into stock Y.

Tldr: when thinking about cutting losses, it's really about comparing rebound   potential of your declining stock vs potential growth of a promising stock._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Shaq, Lebron James, & former TikTok CEOs SPAC announce $3B merger with Beachbody Some people involved with this (which is honestly a big part of why I'm so excited):

* Shaq
* Kevin Mayer, TikTok's former CEO,
* Lebron James
* Arnold Schwarzenegger
* Tom Staggs, former Disney CFO & COO

The announcement just came out. [Full version](https://on.wsj.com/2Nhy8de).

Here are the **highlights**:

"Fitness-and-nutrition business the Beachbody Company Group LLC plans to merge with a blank-check company affiliated with former TikTok Chief Executive Kevin Mayer in a deal that values the combined company at nearly $3 billion."

As part of the deal, Myx Fitness LLC, an at-home connected cycling provider, will become part of The Beachbody Company.

Beachbody is expected to generate more than $1.1 billion of revenue this year.

"Beachbody said it plans to use the capital to expand its sales and digital marketing efforts and to enter new geographies"

Other awesome things about FRX:

* Lebron James and Arnold Schwarzenegger are involved (to what extent, I'm not sure but Beachbody [owns the majority stake in their shared company Ladder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beachbody_Company#Divisions))
* The company [also owns P90X](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beachbody_Company#History)

**My Due Diligence:**

The company is diversified between 3 separate companies, each with complementary but different offerings. The fitness offering, I think, pairs really well with their roster on the team which (as covered above) is highly experienced in sports and media.

Peloton is due for a competitor. It's a great platform but its not the solution EVERYONE needs. MYX Fitness' products offer added choice to a marketplace that is foaming at the mouth for more options.

The company has been around for over 20 years which is just a nice reassurance

Because of how the deal is structured, it appears the company will now be, more than ever, able to expand via acquisitions (they actually mention this in the article) and a HEAVY digital marketing spend.

**Ticker:** FRX (for now)

I’ve been sending emails to customer support for days now without response. Right after some of my shares got transferred to the other brokerage, RH said I had an account deficit, which is impossible because I hasn’t bought any stock with Robinhood recently.

I see the deal as very likely to happen. The conversion rate for Aphria shares into Tilray shares is 0.8381 which means for every Aphria share you own you get .8381 shares of Tilray. Right now, Tilray is trading around $63 per share. This means that theoretically Aphria should be worth around $52 at the close of the deal. Currently Aphria is trading at a 50% discount. Is the market assuming the deal won’t go through. Is Tilray only going up because of a short squeeze. Seems like a good opportunity for a pair trade at this crazy discount.

I've been investing for a couple years. Most of my stock picks have been large cap companies, lots of tech and consumer products. I follow trends, buy the dip, yadda yadda.

About a year ago I started putting extra money into ETFs. For those, I have focused on tech heavy funds, clean energy, next gen stuff- all Vanguard or low cost funds. Now that my portfolio is split evenly between individual stocks and ETFs, I've noticed a surprising trend:

My ETFs beat my stock picks almost every day. Today is a great example- in a mixed market, my individual stocks are (collectively) down -$195, but my ETFs are (collectively) up $110. And it is like this fairly consistently. On a good day for the markets as a whole, my ETFs are always beating my stock picks. Sure, there are times I have an individual stock that might pop and outperform my ETFs, but more regularly, my collective stock picks rarely outperform my collection of ETF picks.

I guess I am just saying that I am done trying to pick the next winning stock, spending my valuable time pouring over charts and digging through the news for rumors. I am liquidating my individual stocks and dumping it all back into my ETF picks at the next market dip.

[edit] SO MANY PEOPLE asking what my ETF picks are. I am not a financial expert, so I don't claim that these are the best, but I have: VGT QQQJ VOO SCHA ARKK and VBIX (which is a mutual fund, not an ETF).

https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/10/fed-chair-powell-citing-bleak-jobs-picture-says-policy-will-need-to-stay-patiently-accommodative.html

> The real unemployment rate in the U.S. is closer to 10 percent, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said Wednesday, after misclassification errors are factored in to the official government figure. The current unemployment rate, as reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics last week, is 6.3 percent.
> 
> "We are still very far from a strong labor market whose benefits are broadly shared," Powell said, in a virtual speech for the Economic Club of New York on the state of the labor market. "The pandemic has led to the largest 12-month decline in labor force participation since at least 1948," he said.
> 
> While the national unemployment rate has fallen from its March peak of 14.8 percent, it is still much higher than its pre-pandemic level. The unemployment rate in February 2020, before the coronavirus took hold of the economy, was just 3.5 percent, the lowest level in almost 50 years.

> “Given the number of people who have lost their jobs and the likelihood that some will struggle to find work in the post-pandemic economy, achieving and sustaining maximum employment will require more than supportive monetary policy,” Powell said, stressing the importance of low interest rates. “It will require a society-wide commitment,” he added.

I did my taxes a week ago, thinking it'd be good to it done with since I had some time. I paid a lot in taxes this year since I invested some money when the market was down, figuring the shutdown would end at some point. Seeing how the market rose back so quickly, I sold, thinking we were in a bubble. We may still be, but that isn't the main point of me writing this.

The point of it is that the stimulus bill might have an income cap of $75k. Normally, my salary is below the cap that might pass. However, by selling my investments, I made enough money to the point where I passed the $75k mark.

Yes, this income cap might not be in the final law, but if it is you should be sure to either A) wait to file if your 2020 income is higher than your past income or B) file quickly if your 2020 income is less than your 2019 income.

Also, I know I'm fortunate that I made more money this year, but this is an investing subreddit. Helping people get more money is part of the point of investing. I'm sure an extra $1400 would help a lot of people. I don't have a six figure salary, I just try to be smart with my money and posted this in part to help other people do the same._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Upland Software DD - Earnings Play I don't know if this is the right subreddit for this, or if I should post it under r/smallstreetbets, but I wanted to share some due diligence I've done on what I consider to be an undervalued company: Upland Software.

I think by normal Wallstreet metrics this company is extremely undervalued. My current position is 6 March contracts and 50 shares worth 30% of my portfolio (I'm not a wealthy man). 

First, this company has beat expected earnings [NINE consecutive times](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/UPLD/earnings/). Their earnings are coming up in late February and the implied volatility is currently extremely low, so the premium on options are cheap cheap cheap. And while I don't normally like to buy options before earnings, I think this is far enough out where the theta gang won't completely mess with my play. Second, they're a subscription based company so their revenue never really dips, it has only grown over the past three years (how often do you change insurance companies, or cancel your Netflix, or change internet providers, or hospitals leave EPIC?) Third, their free cash flow was upwards of $233 million in September for their last earnings, while their Price/Book ratio is currently hovering around 5.0. To put that P/B ratio into perspective, one of their main competitors, Smartsheet Inc. (SMAR) is currently hovering around 17.5. 

Furthermore, [Wallstreet analysts have them with a consensus buy rating with a fair market value averaging at $53.50/share even though they're currently being traded at $49/share](https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/nasdaq-upld-insider-buying-and-selling-2021-01/). So when analysts publish their expected EPS for Q4, I firmly believe this has not been factored into their price yet, since $50/share is nearly identical to where they were after their Q3 earnings report of 0.55EPS, which earned them the increase price target by analysts, and I expect EPS to **improve** considering that was the first quarter after they [sold 3.5Million shares to generate $119 million in cash](https://www.statesman.com/story/business/2021/01/20/austins-upland-software-keeps-growing-acquires-second-street-media/4232372001/). And they've seen revenue improvement to the tune of $11M, $2M, $3M, $3M over their last four quarters, while seeing operating costs continually decrease.

Now back to free cash flow. With that money, UPLD has decided to acquire [Second Street](https://www.rbr.com/second-street-gets-purchased-its-an-upland-move/) for $25Million, which they expect to generate $9Million recurring revenue annually for them. Even at $25M that barely puts a dent into their FCF and won't be reflected until Q1 earnings, so their Q4 FCF will be fine, along with decreased operational expenses and forwarding losses against taxes. 

Their previous earnings calls did lend us some clues as to what to expect for Q4 as well:

>In Q3, we had 35% growth in total revenue. We had 21% adjusted EBITDA growth. Now our EBITDA growth was lower than our revenue growth due to our ongoing sales and marketing investments and also a temporary uptick in CXM messaging costs based on the high election year volumes.  
>  
>Q3 cash flow was $18.5 million. We only had $3.6 million of acquisition expense in the quarter, and we had a little over $3 million of net positive working capital changes. And from this point forward, we're focused on generating material GAAP operating cash flow and free cash flow, even after acquisition expenses, even after we turn the acquisition program back on. We completed in the third quarter a transformational equity raise. And we are now capitalized well enough to be able to grow double digits through a combination of organic growth and acquisitions for a very long time and are no longer dependent on the equity capital markets due to our free cash flow generation.  
>  
>Our Q3 organic growth in reported recurring revenues came in at 14%. Now this recent acceleration in organic growth is all being driven by that bump in election year CXM usage by political campaigns and other advocacy organizations. And that usage has, to date, more than offset any COVID-related bookings and churn impact. And we see continued strengths in organic growth as we move into Q4, but we don't view this as any kind of a new normal for organic growth. Some of this election year usage bump will continue in 2021 as political campaign spending shifts to issue advocacy spending. But we can't say exactly how much, so we're going to maintain a conservative organic growth outlook for 2021.

Organic growth was excellent at 14% and their FCF gives them equity freedom, but the interesting part to me was the 21% "inorganic" growth due to political campaigns, which suggests that Q4 should also see an inorganic bump to revenue since Q3 was from June-September and Q4 includes October-December which is peak campaigning, followed by the Georgia runoff which lasted until January. They also specifically mentioned advocacy spending into early 2021. 

Finally, they're a small market cap at $1.5B, with a float of only 25.33M, of which [97.56% (24.71M) are owned by institutions or insiders, despite January's new short data suggesting that \~9% (2.22M) shares are shorted](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/upld/short-interest) according to NASDAQ. **\*Note, I think some of this data might be dated as MarketBeat has institutional holdings at 77.64%, which would change the total to \~94% shares owned\*** 

Let me be clear, I am not suggesting this play to cause a short squeeze, but I do find it interesting that there is supposedly only \~600,000-1.5M shares available unless you're buying from an institution, which is actually reflected in their average daily trading volume of <300,000. For those that want to know who owns how many shares: [here you go](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/UPLD/institutional-ownership/). I also want to caution that if this play becomes popular, because there are limited available shares that this stock could become volatile very quickly, so proceed with caution. 

Indications my short term growth thesis may be **incorrect**: poor ROA, ROE, ROI historical performance, and consistent insider selling over the last two months (albeit incredibly small volumes). 

TL:DR - Bullish short term, bullish long term. Consistent growth due to subscription based services.

I am not a financial advisor, I just like this stock and see short term/long term value in it, so I've decided to make a play on it personally.  If any gurus out there see something either bearish or bullish that I've missed, I'll edit accordingly._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Young and ready for aggressive investing... but nervous about bullish market I started a company a few years ago that has done really well - and I haven't done anything with my personal cash yet.  My focus has always been on re-investing into the company, but now that i'm past the start-up phase, my student loans are completed, I'm maxing out my 401k, and have a healthy low-interest mortgage - its probably time to take some calculated risk and invest in some aggressive stock opportunities.  


In the little reading that I've been doing over the past couple weeks, my interest is in a spread of ETFs - and all the ARK madness really good - but obviously past success does not indicate future potential here.... and if history has taught us anything, I imagine those stocks will hit a bubble at some point.  


So -- if you were me, and had \~$100k to invest in some shortish term aggressive stock --- would you risk it in a couple ARKs?  My 401k is really what matters for retirement, and my company is stable and will generate healthy revenue --- so I'm comfortable with an aggressive risk..... just feels like poor decision making to buy into something so big when it's at its peak.  


Thoughts?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ ThinkOrSwim thinkBack data accuracy I was trying to backtest a LEAP strategy to see the outcome in a worst-case scenario. Basically, I tested what happens if you buy an ATM call option dated 1 year out, and then the market goes down--is 1y enough to recover from that loss? 

Using ToS's thinkBack backtesting tool, I bought that ATM call option on $SPY dated for 1y out, with purchase date on Feb 19, 2020 (peak before the market crash to test the worst case scenario). Predictably, the P/L graph was negative during the market crash, but the graph slowly recovered and was a few thousand in the green after about half a year, confirming my idea that simply holding the option may often be enough to offset the loss. This was also true if you bought an ATM call at the dip (best case scenario), this time with a profit of over 10k per contract if you held til today--I was honestly expecting IV crush with the falling VIX to cancel any gains you'd get, so this surprised me.

My question is, how accurate are these numbers? I know ToS warns that this historical data doesn't necessarily translate to future performance. But my question is, is this is actual value of the call option at that point in time? Or is this simply what ToS has calculated that it may be worth based on the greeks at the time of purchase? 

I ask because a large portion of the value of the option in a 1y option is coming from gamma, which of course was not constant during the crash. So is it safe to assume that the values ToS uses were based on the *actual* greeks for the option *at each point in time*, or simply what they calculated based on the initial greeks at the time of purchase?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Random Facts for the Automated VTI Investor (including the best day of week to invest) So this originally started with my interest in finding out 'what day of the week was best to auto-invest in my M1 account'. Using Yahoo Finance historical data for VTI over the past 5 years, I ended up answering this question plus diving deeper to make a few other random observations. Here is what I found:

* **What day of the week is best to buy VTI for dips?**
   * **Thursday**, hands down
   * Data for average delta of opening vs previous trading day close:
      * Mon: +0.056016
      * Tues: +0.228716
      * Wed: +0.114864
      * Thurs: -0.05267
      * Fri: +0.071502
* **Does the day of the week matter over a long period of time?**
   * Basically **no** \-- but if you're going to pick a day for auto-investing and want to feel like you're getting a 'deal' by buying on dips then you should pick Thurs morning
   * I setup my spreadsheet to show the total gains of auto-investing $100/week on a given day. I did not factor in closed trading days + that M1 Finance auto-invest on the next open trading day.  So certain days (Mondays particularly) had significantly less buys than Tues/Wed.
   * Data for average portfolio size of auto-investing in VTI:
      * Mon: 236 buys, cost-basis $23.6k, current value $35.7k, gain 51.22%
      * Tues: 257 buys, cost-basis $25.7k, current value $38.9k, gain 51.33%
      * Wed: 257 buys, cost-basis $25.7k, current value $39.0k, gain 51.96%
      * Thurs: 255 buys, cost-basis $25.5k, current value $38.7k, gain 51.93%
      * Fri: 253 buys, cost-basis $25.3k, current value $38.4k, gain +51.83%
* **What day of the week saw best overall gains?**
   * Still **Tuesdays**
   * Data for average delta of closing vs previous trading day close:
      * Mon: +0.076398
      * Tues: +0.160039
      * Wed: +0.13786
      * Thurs: +0.00851
      * Fri: +0.061344
   * If you compare this data vs the data from bullet #1, we see a few interesting facts:
      * Mon, Wed, and Thurs will close higher than opening
      * Tues and Fri we see some profit taking and close slightly lower than opening
* **What would happen if you just invested the $25.7k from bullet #2 in lump sum at the beginning of the 5 year period?**
   * Value of your VTI portfolio would be about **$60.5k** right now (or about 55% more)
* **Lastly... What would happen if you invested in yearly lump sums at the 'worst possible day of the year' (simulating the most unlucky investor ever)?**
   * I divided the $25.7k into 5 parts and invested $5140 on the worst day of 2016, 17, 18, 19 and 20. The choices of 'worst day' was completely subjective based on eye balling charts when VTI would dip over subsequent days/weeks.
   * Dates chosen:
      * 2016 - June 8
      * 2017 - March 1
      * 2018 - Sept 20
      * 2019 - May 3
      * 2020 - Feb 10
   * Final account value was **$38.6k**, or roughly the same as weekly auto-investing $100.

So I believe that maybe the market rally we saw coming last year into this one was about higher earnings despite COVID, and with that theory realized we might see either a sideways push or a correction in the near future. I am just preparing for this by keeping 10% of my account in cash to snatch some stocks in case of a pullback, and of course 90% I will remain invested because despite my own outlook the market may continue its rally higher due to lower rates and dovish fed stance. I will also keep dividends in cash to maximize reserves and increase opportunity. 
Once again, would appreciate seeing other people’s views to avoid tunnel vision on my end._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ AMZN emerging businesses potential vs retail/AWS While I realize that AMZN did incredibly well from start to finish in 2020 I also am aware that stock price often reflects future growth and potential. With that said, it feels as though in Amazon’s case most articles examining their valuation is based solely on the retail site and AWS. Sure, those account for the majority of income today, but they’re investing heavily in markets with incredibly high caps and have a very good chance of being major players due to their size, lobbying ability, and track record. Ie) Amazon Health Care, Zoox (autonomous taxi), Amazon Fresh (brick & mortar grocery), just to name a few. And, with everyone one of these business they cross-sell their others. So, my question is, how much do you consider these other businesses and their potential when buying AMZN vs strictly analyzing their retail/AWS?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Nasdaq, NYSE Sue SEC over planned overhaul of public data feeds source: [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-sec-lawsuit-nyse-nasdaq-idUSKBN2AA09P](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-sec-lawsuit-nyse-nasdaq-idUSKBN2AA09P)

This article is short and doesn't elaborate much on what the effects of giving public access to supply and demand data are. Sueing the SEC seems like another way to stifle access to information for retail investors disguised as a means to protect them.

I have a lot of bias right now against institutional entities and I'm interested in what people have to say about this and whether or not this is more sensational news for clicks. I couldn't find a source with specifics about what the SECs overhaul would look like so I'm torn on how I feel about this.

Edit: For those seeking further context, look through some of the great discussions in the comments!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Investment ideas on "Transhumanism" I'm looking to allocate part of my portfolio in companies that could be the future of "Transhumanism".  
When thinking about this concept I naturally tend to think about "Neuralink" which had been placed under the spotlight thanks to our friend Elon but I'm sure there is a lot of other promising companies (and available on the stock market) working on these concepts.

I'm not an expert at all but I guess "Transhumanism" translates into multiple fields:  
\- Robotic  
\- Medicine  
\- Bio-tech  
\- AI

What companies do you know are working in these fields today?  
What are the big actors?   
What could be the smaller but promising companies?  


Thanks!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Why I believe $OPRA is overseen by investors Opera is known by many as the default browser on non-apple smartphones in 2012.

What is overlooked is that Opera is more than just a browser. The company has been bought by a consortium of investors lead by Zhou Yahui.

&#x200B;

Half of existing products have been launched in the last years and new initiatives are in the pipeline:

* [Opera desktop browser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opera_(web_browser)) (Windows, MacOS, Linux)
* [Opera browser for Android](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opera_Mobile)
* [Opera GX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opera_GX) : Opera’s gaming browser, released in June 2019. The browser allows users to customize how much RAM, CPU, and network bandwidth it uses, and reached 7 million monthly active users.
* [Opera Mini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opera_Mini): originally released in 2005, version 50 of the browser was released in May 2020.[\[54\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opera_(company)#cite_note-:1-55) The redesign included a new UI, an improved data-saving mode, and a built-in file sharing service.
* Opera News: released in 2018, a news app with an AI-engine In 2020, Opera announced that its Opera News service had more than 200 million monthly active users.
* Opera Touch: a mobile browser released in 2018, available for Android and iOS
* OPay: a fintech startup incubated by Opera, it is a mobile-based money platform in Nigeria released in 2018.
* Opera Ads: advertising platform which integrates into all of Opera’s products released in May 2019.
* Nanobank: Microlending services which is partly owned by Opera

&#x200B;

New Initiatives:

* Pocosys and Fjord Bank acquisition to push "Buy now Pay later" services in Europe
* Acquisitoin of YOYO games which will generate synergies and a new market with the Opera GX browser.
* [Olist.ng](https://Olist.ng)

&#x200B;

The pace of  product launches is accelerating and with Opera News and the Opera Browser customer aqcuisition costs are considerably low. Downsides seem limited as Opera is profitable and growing its customer base steadilty.

this is no financial advice._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ One Planet for us all investment discussion Hi guys,

The announcement last week that Bezos is going to step down and focus on the Bezos Earth Fund got me motivated about environmental/positive stocks that I can invest in. Now for a bit of background I am a Brazilian carnivore that loves a rodizio (look it up if you've never heard of it) but over the past few years I have tried to slowly reduce my carbon footprint by lowering the amount of meat I eat to only 3-4 days a week with the rest of the week having meat alternatives. This is mainly driven by my partner who is a vegetarian thanks to the countless documentaries showing the horrendous conditions animals are kept in (yes America, I am looking at you) and the carbon footprint impact it has on our planet (David Attenborough documentary **One Planet** if you want to see a LEGENDS take on it). At the end of 2020 I bought some shares in **Beyond Meat** which was both a financial and environmental decision based on the expected increase in demand due to people doing Veganuary. On the 6th of Jan it was downgraded to Overweight by Piper Sandler causing it to crash 9% in a day. I find this very convenient seeing as only 6 days later the stock almost doubled in price following the Taco Bell partnership news. Now the sceptic in me feels that was placed news in order to buy at a lower price following a tip off about the deal. I will never really know due to the rigged game we are playing but that is how I feel (note this is only my opinion and not targeting Piper here but someone in the know surely made a fortune on this pump down and up).

Now comes my question. I just feel like a lot of the best companies that are up and coming are only available to VCs and private investors (Lewis Hamilton, Di Caprio to name a couple) which leaves us behind on getting in. So what stocks do you guys think has both financial and environmental potential over the next few years? From my side a couple of companies I would love to invest in are **Impossible Foods** and **Moving Mountains** but neither of them are available to invest in by us retail investors (they are available to buy though so if you get a chance to try them out). Another company I invested in that is doing the part for the environment is **Brewdog PLC** who I believe has bucked the trend by not trying to cash out by selling to the Big Guys, as is usually the fate of most brewers around the world. They did this by creating **EquityForPunks** which allows us beer drinkers to own a share of the company (I'd share a referral link but don't want this to be advertising in any way) . They have managed to raise over £100M through this and part of their latest fund raising was to become **carbon negative** for the entire life of the company (look up **Brewdog for Tomorrow)**. That is right guys they looked back at their total footprint and have now managed to become one of the first companies who is carbon negative (I don't know who but I'm sure others came first) by a range of actions including buying 2,000+ acres of land to plan trees. This is something I can really support and hopefully make some money later down the line when they decide to go public (or at least not lose money hopefully). If you have anything to share that you think is worth keeping an eye on please share :)

Sorry for the ramble but I think I better wrap it up here._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Lyft stock rises more than 10% after company reports signs of pandemic recovery Ride-hailing company Lyft reported fourth-quarter earnings on Tuesday.

The company beat Wall Street’s expectations on revenue and loss per share.

Its stock was up more than 9% in after-hours trading.

Active riders: 12.55 million vs. 13.2 million expected in a FactSet survey
Revenue per active rider: $45.40 vs. $42.20 expected per FactSet
The company’s revenue and ridership jumped from the prior quarter’s results of $499.7 million and 12.51 million riders, suggesting the company is continuing to recover from Covid-19 headwinds. However, it’s still considerably down from the same quarter last year. For the full year, Lyft reported revenue of $2.4 billion, compared with $3.6 billion in fiscal year 2019.

Definitions of the non-GAAP financial measures used in this press release and reconciliations of such measures to their nearest GAAP equivalents are included below under the heading “Use and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”

“We are excited to see the market for gaming and streaming product continue to grow at such a pace.  It is clear that a new wave of gamers and streamers has entered the market as well as consumers building gaming PCs for the first time.  Our expectation is that all these people that are new to the market will continue to buy gaming and streaming products from us for many years into the future.  I am particularly pleased that the revenue from our gaming components and systems segment is now over $1 billion.  And equally happy to see our gamer and creator peripherals segment grow by 83% and break through the half billion milestone.  Obviously this is amazing growth in both segments.  We continue to bring out exciting new product in all our product lines, and these seem to be resonating well with our current and new customers.  In fact our last three major product launches, the K100 keyboard, the Elgato Wave microphone, and the 4000X gaming case, are all showing near 5 star reviews at major retailers, and gained solid market share in a short time,” stated Andy Paul, Chief Executive Officer of Corsair.

“We are extremely pleased with our financial performance in the fourth quarter.  We have paid off an additional $50 million in debt during the quarter, making the total debt repayment $190 million for 2020.  We expect to continue to use our operating cashflows to reduce our debt and continue to invest in growth.  We also had a successful secondary offering this January, with all net proceeds going to the selling shareholders participating in the secondary,” said Michael G. Potter, Chief Financial Officer of Corsair.

Financial Outlook

For the full year 2021, we currently expect:

Net revenue to be in the range of $1.8 billion to $1.95 billion.
Adjusted operating income to be in the range of $205 million to $220 million.
Adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $215 million to $230 million.
Certain non-GAAP measures included in our financial outlook were not reconciled to the comparable GAAP financial measures because the GAAP measures are not accessible on a forward-looking basis. We are unable to reconcile these forward looking non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures without unreasonable efforts because we are currently unable to predict with a reasonable degree of certainty the type and extent of certain items that would be expected to impact GAAP measures for these periods but would not impact the non-GAAP measures. Such items may include stock-based compensation charges, public offering related charges, depreciation and amortization, severance, IPO costs and other items. The unavailable information could have a significant impact on our GAAP financial results.

The foregoing forward-looking statements reflect our expectations as of today's date. Given the number of risk factors, uncertainties and assumptions discussed below, actual results may differ materially. We do not intend to update our financial outlook until our next quarterly results announcement.

Please see “Use and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for a discussion on how we calculate the non-GAAP measures presented herein and a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measure.

Let's say a crash does happen soon, which sector or theme would you want to buy the most, if or when it does happen in the coming months?

As we all know, EV, marijuana, fintech, tech, genomics have all 5-20X'd since the start of the pandemic. The more famous investors such as Burry and Cathie Wood seem convinced that there will be a crash or at least a correction coming soon.

Also bonus question: What companies would you buy the most of within said bubble popping?

Personally for me it would probably be EV > weed > tech > genomics. With TSLA and NIO being the top 2 companies I would start buying. After that it would be APHA, and then from there stuff like SQ, NET, DKNG, SNOW, and LMND._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Collection of Finviz screeners Thanks to old posts on Redditt - I am posting Finviz screeners that other investors are using.

Hope everyone finds it  as useful as I did._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Selling Puts to Generate Yield in this Bubbly Market. Talk me out of it! Market feels a little frothy and I'm moving to cash. That said I still want to generate income on the idle cash in excess of money market rates (nil). I don't want to touch bonds as rising interest rates will crush long durations bonds and short term bonds are also generating nil returns. Looking for suggestions but am leaning towards selling puts.

My thought is to sell July 2021 puts on AVGO, MSFT, AAPL, TSM. Setting strikes for 25-35% discounts on these stocks would get you a rough return of 3-4% annualized. Nothing spectacular but beats money markets. In the event the market crashes before July, I would be happy to buy any of these stocks at the discount.

Let me know if you have better suggestions for names to sell puts on (without excessive risk) or other strategies to generate yield. I'm not inclined to buy high dividend yield stocks as those will still get dragged down in a market correction and then you are stuck holding them until they recover. I'd rather generate yield now while remaining liquid so I'm in a position to bottom feed after a correction._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Wash Sale and DCA down for gain need advice Trying my best to understand it but here we go..

- Buy 100 shares at 6.20 = 620.00

- Buy 100 shares at 7.27 = 727.50

Purpose: Average down 200 shares 6.74

Sell all FIFO at 6.81 (net gain 22.09)

Rebuy within a week:

- Buy 250 shares at $8.48.

- so 100 of my shares get washed and the cost basis for those shares becomes 8.94 (8.48+.46)

I plan on selling at a gain again but because some of my shares are washed, does this screw me over in the long run? I dont see any losses here so I'm not sure why they are washed unless the shares bought at 7.27 and sold for 6.81 screwed me?

Current $0.48. Jan 2020 $5.8.

One of the largest hire vehicle companies in the world

It is about to undergo massive restructuring in 2021. All of the resolutions necessary for the implementation of the financial restructuring plan have been approved last week: it will enable the group to finalise the implementation of this comprehensive plan, which notably contemplates a massive **reduction of the Group’s corporate debt by €1,100m** through equitisation and a significant new money injection, via capital increases1 and new fleet financing facilities (approx. €500m in total).

At the start of 2020 it was trading at just under $6 a share, it is now $0.40.

Holidaying and travel will open up again this summer and the next few years after, holidaying will boom. Europcar will directly benefit from this.

Last 3 years it had a **year on year revenue growth of 7.8%**

Has very high environmental standards- plans to make **35% of worldwide fleet electric/hybrid by 2023.** 

Received a gold rating from EcoVadis for ESG performance, second highest out of all hire companies.

This isn't financial advice._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Bumble set for IPO at $38-$40; projected to start trading Thursday How is everyone feeling about this IPO?

My broker is offering to (potentially) allocate me some shares at the IPO price. I'm probably going to pass on it, but want to make sure there isn't universal agreement that I'd be foolish to do that.

Normally, in the current market environment, I'd jump on any IPO they offer me. But I really question Bumble's sexist business model - just rubs me the wrong way. But as an old guy whose been married for 20 years, I'm not really in their target market.

So how to people in the target really feel about Bumble? I feel like Tinder, Match and Plenty of Fish are the preferred dating apps for most 20-somethings. Bumble seems like something that people go to once they get sick of the other ones as a last-ditch effort before abandoning online dating all together. Women go there once they're jaded and sick of receiving random dick picks; men go there once they're desperate and haven't gotten matches anywhere else (which seems like a self-defeating process since men have no control on Bumble).

I'm also not impressed by the "friend finder" and "Linked-In alternative" strategies. I feel like Linked in already fills that role and it's going to be tough to compete with the established platform. And I don't think that the population of people looking to make online friends for hanging out is a big population.

My personal negative view of the company makes me think it's not going to be successful long-term, and that it is unlikely to even have a first-day bump from the IPO price. If they price it at $40, I'd be surprised if it moves up from that much at all. I'd be more shocked by a $50 first-day close than a $35 close._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Debate between Husband and Wife on Investment strategy and philosophy.  

Debate between Husband and Wife on Investment strategy and philosophy.

**Let me explain this hypothetical scenario to you...**

You work in international business and times have been tough prior to right now. You just now land a deal that will put $2,000,000 in your pocket today, with that same amount recurring for the next 12 months. Your lifestyle is relatively simple and with that first payment, half of that will secure everything for your family including; house, cars, food, clothing, bills etc. for many years. The remaining 12 month payments will likely end up in other investments such as real estate or physical gold or silver, or perhaps as an investor in new businesses.

Prior to today and this deal, you have been studying the stock market heavily and enjoy the analysis and seeing how accurate you can be and was already thinking about spending most of your time on day trading for your basic income.

Now, both you and your wife fully agree on taking $1,000,000 from that first payment as money that can be lost in or used to make money in the stock market.

**How do you build your stock portfolio? Are you aggressive? How aggressive? Define that.**

Here are the points of view currently being debated.

**Husband - Very aggressive**

He says use all $1,000,000 on 1 or 2 individual stocks for very short term daily trades, focusing purely on the technical analysis on relatively volatile stocks, buy in the dip and sell on an upswing for a few percent quick gain. Repeat daily, never chasing large gains or long term gains.

**Wife - Slightly Aggressive**

She says what all financial advisors have always said (both husband and wife have done this professionally) and to diversify but to look at fundamentals along with technical analysis and make plays that will result in a couple percentage point gains per stock and may result in that over a short period of time such as days or weeks.

What would you do in this scenario? Would you agree with Husband or Wife? Or something completely different?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Consider A Globally-Diversified Leveraged Portfolio Hello,

Here's a portfolio for those with the willingness to take on risk for maximum returns (especially young savers).

**Explanation**

1) Choose a globally-diversified, low-expense set of smart-beta stock ETFs (tilting to factors that outperform like value, quality and momentum).

2) Use margin to leverage the portfolio to \~2:1, which is the optimal investment size for maximum returns as per the Kelly Criterion.

3) Sell short [SPX box spreads](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/fehabt/box_spread_financing_for_extremely_cheap_085/) in order to borrow near the risk-free rate (\~0.5%).

The portfolio is much more tax-efficient than using derivatives (since most gains stay unrealized). Historically (using US data back to 1929), the above portfolio would've indeed significantly outperformed the market. I don't care for past performance but it is always nice to confirm that the intuition indeed played out empirically.

**Positions**

I like a 50/30/20 split of US/Ex-US/EM (especially since International has attractive valuations). For the US, I like VFMF, VIOV and some VTI. For Ex-US, I like FNDF, ISCF, FNDE and EMGF.

**Brokerage**

Definitely Interactive Brokers. Their rock-bottom margin rates are vital. You can lower the rate further by selling [SPX boxes short](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/fehabt/box_spread_financing_for_extremely_cheap_085/).

**Rebalance**

As the market goes up, this strategy calls for you to buy more stocks to get the leverage back up to 2:1. You also need to sell stocks during market declines to keep maintain close to 2:1 leverage. This might seem "buy high, sell low" but there's no reliable way to time or mis-time the market so don't worry about that. Rebalancing is key to make sure you don't blow up and that you maintain a high CAGR long-term. I recommend rebalancing if leverage is outside 1.8-2.2x, or once a month. Don't rebalance too frequently (say, daily, like those leveraged ETFs), it's not optimal.

**Conclusion**

Leverage is taboo but if used properly, without overbetting, using well-diversified funds, it can be a useful portfolio for those looking to take on more risk for more reward (like myself)._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Long Term Investment Thoughts Hello, I am creating a EV portfolio for long term growth and these are my picks and why and just wanted your guys opinion on them. 

TSLA: Overall been a really big part of EV market and with the addition of the S&P 500 a while ago I have no reason to believe that they will not be part of the EV market still in the next 5-10+ years as the EV revolution will happen and TSLA will be there

NIO: Chinese stock and overall really good models and since they have batteries it will be even bigger in China as they need more cars and owning a Tesla which you  have to charge is not convenient as majority of people who live in China live in apartments

GM: This is a very long term plan but with the vision of trying to turn every car model into a EV model they will help tremendously with the whole EV revolution. The traditionally American SUV or Truck will be provided by GM car's not Tesla as we saw with the cybertruck 

WKHS: They have partnerships and probably will have more with other companies and providing them with EV vehicles and overall a really good long term investment I believe so

XL: I really like this because its like WKHS providing EV vehicles for other types of vehicles helping create EV vehicles of already existing vehicles not completely new ones._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ I watch Motley Fools new program offering video today So they have a new product coming out, I think its just called 10x. its an annual subscription service for $1,299 (lets see how well that'll sell lol) which they will release 40 companies that they think have potential to reach 10x valuation from where they are today.
