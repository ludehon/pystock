 Fed (Powell) affirmed commitment to low interest rates and massive bond purchases [Source](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/27/fed-meeting-live-updates-watch-jerome-powell-speech.html)

On bond purchases:
>Powell, in his press briefing, said talk of tapering is “premature” and the Fed would have to see improvement towards its goals before it would consider cutting back on purchases

On Fed's affect on markets:
>“There are many things that go into, as you know, setting asset prices. If you look at what’s really been driving asset prices in the last couple of months, it isn’t monetary policy,” Powell said. “It’s been expectations about vaccines, and it’s also fiscal policy.” “The connection between interest rates and asset values is probably something that’s not as tight as people think because a lot of different factors are driving asset prices at any given time,” the Fed chair added.

This seems like good news to me. This means the Fed won't pull back their printer simply because the market is over performing.

Powell's commitment seems like it will last a long time, for [he said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zzW_e2tyy0):

>We are a long way from a full recovery.

What does everyone think? It seems this is what investors were looking for -- further commitment to low interest rates and massive bond purchases. Shouldn't the market be up today?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Why is DraftKings (DKNG) preferred over FanDuel (as owned by FLTR)? While recent news has been flooded with *a certain short squeeze*, the potential growth of the betting market (particularly sports betting) in the US has been discussed heavily - as reflected by the popularity of the BETZ ETF. 

It’s a potential growth sector I’m interested in (alongside clean energy and genomics), and I appreciate an ETF may be a better option that trying to pick an outright winner. Particularly if the competition in the UK betting marketplace is anything to go by. That said, any company that creates a moat and dominates the growing US market is likely to be in a **much** stronger position globally.

So, as someone not in the US and so without the buzz of sports betting being a new / up and coming thing, why is DraftKings (DKNG) more popular than its competitor (with a larger market share), FanDuel (now owned by Flutter Entertainment - FLTR)? From looking into this on Reddit and elsewhere, there doesn’t seem to be any clear consensus that DKNG is far and away the better app / user experience. Is price point and the usual tech IPO excitement a big factor?

Looking at this from outside the US market (and as someone not currently invested in the betting market segment), FLTR seems like the obvious prime contender - given PaddyPower and Betfair (the merger which formed FLTR) already enjoy a large market cap in the EU, and have a lot more capital to throw behind marketing. PaddyPower in particular has been very successful at marketing within the UK and EU. Is the DKNG targeted advertising / brand and app experience that much better? Or is the comparative price point of $54 for DKNG a particular lure for people to take a punt on, compared to $191 for FLTR?

Are there other real contenders in the US market, beyond other EU heavyweights like William Hill (WMH)?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ FB earnings beat What a time we live in.

I LIKE THE STOCK
I LIKE THE STOCK
 I LIKE THE STOCK
 I LIKE THE STOCK_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Bloomberg Opinion: GameStop Is Rage Against the Financial Machine I know, everyone is tired of hearing about Gamestop, but this was something I came across that I thought was actually quite well written and pretty spot on with most of the anger driven rhetoric I've seen on Reddit.  

I've copy/pasted because I know most of y'all don't have Bloomberg subscriptions.  

> **Traders putting on the short squeeze aren’t motivated by greed. They’re engaged in an anger-driven uprising against the establishment.**

>**Anger Is an Energy**


>The saga of GameStop Corp. continues. By the end of another frenetic day of trading Tuesday, the stock had just topped its high from Monday. Between those peaks, it staged a fall of more than 50% on Monday afternoon. Colleagues have followed these extraordinary developments as they happened. I will try for now simply to process the single most important question: Is this just a weird technical situation, of the kind that comes along every few years, that can otherwise be safely ignored? Or does it tell us something important about market conditions as a whole?

>GameStop's share price surged back to set a new high
Purely qualitatively, based on what I have witnessed, I think it does matter. The signal it sends is disquieting, if not surprising. It also introduces us to a new variant on an ancient market phenomenon.

>The cliche is that market capitalism works on the balance between greed and fear.  The standard defense is as follows: If the greed to make money by beating the competition is matched by a fear of failure through making too many mistakes or cutting corners, then capitalism works. Nothing else yet discovered gives people such an incentive to work and create growth. Speculative bubbles happen when greed becomes excessive, or when fear diminishes too much. Easy money and easier trading with derivatives oil these emotions and allow them to run riot. The financial crisis of 2008 happened in large part because years of policy had convinced investors that there would be a bailout if they failed; they lost their fear, and greed took over. 


>This feeds into the debate over whether we have a speculative bubble at present. Markets are pervaded by gloom and worry, so there is no lack of fear — even if confidence that interest rates will never rise is growing excessive. Meanwhile, there is little in the way of greed. Cryptocurrency has generated excitement, as has Tesla Inc., but in the main the frenzy over a historic opportunity to get rich, of the kind that was everywhere in 1999, is lacking. This is a different, worried world. The last two decades have stripped it of its positivity. The mood is nothing like the great bubbles of the past.

>Instead of greed, this latest bout of speculation, and especially the extraordinary excitement at GameStop, has a different emotional driver: anger. The people investing today are driven by righteous anger, about generational injustice, about what they see as the corruption and unfairness of the way banks were bailed out in 2008 without having to pay legal penalties later, and about lacerating poverty and inequality. This makes it unlike any of the speculative rallies and crashes that have preceded it. 

>On Monday, I argued that it was misplaced to take pleasure at the pain for the short-sellers who had attacked GameStop stock, and then been subjected to a “short squeeze” for the ages by traders coordinating on Reddit. I received a bumper crop of feedback. Here are some representative samples (leaving out many with unprintable expletives):

>>“You kind of miss the point of what is going on with GameStop. How much did Melvin pay you to write this garbage? shill. Literally trying to protect an industry trying to fleece jobs from low income workers. Sleep well chump.” 

>>“Watching entitled institutional shorts whine on TV and OP EDs that millennials equipped with margin accounts & zero fees are collaborating on Reddit to target them is my new favorite sport. Looks perfectly healthy from where I'm sitting, which is on bull side :) plus 1 for the little guys.”

>>“Normal isn't putting the retail trader down for being independent while organized hedge funds force you to take their way or suffer in fear. Normal is the American dream and being able to make your own way. This isn't a casino. This is a riot.”

>One respondent warned that the people squeezing the shorts aren’t “a herd of impressionable youngsters with Robinhood accounts. No. They are an experienced & ruthless army of insomniacs followed by a silent legion of rapidly learning new traders. This is a new paradigm that won’t go away.”

>Another told me I was a “dumb boomer” amid a screed of unprintable epithets. (Point of information: I’m just too young to be a boomer. I’m in Generation X, but it’s the intergenerational antagonism that’s noteworthy.) Another said that the short squeeze was just a way for millennials to recoup the money they had been forced to pay to bankers during the TARP rescue 12 years ago, and to put coronavirus relief checks to work:

>>“In other words, poor people have too much money and are now controlling the narrative. Damn those $1200 stimulus checks and $600 unemployment supplements. Too much liquidity, let's get these folks back to living paycheck to paycheck.”

>>“I know. Democratisation of the market is so damned inconvenient for those of us with money.”

>>“nobody cares about your hedge fund cronies!”

>>“Bloomberg defending the suits. Not surprised. They’re just mad the rubes are in on the joke now. Might this force the Fed’s hand? Too many regular people in on the game.”
 

>This is all fascinating. In the space of 12 years, the role of the short-seller has turned on its head. Back in 2008, it was the shorts who upset the status quo, revealed what was rotten in the state of Wall Street, and brought down the big shots. They were even the heroes of a big movie. It was the Wall Streeters who attacked them.

>Alienation has deepened since then. Short-selling hedge funds are now seen as part of a corrupt establishment, as is the media. The motives of anyone defending the shorts, or anyone wearing a suit, must be suspect. And there is a deep generational divide; those unable to own their own home and forced to rely on defined contribution pensions have a stunningly unfair deal compared to those a generation older, living in mortgage-free homes with guaranteed pensions. That percolates into anger, and a determination to right the scales by making money at the expense of corrupt short-sellers. 

>We lack precedents for an angry bubble, so predictions are even harder than usual. But there are enough similarities with past incidents to raise serious cause for concern.

>First, the little guys have had their success so far with the aid of margin accounts, and by using derivatives. We know what happens when these things are used to excess; even the Dutch tulipmania relied on margin debt and derivatives. Little guys (and everyone else) deserve safer tools with which to build wealth.

>Second, “democratization of finance” isn’t new, and in itself is nothing that anyone can object to. The problem is that investment and financial planning are difficult, and require time. Regulate these things, and you no longer have true democratization. Leave people free to take chances, and you get disasters like the bursting of the dot-com bubble in 2000. That also followed plenty of hype about the success of the “little guy,” and the first great explosion of online discount trading succeeded in sucking an army of new retail investors into the bubble’s final climax. Unregulated “democratization” led to the little guy bearing the brunt of the losses.

>“Democratizing” finance also leaves newly enfranchised financial citizens prey to spivs and frauds. I started my career covering the disastrous repercussions of one of Margaret Thatcher’s last reforms in the U.K. — giving people the right to leave their defined-benefit pensions, offered by employers, and take on defined-contribution “personal pensions.” Unscrupulous salesmen persuaded miners, firefighters and police officers to abandon copper-bottomed index-linked pensions for plans that came burdened with excessive charges. It was a repellent spectacle, and the bill for compensation was in the billions.

>These points doubtless make me appear to be a complacent shill for the financial industry, talking down to the rubes. For the record, I’m still angry about the way workers were ripped off in Britain more than three decades ago, and about the way the little guy ended up bearing the brunt for the financial implosions of 2000 and 2008. But it looks horribly to me as though the same thing is going to happen again — and I don’t think the answer to today’s many ills is to empower poor people to bankrupt themselves with margin accounts and derivatives.

>Anger, even more than greed, has the capacity to make us throw caution to the winds. Many of us have a lot to be angry about. If this carries on, and spreads beyond targets like a video-game retailer, I don’t want to see the consequences when history’s first angry bubble bursts.

I'm relatively new to investing,  but browsing forums, reading charts, and doing (somewhat amateur) DD, I  think I have a list of some good investments that can be held for a year  or longer. I'm not posting a full DD for each company, just some points  I find interesting, mostly the values and projections for each. For  disclosure's sake, I am NOT currently invested in any of these companies  except for MRNA and RVP.

FLGT:

If  hearing "sales growth of 880%" doesn't perk up your ears I don't know  what will, the last 12 months have been booming for Fulgent Genetics.  They have exceeded analysts projected earnings estimates by 501% and  277% the last two quarters. This fella is undervalued with those  numbers, even with the stock price up 60% in January alone. Currently  going for about $83 but valued around $140. If you buy now you would be  buying at the top, but it's still projected to go higher.

MRNA:

This  is one of the two stocks on this list that I am currently invested in  (approx 9% of my portfolio). While not \*quite\* as impressive as FLGT's  880% sales growth, Moderna's 826% sales growth over the last year is  still fantastic. One of the most undervalued stocks on this list with  the current price only about 53% of it's current value, Moderna has a  lot of potential. MRNA is up 55% already in 2021. Moderna reported only  $60 million in sales in 2019, but are projected to have between 1.5 to  15 billion in 2021. That's a huge window, but even if they hit the  lowest projection it will be fantastic for the company. Again, you would  be buying high if you went in now, but it looks like right now is the  lowest it will be for the foreseeable future.

NVAX:

This  company fascinates me the most on this list. The current price is less  than half of the current value. Phenomenal upside potential, with unreal  sales growth in the last 12 months at 999%. Novavax stock has rocketed  1302% in the last year. Reported 2019 sales of 18.7 million with 2021  sales projections ranging from 1.2 to 4.7 billion. While 999% sales  growth was impressive, the projected annual sales growth is an  astounding 2,815%. I almost wonder if this one is too good to be true,  which is why I haven't invested yet, but I am beyond tempted.

HZO:

Up  34% this month. Reported earnings the last two quarters exceeded  analyst projections by 120% and 177%. Undervalued with excellent sales  growth. The current quarter looks like it might be mediocre for  MarineMax, but the year-long forecasts look great. Undervalued by about  33%, the potential upside for MarineMax is solid.

DQ:

Daqo  New Energy's stock has been exploding, up 910% in the past year. It's  slightly undervalued, currently selling for around $100 but valued  closer to $118. They have had sales growth of 51% over the last year  with projected rates going much, much higher. One to keep an eye on.

MKSI:

MKS  Instruments is the first stock listed that offers a dividend. At $0.80  annually per share with a dividend growth of 10%, it's a nice cherry on  top to what looks like a good investment. Up 13% this year, MKSI has a  median projected growth of 17% for the next 12 months. Their earnings  exceeded projections all of the last four quarters each between 8% and  36%. MKSI has been in a dip the last week, down about 10%. If you're  thinking about buying, now would be a good time.

RVP:

The  second stock I am invested in on this list (approx 16% of my  portfolio), Retractable Technologies stock is up 50% in January. I see  an earnings growth rate around 40% after they had 133% sales growth over  the last 12 months. Like all these other picks, RVP is undervalued,  presently going for $16 with a current value closer to $26.

LRCX:

Up  12% this month, Lam Research doesn't have numbers quite as sexy as the  others on this list but it's worth looking at. Earnings exceeded  forecasts by 9% and 17% the last two quarters. Undervalued by about  $170, I see LRCX having plenty of room to grow, especially with their  earnings projected to grow by 45%.

WILD CARD: PLTR

Palantir  Tech isn't really a wild card, but it breaks from the rest of the list  by being massively OVERvalued at $38, when the current value is much  closer to $3. It's up 61% in January, but 12 months projections look  grim, with even the best outlooks predicting a 20% decrease in stock  price. The reason I put it on this list is because I do think it will  grow years from now, mostly from what happened earlier this week. Lots  of people, especially software developers, were amazed with Palantir's  Gotham presentation, many of them saying it could be a major player in  the future. I think the stock price will definitely decline, which is  why I'm not buying in now, but it will be worth revisiting when it  drops.

Like I said, very amateur  DD done for these guys, primarily looking at past and projected sales  and stock price vs value, with some consideration given to price  volatility, price decline resistance, dividends, and timing price  trends. Let me know what you think._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ BlockBuster Video is up 2,000% over the past two days. This has become a total clown market BB Liquidating Inc. formerly known as BlockBuster Video.

New IPO, gaming industry has been EXPLODING, and Q4 Earnings containing (likely record) holiday season sales are about to drop in 1-2 weeks. In the midst of a speculative buying frenzy, theres one stock I've had my eye on that seems to have real fundamentals to back up the price punch.  IMO Corsair is probably one of the most overlooked tech stocks on the market right now.

It's up over **165%** since IPO last year, risen **20%** today, but I think theres still a LONG way to go.

\- [CRSR](https://www.google.com/finance/quote/CRSR:NASDAQ) is a relatively new IPO, but a time-tested tech company in the explosive gaming industry, which has been among the best performing sectors throughout 2020. Thus far its been overlooked for bigger players like LOGITECH.

\- Their Q4 earnings reports are about to release on 2/9. They'll contain holiday season sales. Every related company in that space has been posting record Q4 sales.

\- IN 2019 they crossed $1bln revenue for the first time. If current revenue trends continue, its going to be approaching $2bln revenue for 2020. By several metrics they're growing FASTER than LOGI, at less than half the price.

\- Their market cap is currently  **$4.17 Billion ....**  Compare that to LOGI at **$18 Billion.** Despite TTM revenues approaching 50% of LOGI, the market cap is more than 4x lower. If you think LOGI is fairly priced (or under valued), then CRSR has a lot of room to go up.

\- They have recently been making some big acquisitions throughout 2019 and 2020, notably in the rapidly expanding streaming space where they're building market dominance (Snapping up Elgato was a big one).

\- Less diluted than LOGI (Looking at RPS, only 38% lower)

\- It blew past EPS estimates in Q2 and Q3. After Q3 earnings report share price doubled in 2 weeks. I think Q4 EPS estimates are very low. I see it absolutely crushing them.

\- Net Profit Margins have been increasing every quarter in 2020.  All other fundamentals are on a positive trajectory.... net debt going down, gross margins going up.

&#x200B;

The bottom line was that Chamath was pushing the point that Hedge funds have had the advantage until now, but with social media being where it is, a bunch of retail investors with a cellphone can take the other side of a trade and be effective at it.

&#x200B;

I felt that Scott Wapner was pushing for him to admit  that GME is horribly mispriced, which it really is on  massive scale, but Chamath did not give him that, instead pushing the narrative that the hedge funds being 200% short the float is what is really wrong and the time has come where retail traders are leveling the playing field.

Forgive me if I am posting in the wrong sub

I'll start with Charles Schwab.

I had around $300 in my Schwab brokerage account. I wanted to use another brokerage besides Robinhood so I made transfers from my bank account to start out. Then on December 27th, I started a transfer of $3000 from my Bank of America account to my Charles Schwab brokerage account. The Schwab account was then suspended for suspicious activity on December 29th. I called Schwab on December 30th, and they told me that the fraud department is investigating, and it can take 3-5 business days, maybe longer because it was the holiday season. I said OK, called back a week later, and they said the same thing, called another week later, they said the same thing again. Called them about 5 or 6 times, and they always say that they need 3 to 4 or 3 to 5 business days to investigate. Well, it's now January 27 and my account is still locked for suspicious activity.

When I try to ask them what they are investigating, they will never tell me. How can I get access to my money?

Does it usually take this long?

If i do nothing, how long would it take to complete the investigation? months, years?

Is it legal for them to hold my money for this long?

Amazon has been going up (over the past 5 years) on average 85% per year.

&#x200B;

If we can say that this year it also goes up 85% (as it has been for the past 5 years), the stock price will be around $6000.

thank you._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Salarius Pharmaceuticals (SLRX), two Strong catalysts in 2021 Salarius has two phase 1 trials for advanced solid tumors and Ewing Sarcoma. 

Advanced solid tumors phase I trial will enroll patients with advanced solid tumors who have progressed on prior therapy, for example patients with prostate, breast, ovarian, lung and other sarcomas. Depending on the cancer, LSD1 can associate with a myriad of proteins to drive tumor growth. Depending on the cancer, LSD1 can associate with a myriad of proteins to drive tumor growth. For instance, in prostate cancer LSD1 can associate with the androgen receptor to activate genes that promote cancer cell growth and metastasis. Seclidemstat is able to block these interactions and reduce tumor burden.

Salarius began enrolling for a Phase 1 trial in Ewing sarcoma in 2018. Ewing sarcoma is a devastating pediatric illness and represents a major unmet clinical need. Currently, chemotherapy, radiation and tumor resection surgery are the only options for patients, and in many cases the tumors reoccur or is in too delicate of a location to risk surgery. There is a 70-90% five-year mortality rate for patients whose tumors recur after treatment or who are initially diagnosed with metastatic disease. Translocations involving the EWS gene are the sole driver for over 85% of Ewing sarcoma, and the EWS protein must complex with LSD1 to induce a cancer phenotype. Seclidemstat blocks this LSD1-EWS interaction to reverse cancer pathology resulting in cures in animal models.

Salarius expect additional Ewing data trial in Q1 2021 and Advanced Solid tumors data in 1H 2021._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Microsoft (MSFT) vs Intel (INTC)  We constantly compare stocks in similar sectors. Below an extract of our comparison between Microsoft and Intel

&#x200B;

One of our key metrics is the Price to Stockholders equity per share ratio. When looking at this we find the following:

* Price/Stockholders equity per share for Microsoft: 13.5
* Price/Stockholders equity per share for Intel Corp : 2.8

Based on this metric Intel Corp offers far more value than Microsoft. Most firms tend to trade at a ratio of between 2 and 5 times. While Intel trades within this range the stock if Microsoft is trading well outside this expected range. So what is the stockholders equity per share you ask? Well if a firm sells all assets, pays all its debts and distributes the rest to its stockholders, the stockholders equity per share shows what each stockholders will get. Thus the higher this ratio the less you will get out per stock compared to what you are paying for it. So Microsofit that is trading at 13.5 times it stockholders equity you will only get 7.5% of its current stock price out of they were to sell all assets, pay all debt and distribute the rest to stockholders. In the case of Intel you would get out 35.7% of its current stock price  


Next up cash as percentage of stock price:

* Cash as percentage of stock price for Microsoft: 0.81%
* Cash as percentage of stock price for Intel Corp : 2.6%

Next up lets take a look at the percentage cash on the balance sheet makes up of each group's total assets:

* Cash as percentage of stock price for Microsoft: 4.7%
* Cash as percentage of stock price for Intel Corp : 3.8%

Looking at the cash position of the three firms Microsoft has the strongest cash position (as a percentage of their total assets). The cash per share gives an indication of if investors were to buy the stock now, how much of that stock price is made up by cash on their balance sheet. In this case its Intel that comes out on top with 2.6% of their current stock price being made up by cash.   


Next the overused but still useful metric, the Price to Earnings Ratio (PE):

* PE for Microsoft:29
* PE for Intel Corp : 9.8

So  Intel has the lower PE ratio of the two firms looked at in this comparison  


Price/Stock Valuation ratio:

* Price/Stock Valuation for Microsoft: 1.27
* Price/Stock Valuation for Intel Corp : 0.76

Based on the Price/Stock valuation metric it is Intel that comes out as the winner as its trading at well below our stock price target while Microsoft is trading at well above our stock valuation for it.  


If we have to chose one of these two tech giants, based on their stock price performance, their financial results and other financial ratios we rate the stock of Intel as the **winner**._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Energy Transfer Partners ET Anyone else watching this one?

Hedge fund Melvin Capital closed out its short position in videogame retailer GameStop Corp., [CNBC reported](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/27/hedge-fund-targeted-by-reddit-board-melvin-capital-closed-out-of-gamestop-short-position-tuesday.html) Wednesday. Fund manager Gabe Plotkin told CNBC's Andrew Ross Sorkin that the position was closed out Tuesday afternoon following a huge loss. Shares of GameStop have soared more than 600% in January after retail investors, organized via Reddit's WallStreetBets forum and other platforms, sought to push up a handful of heavily shorted stocks. Hedge funds Citadel and Point72 infused nearly $3 billion into Melvin Capital to shore up the fund, news reports said earlier this week. Plotkin told CNBC that speculation the fund would file for bankruptcy is false. Shares of GameStop trimmed premarket gains after the report but remained up 56%.

They don't have the asset price inflation bubble you're seeing in the West or Asia, because COVID has hit Latin America hard. But they're also middle income countries that are high growth compared to the West, and they are less of a crapshoot than, say, Southeast Asia or Africa emerging markets.

Many, if not most of them actually declined in value this year.

I'm not saying they're a good investment right now, but they seem to be cheap at the moment, and they have a really good medium and long term outlook once COVID is over.

Any thoughts?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Simple options question about delta. I've been trying to fully understand options and I decided to manually check the math of my options contract profits, and I ran into some issues.

&#x200B;

Let's say that tomorrow morning, I want to buy 1 contract of BNFT with a strike price of $15. The expiration date is February 19th and the price of the contract is $0.33. The current stock price of BNFT is $13.50.

&#x200B;

So I go on Robinhood, and look for that exact option contract. I notice that the DELTA for this contract is right at 0.2758. So this seems easy, if the stock price went up exactly one dollar all I would have to do to calculate the worth of the contract would be to add the delta + price of contract, so 0.33 + 0.2758. This comes out to a value of approx $0.61.

&#x200B;

So I go to check my math against the optionsprofitcalculator site and I'm way off. Apparently the worth of the contract would actually be $0.69 if the stock price hit $14.50. So instead of profiting $27 I would be profiting $36. This is a pretty big difference and wondering where I went wrong, and where that extra value came from? Is there something else you add to the (contract price + delta) when your stock goes up that first dollar? Thanks.

I think it is the best stock in Energy Sector currently.

&#x200B;

STOCK TICKER: OXY

Current Price: $20.38

Short Volume: Around 60%

OXY has been an easy target for short sellers for more than a year.

OXY was so undervalued due to Energy sector, and 3.8 B loss in 3rd quarter.

1. OXY is one of top 3 shale oil company in US. It was expected to be TOP 1 or TOP 2 in 2020 if there was no COVID-19. With a high priced merger in 2019, OXY tanked all in 2020.

**P/E raito is still -1.28** which is crazy as other Energy companies (CVX -13.95, BP -3.58, TOT -19.14, PSX -11,76, RDS A -8.9)

OXY's position : **break even is $35** for crude oil price (current crude Oil price $52.77) WHY is OXY Shorted STILL???

**OXY makes $17.77/ each Barrel (34%)**

According to Merill, at **$47 WTI, unlevered free cash will be $4.1 BN** which will exceed 3rd quarter loss.

We are expecting huge surprise on earning.

2. To use Biden’s green Energy, Crude oil price has to be above $75 (42%higher than the current price) which is currently (**$52.77**). Green Energy companies were peaked when Crude oil price was over $100 in 2007\~2008. And, due to Russia event, the crude oil price will jump soon or later. Russia was the one who opposed Oil production cut down but they are busy with politics in the homeland. (Hope for the best)

3. Many Energy companies including OXY, they are changing carbon free production which will benefit them financially and investing on Green Energy sector.

4.  **short volume (60%)**, Why does individual investors have to suffer from firms' short positions?

5. The Legend, **Carl Icahn**, is still on OXY. He is heavily invested in OXY position.

For  better or worse, there will always be a segment of men interesting in  increasing their testosterone levels, whether to find the fountain of  youth or simply to make themselves "bigger, faster, stronger." In that  sense, oral testosterone, such as Lipocine offers, will always hold a  fascination and value for some. And of course, most of us, should we  choose to take testosterone, would prefer it orally rather than say, as a  needle shot into the buttocks. At the same time, that also means that,  because they are answering an eternal need, that they are also going to  be inevitably competing against a wide field of competitors.

Lipocine's  TLANDO oral testosterone product has "tentative" USDA approval, but so  to do does Jatenzo and in fact, Jatenzo has a head-start in the market,  having gained its approval in 2019, versus TLANDO's tentative approval  gained roughly a month ago. However dangerous or safe either may be,  Jatenzo has a head start making it's case to clients and an extra year  of results, such as they may be, to boast of. One most also wonder  whether how many, of those interested in testosterone, would be not be  willing to simply go the route of the "black market" or to simply pursue  all the many products offered in the pages of various bodybuilding  magazines, many of which are thinly disguised forms of anabolic steroids  under other names.

What's also  interesting is that when I look for Jatenzo, most of the results that  come up are directly regarding the product itself, some of them with  charismatic figures who are clearly experienced in product advocacy  discussing it's alleged benefits. In the case of Lipocine or Tlando,  most of the results are related directly to the stock itself and it's  currently favorable fortunes.

The  million dollar question for Lipocine is, how could Tlando differentiate  itself from Jatenzo and other competitors, legal or otherwise? If it is  safer than Tlando and more effective, one would presume that this could  only become known in time and in the interim, how is Lipocine going to  establish itself? I own some stock in Lipocine and so far, it's done  pretty well, but I wonder how the product itself will perform once the  stock-related hype dies out._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Barrons: China’s own numbers as well as independently collected economic data do not tell the story of a blockbuster rebound. Instead, they show a full-year recession hiding in plain sight,” with economic numbers being “wildly inflated” https://www.barrons.com/articles/the-great-chinese-rebound-not-so-fast-51611622798

China has officially become the world’s only major economy to expand year-over-year in 2020, with 2.3% real GDP growth. That’s an especially bright figure against the backdrop of an estimated 4.3% contraction in the overall global economy, pulled down by severe recessions in the U.S. and the euro zone. Investors, expecting this outcome for months, have been pouring into Chinese equities and commodities, boosting assets to record levels while also fueling a self-reinforcing China comeback narrative.

The problem? The People’s Republic of China’s own numbers as well as independently collected economic data do not tell the story of a blockbuster rebound. Instead, they show a full-year recession hiding in plain sight.

A close look at official Chinese statistics reveals that key economic numbers have been wildly inflated. Downward revisions to their 2019 baselines created the appearance of growth, when in fact the economy continued to struggle in 2020.

Let’s begin with the all-important numbers for fixed asset investment, which counts total purchases of capital goods and land. Published at a high frequency, this metric is seen as a leading indicator of the health of the Chinese economy. In a series of revisions over the course of 2020, China’s statistics bureau cut the aggregate amount of 2019 FAI down by over 4.7 trillion yuan (equivalent to about $720 billion). The largest revisions came in the fall, raising immediate analyst concerns.

These revisions helped Beijing create the illusion of a V-shaped recovery in investment spending. The revised 2020 FAI figures show investment cratering in the wake of the pandemic but then recovering rapidly and surreptitiously expanding above the previous year’s levels in the final four months of 2020. By quietly changing the baseline, China masked what was in fact a year-long contraction in investment spending. When aggregated over the full year, the unadjusted data show FAI shrinking roughly 5.9% compared to 2019.

The baseline for another critical metric, total retail sales, which gauges consumer strength, was also revised down, showing positive on-year growth each month since August 2020. The original figures indicated positive growth starting a month later, in September, and at a slower rate for the remainder of the year. More importantly, they show that in aggregate total retail sales contracted year-over-year by 4.8% or approximately 1.97 trillion yuan. Even based on the retroactively revised data, accumulated retail sales fell by 3.9% in 2020 compared to the previous year.

No matter how you slice the official numbers, they reject the idea of China seeing a broad-based recovery that includes Chinese consumers.

That said, official economic statistics are routinely revised. So why should revisions by China be treated skeptically?

First, the methods of China’s National Bureau of Statistics have long been questionable. A central problem is a practice by which firms surveyed in a given year are dropped in future years if their revenue falls below a certain threshold. Their prior data is then stripped out of historical records. This cherry-picking approach can produce trillions of yuan worth of adjustments. The resulting figures are no longer representative of the entire economy.

Second, transparency is lacking. The NBS did not provide a meaningful explanation of why numbers for FAI or total retail sales were adjusted down for 2019, nor did it publish a revised series openly acknowledging the revisions. Third, and relatedly, the bureau has now removed all nominal FAI data for 2019 and 2020 from its online database, making it cumbersome for analysts to decode these changes in the first place. It’s difficult but to conclude that these revisions are aimed at distorting reality rather than giving a more accurate read on the economy.

Reliability of official statistics is not the only reason to question if China’s economy actually grew in 2020. Private data also do not show an economy running at pre-Covid levels.

My firm, China Beige Book, surveys over 3,000 Chinese executives every quarter. These proprietary surveys show the economy continuing to recover into the fourth quarter. But each of our key performance metrics, every sector, and all regions posted a fourth consecutive quarter of on-year contraction, a first in a decade of surveying the Chinese economy.

Our data show that China’s recovery over 2020 has been less robust than official numbers portray. Chinese consumption remains weak. The fourth quarter brought a services sector recovery, but one driven by businesses not consumers. Consumer-facing sectors like travel, hospitality, and restaurants lagged behind business-to-business industries. Retailing fared even worse, becoming the only sector with slower growth in the fourth quarter.

Even Chinese executives do not say their businesses have fully recovered. Last quarter we asked C-level executives when they expected their companies’ sales, profitability, and hiring to return to 2019 levels. On each metric, approximately two-thirds said that recovery was still more than three months away. Beijing has declared victory prematurely.

By claiming growth in several key metrics, Beijing signaled to markets that it would eventually report year-on-year expansion in the economy and achieve the mythical V-shaped recovery. Many investors and market commentators latched on to that narrative with little interest in looking under the hood. And herein lies the problem. Not only does a forensic review of official data show a weaker economy than officially acknowledged, but both government statistics and independent data show lackluster consumption.

Rising investment flows into China and a rally in Chinese stocks may very well be justified by virtue of China’s recovery over the past 9 months, which is no doubt impressive compared to most of the rest of the still-suffering world. But these investments should not be driven by official GDP growth or a belief that China’s economy has returned to normal. The evidence simply does not bear that out._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Best way to import ticker prices into Google Sheet? I believe the best long term way to track my portfolio is through a personal Google Sheet so I don't get tied to specific software that can lose data or potentially disappear over time. One challenge that I am facing is importing the real time prices of my tickers/ISIN: at the moment I am using the Google Sheet command "[IMPORThtml](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/3093339?hl=en)" but it's pretty inefficient and convoluted to use.

Any tips_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Is this too good to be true? (BioHarvest Sciences) Long time lurker here doing my first reddit post ever, so be nice. Hopefully this doesn’t sound like a straight up ad or go against any r/investing rules.

I stumbled across this little company, BioHarvest Sciences ([www.bioharvest.com)](http://www.bioharvest.com)/), recently when I saw someone mention it in a youtube comment. I looked into them out of curiosity and ended up researching them for three straight days because I was so excited about what they were doing. I was one of the Tesla bears during its run up (“it’s not even profitable, blah blah blah”), but now I understand the enthusiasm that was behind it. Here’s the gist of what I found. Full disclaimer I’m no expert on any of this and am 20,000 shares in.

**Who is BioHarvest Sciences?**

BioHarvest is a Canadian company with its operations based in Israel at the moment. Up until very recently they’ve been a pure R&D company developing their technology, and now they’re ready to monetize it. What is this technology? It’s Biofarming. From what I understand they take a plant and isolate the beneficial properties of it into cell form, then grow those specific cells to eventually be processed into a consumable powder (no more having to eat your fruits and veggies kids). Here’s what’s exciting about that. They only need the actual plant once. When they get what they want out of the plant in cell form it goes into a cell bank where it can be reused for future production runs. It only takes a few weeks to grow a batch of cells opposed to sometimes an entire year for traditional crops. Another huge thing is that one bioreactor, which is about the size of a person and where the biofarming takes place, is equivalent to crops taking up 10,000 square meters of land. It also cuts out all of the environmental variables of farming like weather, moldy crops, having to use pesticides, etc. which translates to a level of consistency where each production run is identical to the last. The cells they farm are what are naturally found in the plants, so they are non-GMO. In a world concerned about health, sustainability and the environment, as well as the talk about possible food shortages in the future, this is possibly a big win. By the way, they are the only company in the world doing this and have multiple patents on the proprietary technology.

**So how are they going to make money?**

They have one product out now in Israel called Vinia, where they took all of the goodness out of red grape skins and put it into a pill. One pill equals one entire bottle of red wine, the healthy part of red wine that is (no sugar, alcohol, calories, etc.). It has only been available in Israel for a few months I believe, but has seen increased sales month after month. In April they’re planning on expanding into the US and are close to completion on a new 20-ton facility (compared to the current 2-ton facility they have now) so they can meet the expected future demand. What does Vinia do? Here are the claims which all meet FDA guidelines:

\-Supports a healthy heart

\-Increases elasticity of arteries and blood vessels

\-Supports healthy arteries

\-Supports blood circulation

\-Supports blood pressure already within normal range

\-Fuels antioxidant activity within your veins and arteries

\-Improves physical energy and alertness via increased blood flow and oxygen to tissues and organs

It’s not a cure for anything but a preventative health measure which people are more concerned about now with this pandemic. BioHarvest will also be selling their products to health professionals where they already have a purchase order with Designs for Health ([www.designsforhealth.com](http://www.designsforhealth.com/)), a nutritional product supplier to professionals in North America and Australia. What got my interest with Vinia is that it can also be used as a natural food ingredient that improves the shelf life of products it’s in because it’s so anti-oxidant rich. BioHarvest already has a partnership with Batory foods ([www.batoryfoods.com](http://www.batoryfoods.com/)), a leading food ingredient supplier in the US, to penetrate this market. They plan on using an “Intel Inside” approach where they slap the Vinia logo on the box of anything that contains it to raise awareness. Just this one initial product seems to have lots of potential. Vinia is part of BioHarvest’s “superfruits” line, where they have an olive (good for cholesterol) and pomegranate (anti-inflammatory) product already in the pipeline.

They also have another line they plan on releasing in 2022… cannabis. Cannabis is a plant (duh) so they do the same process I talked about above, get all of the goodies out of the plant into cell form and then grow those individual cells. This means they can make CBD/THC in a pure and consistent form. Big companies like Kelloggs and Coca-Cola (which the CEO has experience working for btw) only use ingredients which are 100% consistent, because if they don’t there will be variations in each batch of their end products. BioHarvest could deliver, for example, CBD that is always identical from one batch to the next and under 0.3% THC which is a legal requirement. I believe this is why you haven’t seen any CBD beverages or anything from a major corporation… that could change. For THC, it sounds like BioHarvest will be able to create their own “strains” of cells which have different qualities. This means you will know exactly what the THC/CBD levels are and what the effects will be. This is great for recreational use, but more importantly, crucial for pharmaceutical companies. In the future they could possibly do this with psilocybin which is being used in clinical trials right now to treat things like depression.

Now keep in mind they can do this with any plant as far as I know so the future opportunities seem almost endless.

In 2022 they plan on expanding into Europe, Canada, Japan, and Australia.

**Why should I invest?**

This is a young company that just began generating revenues so financials do not look great right now. You can find all of their filings including financial statements here [https://www.thecse.com/en/listings/life-sciences/bioharvest-sciences-inc](https://www.thecse.com/en/listings/life-sciences/bioharvest-sciences-inc)

It looks like they have enough cash to cover their expenses over the next couple of years and the CEO says they plan on the superfruits line being breakeven by the end of 2021 and profitable from thereon out. If they need extra cash they have had no problem raising money in the past from multiple share issuances (bad for dilution, I know). A plus is that their most recent private placement was over 2x the price per share of the previous ones due to the run up of the share price, so less shares are required to raise the amount of cash they may need. Also it’s a penny stock so it’s risky with some big swings and low volume but this is a long term speculative play. I think this has the potential to be huge.

On the positive side, they have an extremely low cost of capital compared to traditional farming and can easily grow and expand the company due to their Biofarming technology. It’s literally like a cut and paste move if they want to expand their production capacity. They just find a building, install their bioreactors in it and they’re good to go. If they want to use a bioreactor for a different product (different plant cells), the CEO said it only takes about a week or so to make the switch. Speaking of the CEO, Ilan Sobel, he seems extremely passionate about the company and he’s charismatic which helps. He explains everything much better than I did, so check out their youtube channel if you want to hear it all straight from him:

The company seems super transparent and will answer questions directly if you contact them (besides any secrets behind their technology and competitive strategy obviously). They also fit into the sustainable investing narrative that’s being pushed, the company plans to get third party verification in that regard. Maybe I’m just being naïve and one of you guys can find some major flaws and talk me down a bit. If not, I hope you can join me along for the ride.

The stock isn’t on the major exchanges yet, but the ticker is BHSC.CN for Canada and CNVCF for the US if you want to check it out._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Is buying Disney short term basically printing money in the long term? So I’m new to this investing thing and just was wondering if it would be smart to be buying as much Disney as possible right now while it’s relatively lower as it is suffering from covid on its parks side. However with 2021 comes a covid vaccine as well as only 4 weeks where there is no new marvel cinematic material driving Disney+ into millions of homes potentially. That isn’t even talking about the Star Wars extended universe that is being developed bringing with it more shows, subscribers, toys, and theme park attractions. So is buying Disney now and potentially sitting on that short term loss for around 6 more weeks until Falcon and Winter Soldier starts on Disney+ which is about when I expect to see Disney+ get a huge uptick in subs as people realize they can get 2 seasons of mando, Wandavision, and the new captain America. They will also realize they HAVE to have a Disney+ account to follow along with the MCU now. 

AMC is in the same boat as well all be it a little more defined and tied to the vaccine coming out this spring in force._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_
