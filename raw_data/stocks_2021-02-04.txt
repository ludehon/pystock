 What happened to $TCEHY in after hours? The stock went up 1.7% today and then in after hours it's down 6.3% with no new news that I've seen. It was a sudden drop and hasn't moved since so it likely isn't a large sell off, but it is still odd to see it drop significantly and suddenly at once and then not move_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Looking for clarification Ok, so I have wanted to get into the stock market in some respect for a while now. One thing that I have not been able to get a concrete answer on is if there is anything bad about placing an order a certain way. I guess I could parce this into two questions.

1:I want to buy a stock, but I don't want to pay over x amount. If I place a limit buy order for said stock with the limit set ABOVE what the stock is currently being sold for, is there any negative to that, or would my order just immediately go through? (Assuming the exchange is open)

2: The reason I want to buy in the way I described was to avoid sudden jumps in price, as I am starting out with just what I can afford, which isn't too much right now.(I know major jumps aren't too common, but...) Am I being too paranoid and or not seeing something in the information I have read that would make that a bad idea?

Thank you in advance for the help!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ “Can’t lose money if I don’t sell” myth explained I want to welcome all the members who have joined over the past week. Many of you have come from wsb, and I am seeing multiple occasions where people have regretted the losses they took last week and have expressed a desire to learn investing fundamentals.

That’s great! I plan to put together a “fundamentals” guide at some point, but I have not yet had the chance. In the meantime, though, I want to point out the flawed reasoning behind a common sentiment over at wsb, one that may apply to some of our newcomers:

”Technically, if I don’t sell, I haven’t lost.”

The point people are trying to make is that you only *realize* a loss on a position if you sell your stock. For example, if I’ve purchased a stock at, say, $400, and now that stock is down to, I don’t know, $50, then *technically* I haven’t lost anything yet because I still own the share.

This is incorrect reasoning. To explain why, you have to consider the notion of **opportunity cost**, which is essentially the cost of *not* choosing an alternate option. So let’s say I have two investing options: option A and option B. Option A will pay me 12% return, option B will pay me 10% return. I went with option B. In this case, my opportunity cost is 2%, or the additional return I *would have* made by going with option A.

If we return to our example of the $400 stock that is now trading at $50, then sure, on the one hand, we have not sold our share and so we have not realized any actual loss. But that’s not the end of the story. You also have to account for the *opportunity cost* of holding on to a $50 asset when that $50  could otherwise be reinvested.

Say you hold your share and it stays at $50 for the remainder of the year (perhaps in the best case scenario). By holding, you not only have lost 87% thus far on the initial trade, but you’ve also cost yourself the potential gain of putting that $50 into a safe investment (like an index fund), which likely will have a modest 8% gain on the year. That 8% gain is the *opportunity cost* of holding.

In short, no, there **is** a cost even when you do not sell.

(This is not financial advice, I just want to explain a concept.)

\*\*\*

**Edit**: I’ve received lots of encouraging messages from people who really are interested in the fundamentals guide I mentioned above, and I will definitely put that together for you. I’ve also received some, uh, not so encouraging messages from people who assume I’m telling everyone to sell.

Let me clarify: as I’ve said elsewhere in the comments, the concept of opportunity cost does not necessarily mean that every position that is currently down should be sold. Why? Because if you can reasonably expect that your current position will have a better return than those alternative options, then there is no opportunity cost. If you are down 4%, but expect a bounce back and, eventually, a 12% return overall, then the 10% return on an alternative position does not present a cost to you.

If you expect your $50 stock to return to $1000+, then chances are that you won’t have any better opportunities available than a 150%+ return (assuming you bought at $400 and are currently at $50, then $400 is your break even point. $1000 would represent a 150% return on $400).

It is important, however, to consider the *likelihood* of each of these outcomes. That is, how likely is it that you’ll see a 1900% increase on your current position ($50 -> $1000) versus how likely is it that you’ll see an x% return on another opportunity? I’m not telling you what to think here, but that is the question everyone has to ask with every investment.

My purpose was merely to correct for the claim that there is no cost to holding at a loss. There is, assuming that other opportunities can reasonably be said to offer gains over and above what you can expect from your current position._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Gold mining stocks, cheap purchases, or will they remain in a bear market? If you bought gold miner ETFs such as GDX or GDXJ from their inception in 2006 and reinvested dividends, you would still be sitting at a negative even though the price of gold itself has nearly tripled since then. Gold mining stocks haven't done particularly well either for the last half year even though all other commodity related companies continue rallying.

**2) CFO sold all of his shares, and some other executives sold as well**

* People often don’t understand executive comp and how they think. Jack and Jill have expensive private school and your wife's been eyeing that new bag. Equity is a big part of your comp, and sometimes you neeed to liquidate that comp b/c b/c Hermes doesn't taken $BB as legal tender (though they should if you ask me. ).

In otherwords, **Steve didn't sell all his exposure** to Blackberry - He sold the shares **he had in hand**, and from his perspective a significant part of his personal "net worth" is still exposed to equity comp from the Company that will vest and be earned over time. ***In the investing world, that's called skin in the game.***

* A bunch of flightly monkeys jump back onto $BB train which in the short term creates a rally but exacerbate volatility and continues to reinforce the notion that $BB is a meme stock.

Am I the only one? Few questions First of all, I'm not entirely sure if posts like this are appreciated within this sub reddit, I apologize if not. 

So to cut a long story short; I'm mid 20s and was never really about saving money. I just spend it how I wanted. If I look at my friends they never really saved a lot of money either, I don't know if that's a generation thing but whenever I speak to older people (incl my parents). They can't stress enough how important setting money aside is and that they started doing so from a young age onwards. I'm well aware that setting money aside is always a good thing to do, I just could never really find the motivation to do so. Except for when I planned to buy something big in the near future, such as my car/vacations). Been working since 18 never had any money problems whatsoever I make a decent living as a long haul trucker, whilst I'm still young and can put these kind of hours in I really should start caring more about setting money aside for later. If anything ever breaks down like a washing machine I could buy a new one instantly at all times, so to a certain point I do ''save'' money. Just by far not enough I think.

However, years ago I was already really interested in the market (Reading The big short in 2012 started it) but came to the conclusion that it was too hard to understand for me and I shouldn't step into it without knowing what I was doing. I still feel that way although I have a better understanding of it now.

I'm not in this with the illusion to become rich, make it my career or any of that. I just want to start setting money aside and I feel like this way it keeps it interesting for me and motivates me to put any money I have left over for that month, for example, to put into my trading account. 

The question I do have however is; Would it be a ''wise'' decision for me to start saving money by putting it into my trading account? And what is the best market for me to focus on, should I focus on big players like MSFT/AAPL/AMZN? I'm not asking for you to literally tell me where to put my money in. But perhaps you could guide me in the right way, I really don't mind taking long positions as in the end I'm only doing this to start myself off setting money aside and be more careful spending money in general (Read; don't spend it on a whole bunch of dumb/unnecessarily stuff). 

Or would I be better of putting my money in a mutual fund/my savings account?

Right now, Activision is having its quarterly earnings call. Reports are saying $3.05 billion versus $2.78 billion expected, and earnings per share: $1.21 versus $1.17 expected:

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/activision-blizzard-q4-earnings-2020-210514360.html

I don’t own any at the moment, but I wish I had made a major investment. I had been filtering stocks, and a few stats about Activision stuck out to me. Activision has:

* Over 70% gross profit margin
* Over 30% growth in earnings per share this quarter
* Over 30% growth in sales this quarter
* Positive sales growth over past five years
* P/E under 40

Only five other large cap stocks share these characteristics:

* Alexandria Real Estate - ARE
* Facebook - FB			
* Horizon Therapeutics - HZNP
* KKR & Co. - KKR
* Vertex Pharma - VRTX			

Every other stock with those growth, sales, and margin numbers are stocks with insanely high P/E ratios, like Etsy (123) or NovoCure (2486 lol). But you’ve got this group of stocks with what looks like value P/E ratios under 40: Activision, Facebook, two medical tech companies, and two financial companies. And all of them are generally regarded as strong buys. 

But there’s something unique in my mind about Activision. Biotech is volatile, prone to setbacks on a technical or regulatory level even before you start talking business fundamentals. And I know the finance companies are good buys. But Activision’s business model seems more insulated from the some of the pitfalls of the market. It was a strong COVID business and not one that I personally see taking a post-COVID recovery hit. 

This is one of those rare companies where the numbers looks fantastic, I’m familiar with the industry, and I like the company’s products. I’ll probably get invested soon. Just going to wait to see how its price responds to the earnings call. I'd be very interested to hear what others think._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ MYT (Urban Tea) is greatly undervalued Hello Everyone,

Then, I will start my work day then 5pm my kids chores and then dinner then just sleep with drained energy. Same going since year long.

Thanks._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ FUBO: I’m having deja vu, in a good way One of the biggest investing mistakes of my life was not holding my thousand or so Roku shares I got back when it was less than 30 per share and somewhere around the $5 billion market cap area (my biggest mistake twas not holding Enphase at 7 but that’s a different story). $5 billion seemed expensive for a company like Roku and I was reminded of that constantly online. But there were still plenty of bulls and I did my research before buying, so I decided I would make it by biggest individual stock holding. But then it dipped, and being a relatively new investor at the time I was still very finicky. So I sold. At the time many people started talking about how it was a crowded field and there would be no way for them to make money and they couldn’t compete with other big names etc. etc. Go back and look at Seeking Alpha and Reddit comments about Roku from 2018 and you’ll see the negative chitter chatter. Well...just a couple short years later it’s now over 400/share with a market cap of 50 billion. It’s one of those that makes me proud that I saw the opportunity when I did but also makes me sick to look at. 

I see something similar brewing here, with a lot of uninformed folks talking about how Fubo is “no different than cable” due to the price (yeah try to pay for cable sports packages with all Fubos channels and see if that stays under $60, not to mention the ability to watch any shows aired in the last 72 hours), how they’d be screwed if someone else offered the same at a lower price, if they lost their rights to certain channels, etc etc.  Even some of the little similarities are funny, like “Roku TVs” becoming a thing, and now Fubo buttons are being added to Hisense TV remotes.  But I digress...of course they aren’t perfect yet and there are always risks but this time...I’m holding on. As long as subscribers keep increasing, positive reviews on app stores roll in, and they continue improving in general, why not? 

I’m not a financial advisor and not guaranteeing anything, but this is my input for what it’s worth._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Risking 3% of total capital per trade? I’ve been doing some reading before even making a trade as a relative noob, and have noticed in a few of these books (ex: New Trader, Rich Trader) that it’s often suggested that you only want to risk something like 3% of your total capital on a trade.  

So I thought to myself, “Simple enough, I’ll just set a stoploss after buying accordingly.”  Then I realized that it just doesn’t seem to work when back testing due to the stoploss trigger being so easily set off.

For example, say you had $1000 in total capital and used it all to buy a stock at $10 a share, giving you 100 shares.  3% of your total capital is 30 bucks, therefore $30/100 shares would result in your stock only having the ability to drop .30 cents in order to have a total loss of $30.  If my math is right, not surprised if it’s wrong, .30 cents of 100 is only like .3%, which is miniscule compared to the percentage movements that a stock can fluctuate in a day.  

I redid my math using larger amounts of capital, but still came to the same conclusions with a 10 dollar stock.  So, basically, it seems that to set any sort of sensible stoploss to avoid unnecessary triggering, that you would undoubtedly have to risk more than 3% of your total capital.  But if I did this, say risking 10% at a time, then 5 losing trades would severely cripple me, would it not? What am I doing wrong or how is my thinking off?

Someone mentioned this to me in a different question I had yesterday, I’m just struggling to totally understand it._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ How much of your portfolio are you okay investing in risky, speculative plays? Context on why I ask this question. 

I put money on GameStop last week. Fortunately, I didn’t go all in. I put what I was *okay losing*. Though that did not make the feeling any better. 

This last week has burned me out so much that it’s the first time since I started investing (Just recently started August 2020 – although I did have some shares in 2019 but got serious in August) where I want to take a break from it all for a bit. 

What bothers me the most about this loss is seeing the gains I’ve made evaporate. Since August I had made 40% which accounts to about 5 Thousand dollars. All that was lost on GME. It felt nice seeing in RH (will switch soon) that % increase. Now every time I log in, I see that I’m actually down 5-8% in that same time. It feels like all the DD I’ve done; all the time spent the last few months has all been undone by one decision. 

It’s all mental. From an economic standpoint, this does not affect me in the slightest. I have a lot of other ventures, and I have to pay a lot of taxes on those other investments at the end of the year since it’s not automatically deducted, this loss can help as a tax deduction which is why I’ll hold till the end of the year. That being said, I HATE LOSING MONEY, and the amount I lost relative to the amount in my portfolio, I feel was a bit too high! 

At that moment I currently had 22,000 in my portfolio. Lost 5 on GME since I purchased in the upper 300’s. I invested 25% of my portfolio and looking back it was a lot more than I should have.   

Which is where the question comes in. How much of your portfolio are you okay investing in risky, speculative plays? I don’t think I’ll ever go above 10% again, probably 5%._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Question on Interlisted Stocks I was poking around and trying to do some research on things (newb here, but trying lol), and I had a question I wasn't sure on.

CSE: TNY

OTC: TNYBF

The TLDR:  Tinley is a combination US & Canadian cannabis beverage play, while simultaneously attacking the zero alcohol category with the same drink minus the THC.  On top of their own brands, Tinley is securing revenue at their industry leading California bottling facility using it as a platform for other companies that want to tap into the THC beverage market.  Tinleys is an acquisition target for big alcohol or bigger THC companies looking to get into beverages.  Valued at only $50M, there is a lot of room to grow considering the exit valuations of other successful startup beverage brands, and existing THC beverage partnerships.

Why Beverages?

* Raw leaf is a commodity that when competition increases usually ends up with profit margins racing to the bottom.  Final products like beverages hold brand value which allow them to maintain high profit margins.  Humans consume beverages socially, and the fact that thc has a similar effect as alcohol but without the calories or hangover, it is very likely to replace a decent % of the alcohol industry, especially for people who have to go in to work the next morning.

On their leadership team, Tinley has a lineup of former executives from massively successful brands. Their roster is deeper than your wife’s boyfriend’s favourite sports team.

**Tinley’s THC line:**

They are now licensed to [bottle & sell THC beverages in California](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/07/02/2056890/0/en/Tinley-s-Long-Beach-Facility-Receives-Cannabis-Manufacturing-License.html?fbclid=IwAR0IKVpZKV3irhZNwA9sFkSW85r9swPM2a5iPJo9VzBesRo0gnHqr6cNHa0), and have already applied to Health Canada for their license to do the same in Canada.  They also have plans to expand to Nevada in the medium term.

The drinks have [great reviews](https://growthbuster.com/blogs/liftoff/we-tried-8-non-alcoholic-cocktails-for-dry-january-here-s-what-happened?utm_campaign=later-linkinbio-growthbuster&utm_content=later-13990246&utm_medium=social&utm_source=instagram&fbclid=IwAR39Fb_lgTw99jysHAlabF-vEIOX9i1_RMP_Twob7vbKdIKCKA-sBuPrZBU), and apparently taste amazing, having [already won awards](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2019/12/17/1961810/0/en/Tinley-Takes-Top-Two-Infused-Beverage-Prizes-at-Emerald-Cup.html).

They use a Sativa strain which supposedly gives you a more uplifting euphoric feeling, rather than a glued-to-the-couch feeling.  I haven’t tried it myself, but the reviews online all seem positive.

Without speculating why, research suggests that people are moving away from alcohol over time.  On the other hand, cannabis use grows & many experts believe that THC beverages will make up a large % of the total Cannabis market share.

“Molson president and CEO Mark Hunter told analysts that although it's difficult to provide a number because cannabis beverages were illegal at the time, he believed the total cannabis market in Canada to be about $7 billion to $10 billion in size, with beverages accounting for anywhere from 20% to 30% of the total, or as much as $3 billion. Even on the low end that's a $1.5 billion opportunity.”

Big companies have already made bets on this, like [Constellation Brands taking a 4 Billion stake in Canopy Growth Corp](https://www.beveragedaily.com/Article/2020/05/05/Constellation-Brands-increases-stake-in-Canopy-Growth-Corp#:~:text=Constellation%20Brands%20has%20increased%20its,Canopy%20Growth%20Corp%20to%2038.6%25.) to develop THC beverages and [Molson Coors starting a joint venture with Hexo.](https://mjbizdaily.com/hexo-molson-coors-launch-truss-cannabis-beverage-portfolio/) [AB InBev & Tilray invested $100 million Joint Venture into THC beverages](https://www.fooddive.com/news/ab-inbev-and-tilray-invest-100m-to-study-cannabis-based-drinks/544836/) creating the Fluent Beverage Company.

**Tinley’s non-infused non-alcoholic Beckett’s line:**

Their non-infused, non-alcoholic brand “Becketts” is currently in the trial phase in Costco, BevMo, Ralphs & Kroger, which appears to be going well as they have made reorders.  Though it’s essentially the same taste as their THC beverage, they treat their Beckett’s brand as a separate entity to avoid the red tape associated with the THC line.  They are essentially attacking two growing categories at once with essentially the same drink, which also gives cross-brand awareness & additional revenue.

Beckett’s has recently partnered with [Todd Chrisley](https://www.instagram.com/toddchrisley/), the patriarch of the Chrisley Family with an audience of over 2M instagram followers who has the successful reality television show “Chrisley Knows Best” that also has an audience of 2M.

I don’t really have a lot to say about Becketts, as I don’t know a lot about the non-alcohol industry other than according to data it is a growing industry.  I don’t really care about it that much either, because to me Beckett’s is just a cherry on top - this beverage line is literally just duplicating their THC beverages and taking out the THC and calling it a product.  It seems like a smart move to increase their revenue without reinventing the wheel.  A lot of other Tinley investors seem to think it will be a short term catalyst for the SP as it gets carried in more and more mainstream store locations.

**Co-packing deals:**

Their bottling facility allows for a multitude of different styles of beverages & different concentrations of THC.  From single serve bottles, to mini-shots, to multi-serve bottles, carbonated or not carbonated, and with a variety of different flavors.

They announced late last year that they already have at least 12 co-packing clients, 2 of which they have just press released, with 10 more to come in short order.  This means that investing now is a great time to take advantage of the information disparity before their blockbuster deals get announced.

There’s rumors the CEO has already rejected offers to acquire the company, but the way the company is set up to allow other brands to use them like a turn-key beverage platform is screaming for some whale to come in and buy them out at a premium.  This licensing process takes years, and Tinley is among the first-movers.  For example, Molson & Hexo announced Truss Beverages in 2018, but they only received their license to produce THC beverages at their belleville facility in 2020.

Currently Tinley’s has no debt, and is positioned well in the THC bev space to act on both  Canadian and US markets.

But the company provided a first-quarter adjusted EBITDA forecast that was much lower than analysts' consensus expectations.

Additionally, Snap warned that Apple's privacy changes in iOS 14, which are expected to take effect late in the first quarter, "present another risk of interruption to demand."

(Bloomberg) -- Pinterest Inc. reported quarterly sales that topped analysts’ estimates on a holiday shopping season that started earlier than expected and drove advertisers online due to the coronavirus. Shares gained about 8% in extended trading after the results were announced.

Fourth-quarter revenue jumped 76% to $706 million, the San Francisco-based digital scrapbooking and search company said Thursday in a statement. That was better than analysts’ average projection of $646 million, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

While the Covid-19 pandemic continues to force Pinterest to “navigate uncertainty,” the company estimated revenue will increase in the “low-70% range” in the period ending in March. That would top analysts’ projections of about a 60% revenue gain. Pinterest said it would provide further details on its outlook during a conference call to discuss the results.

Pinterest has seen its advertising business grow steadily in recent months as advertisers turned to the internet due to the pandemic. The company said it experienced good turnout from small- and medium-sized businesses in the fourth quarter, including in categories like consumer-packaged goods and retail.

The company said it has 459 million monthly users, up 37% from a year earlier. Analysts, on average, estimated about 448 million users.

Profit, excluding some items, was 43 cents a share, topping the average estimate of 33 cents.

Pinterest shares reached a high of $88.38 in extended trading after closing at $77.84 in New York. The stock has gained about 18% this year after more than tripling in 2020._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ What do you guys think about Pinterest Stock ?

Honestly don't think its market manipulation like what WSB claims (i.e short ladder attacks).

So they rode the BB/AMC/NOK/GME wave, and then pulled out leaving retail as the bag holders.

But unlike AMC, NOK and GME, BB finally broke out of the correlation, and traded upward today. Which is a good sign and maybe due to the common sentiment that it's very undervalued and potentially has a very bright future with the IoT and EV market.

Fidelity Research gives it an average analyst score rating of 8.9/10 (9-10 is in the very bullish range), with the most notable analyst being Zacks Ranking. Seeking Alpha seems to place it at a fair value price of around $15-17. It's now around $12. Let's see how this plays out.

Thoughts?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ APD and earnings report I have been following APD and been invested for about 8 months now. I believe this stock is very fairly valued at the moment and this provides a good entry point since they missed on earnings. They have a lot of new facilities opening soon and the lag in earnings they claim is "covid related." 

With the sell off today, i am wondering what others think about this stock. I think with their green hydrogen initiative it still seems like a safe bet for the long term. It's definitely a boring stock, but I really like the management. I am however, very worried because they could not give guidance for future earnings (due to covid) and said they would update in April if possible. 

I am definitely a little concerned for the short term with this stock, but I look at their past growth and definitely have faith in their management team.

She said there are only a few companies that handle the majority of equipment used in these labs.

One she mentioned was Thermo Fisher. 

Here's their business summary from Schwab:

> Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. develops, manufactures and sells a range of products. The Company operates through four segments: Life Sciences Solutions, Analytical Instruments, Specialty Diagnostics, and Laboratory Products and Services. It offers its products and services through various brands, including Thermo Scientific, Applied Biosystems, Invitrogen, Fisher Scientific and Unity Lab Services. 

> * Life Sciences Solutions segment provides a portfolio of reagents, instruments and consumables used in biological and medical research, discovery and production of new drugs and vaccines. 
> * Analytical Instruments segment provides a broad offering of instruments, consumables, software and services that are used for a range of applications in the laboratory. 
> * Specialty Diagnostics segment offers a wide range of diagnostic test kits, reagents, culture media, instruments and associated products. 
> * Its Laboratory Products and Services segment offers products and solutions needed for the laboratory.

With the surge of genetic focused research, I was thinking TMO might be in a really good position for some future growth if more labs open that focus on DNA / genetics / genomic research.

If you don't want to try to pick and choose which genetic companies are going to succeed and you already own ARKG, Thermo Fisher might be another worth looking into.

The share price might be considered a high entry point for a lot of people (~$490 today), but it's been a solid growth stock for me.  It does have a dividend, although it's laughably small (0.18% annual dividend yield).

This is also a huge blow to the Alaskan economy , which is where I currently live..I linked the article below

So as the title states I am thinking of selling off one of the above ETFs that I have to invest in MSOS. As it stands, ICLN is about 50% of my portfolio, with QCLN, TAN, and ARKG equally divided among the rest, however, ICLN has been performing the worst out of the three. I definitely want to keep all of ARKG as I really like that ETF's potential.

I am really interested in MSOS and what it could become and was wondering what my best play might be here as far as my other ETFs go? This is NOT in an IRA or Roth IRA FYI._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ why would there be 2 ticker symbols for the same company? Hey guys, i'm a bit confused as i'm still fairly new to investing. There is company called Holicity inc that has merged with a space company called Astra making it the first publicly traded space launch company(via merger of course). But they have 2 ticker symbols. Hol and Holuu. why would that be?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ What sectors would a diversified portfolio consist of? So I've been reading and listening to podcasts for last couple of years and I have started to invest for my future.

I have some money on ETFs and I have about an equal amount in the stock market.

The ETFs are focused on robotics, one's an ESG, and a couple others focus on technology (one focused on Asia one US)
But basically I am wondering if anyone could suggest a couple sectors which would be wise to look at. Since I keep finding myself looking at pharmaceutical and tech based companies for stock I don't think my stock portfolio is very diverse.

Thanks in advance and sorry if this has been brought up before._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Best ETFs or mutual funds for someone with $500? Hey all! I was one of the many who bought into the GME/AMC hype and ended up losing because of it. I lost around 2k (as a 21 year old college student, around 20% of my savings). This is nothing for many of you and won't be a life ruining event for me, but it definitely taught me some important lessons. 

I want to actually be smart with investing and I plan on making that loss up over time by being a smart long-term investor. I salvaged around 1k of what I had initially put in, and I plan on using half of that for this. I think ETFs are probably a much safer way to get started and to slowly make my money back. What funds would you all suggest? Would you suggest any other kinds of investments?  Thank you for the input!

EDIT: Thanks for the comments! Decided to go with 2 in ARKK, 3 in ICLN, 4 in YOLO, and 2 in JETS. Here's to not looking at this account for a year and seeing where it goes!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Decided to focus my investments this year to three sectors After all this craziness with meme stocks lately,  I decided to limit my investments to just three sectors and build a portfolio of stocks from these areas.

I will be keeping myself busy with researching AI, biotechnology, and nanotechnology. 
Any thoughts?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Anyone investing in THMO stock? I’ve been looking at the stock over a long period of time and think it might be good to invest because of the change in presidency. Based on their recent launch of automated manufacturing techniques for cells I think they might boost back from $3 per share to maybe $50, which is at the same level it was at before the trump presidency. Wanted to know what the community thought about purchasing this?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Ever hear of street lag? There’s a very interesting phenomenon in the stock market and it’s called street lag. 

What is it?

Street lag is whenever a stock is yet to be well known on stock markets, big news outlets, because usually the time that they are... you’re far beyond too late for the bargain deal. 

Ideally, your growth stock picks aren’t very well known or talked about. This can lead to picking up shares at a much lower price that it would/will be whenever Wall Street picks up and more often than not leads to much greater value increases relative to what you bought it at._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Government Initiates EV Acquisition It appears the Administration is actively pursuing the transition of its motor vehicle fleet to battery electric vehicles and fuel-cell electric vehicles.

It's quite a lengthy one, please bare with me as you read and this is the first time I looked up regarding a company at this depth.

Some background on the John Chen, who took up a massive challenge when he was the CEO for Sybase where the stock price was around 4-5$. But when he sold off to SAP it was around 65$, although it took 10 years to accomplish. He understands the business quite well and knows where to focus to generate more revenue and certainly be the best in what they do and provide the best to their customers.

The Company’s goal is to remain a leader in regulated industries and other core verticals by continuing to extend the functionality of its secure BlackBerry Spark® software platform (UEM + UES).

# How does the EV Sector Exponential Growth help BB?

Well, the 2020 to 2022 is a period for gaining significant momentum in the Smart EV sector and which shall rapidly accelerate from 2023 to 2025. As we are noticing multiple companies in EV sector trying to launch their products.

Most of the companies would love to be part of the growing EV sector as it just the beginning excluding TESLA. They will eventually develop products/platforms for OEM's and Tier1 and provide it as a service.

As EV sector evolves more, we should see more partnerships across other companies which aren't part of BB yet might be inclined to use at least one product. As the BB product offerings are diverse and the customer success stories about how they have played a role while manufacturing their own EV products with minimal efforts can boost the marketing efforts.

Chen stated they are going after the other 6 OEM's which aren't using the Blackberry yet. Currently, BlackBerry QNX has design wins with 19 of top 25 Electric Vehicle OEMs, who together have 61% of EV market.

# How is BB coping up during the COVID?

The company expects BlackBerry QNX revenue to be negatively impacted by a slowdown in automotive market related to the COVID-19 pandemic, the impact of which could be partially offset by increased customer demand for the Company’s endpoint security and productivity solutions that support business continuity and remote working environments, including the BlackBerry Spark platform, SecuSUITE and BlackBerry AtHoc.

# What's upcoming and where is BB focusing strategically?

The Company is developing a concept system to integrate BlackBerry Spark capabilities, including AI and machine learning technologies, with BlackBerry QNX automotive solutions. How to watch out for more information during the earnings calls.

# How was the Customers growth among BB products?

**QNX:**

QNX was acquired by BB in 2010, right from that moment, BB started its journey in Automotive industry. Initially, it has launched Infotainments and Telematic under QNX product category and it was deployed on leading car manufacturers. It started branching out and was able to offer more products under QNX. Now it is has aligned itself very well for the next gen EV cars.

Adoption of QNX products from 2016 to 2020:

* 2016 - 50 Million
* 2017 - 60 Million
* 2018 - 120 Million
* 2019 - 150 Million
* 2020 - 175 Million

As we see, the growth has been substantial, and we can expect it grow more as we see more cars from new manufacturers and from existing ones and also automotive driving platforms especially in EV sector. There are currently 1.4 billion cars approximately.  In 2018, approximately 4.2 million heavy commercial vehicles and just over 20 million light commercial vehicles were produced throughout the world.

It’s estimated to have at least 470 million cars by 2025.

>Under the terms of our agreement, BlackBerry will own all the commercial relationships with customers and will share revenues with AWS.  
>  
>The target is to be in the 2023 year’s auto model, with possibly potentially some professional services prior to it. While it is too early for us to provide a revenue outlook, we are confident that BlackBerry IVY addresses a very large market opportunity that will greatly increase our ASP.

# BB Revenue:

Check the Spreadsheet for the Revenue Sources.

[2021 Fiscal year](https://imgur.com/pFnGMId)

Note: Software and Services include these products IoT, QNX, BlackBerry Spark, AtHoc, Radar.

The revenue got impacted due to 2020 chaos especially on the QNX product side. According to the earning calls. There are still on track to maintain the gross margin over 70% and dollar net retention rate is above 90%.

As you see, the [gross margin](https://imgur.com/Qf6fp2n) has been consistent past few years and revenue is steadily increasing every year.

[Growth in Revenue from Products from 2019-2013](https://imgur.com/ODRyRZY)

Notes:

In 2019, due to restructuring, BB was unable to close deals, we should see +ve in 2020.

IoT: Comprised of QNX products, UEM, & Radar

Other: Handheld Devices and Service Access Fee (SAF)

Since BB was moving away from manufacturing of devices gradually, in 2020 most of it done by third party companies. That’s why we have negative growth under **Other.**

# Pricing for BB products

**QNX Pricing:**

As there are many modules under QNX, like hypervisor, ADAS, clusters, cockpit, IVI. The cost ranges anywhere from the low-single digit dollars to literally high-single digit or low-double digit dollars per module.

Trefis estimates BlackBerry generates about $4 in QNX revenue per vehicle. Automakers are only expected to ship about 62 million new vehicles this year, according to Statista Research. Assuming QNX is installed on at least half of those vehicles, BlackBerry would generate about $120 million in annual sales -- or nearly a fifth of its trailing 12-month software and services revenue -- from QNX this year.

Link: [https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/12/07/investors-overreacting-blackberry-deal-with-amazon/](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/12/07/investors-overreacting-blackberry-deal-with-amazon/)

Unfortunately, we don't know the exact price the QNX OS costs or per say other modules under QNX. If more modules of QNX are used, then it's adds up and the Average Rate for Per Unit might be 4x or 5x.

This gives us an idea about how to get more revenue from QNX itself when the manufacturer would use other modules under QNX apart from OS.

We have already seen list of the OEM's from previous posts and in the below spreadsheet you shall see list of the QNX products certain OEM's are using

IoT subscription period is typically 4 yrs.

**Radar Pricing:**

Estimation in 2017:

BlackBerry charges $10 to $20 per month for every trailer connected to Radar.

The Go-to-Market objective is to have approximately a 50-50 split in Radar sales between BlackBerry’s channel partners and its direct sales force. BlackBerry Radar partners typically sell only this particular solution.

Recently, BB was able to expand channel ecosystem to more than 12 channel partners, this new partnership might help BB capture more of the logistics and transportation area.

**Cylance Pricing:**

Cylance might charge 55$ per endpoint per year.

Announced that Forrester found that BlackBerry Cylance’s AI-driven endpoint security products delivered a 99 percent return on investment. We will see more revenue in 2021 as we shared earlier that customers who bought UEM are excited about UES too.

At present, the market share is below 1%.

**Projected Product Sector Revenue Growth by 2025:**

**QNX:**

According to survey, the Global In-Vehicle Infotainment Market size is expected to reach $42.7 billion by 2025 (This is where we shall see more competition from different OEM manufacturers as they build their own products)

Global Market Insights, Inc. has recently added a new report on automotive operating system market which estimates the global market valuation for automotive OS will cross US$ 4.5 billion by 2026

And the QNX OS (Just the OS) segment is expected to grow at a CAGR of nearly 15% from 2020 to 2026

[https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/11/24/2132346/0/en/Automotive-OS-Market-to-hit-USD-4-5-Bn-by-2026-Global-Market-Insights-Inc.html](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/11/24/2132346/0/en/Automotive-OS-Market-to-hit-USD-4-5-Bn-by-2026-Global-Market-Insights-Inc.html)

**Endpoint Protection (Cylance):**

The global endpoint security market is expected to grow from 13.58 billion $ in 2020 to 19.24 billion $ in 2025 at a CAGR of 7.6% during the forecast period.

[https://www.marketdataforecast.com/market-reports/endpoint-security-market](https://www.marketdataforecast.com/market-reports/endpoint-security-market).

Assuming the market share in endpoint increases to \~3%. It can be around 577 million

**Asset Management (Radar):**

Global asset tracking market will reach $36.3B by 2025, growing at 15% CAGR

[https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/03/04/1995009/0/en/Global-Asset-Tracking-Market-2020-2025-Insights-Into-Technologies-Solutions-and-the-Ecosystem-Including-Major-Players.html](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/03/04/1995009/0/en/Global-Asset-Tracking-Market-2020-2025-Insights-Into-Technologies-Solutions-and-the-Ecosystem-Including-Major-Players.html)

We have to know what the priority level for BB for this product and how much market share they are targeting in the upcoming years. It’s quite early to say about it and the contribution to the revenue is insignificant compared to other products.

**Challenges:**

QNX:

Toyota, VW, Mercedes Benz have started taking route of AGL (Automotive Grade Linux) which is an open source (free to use) which implies the QNX market share in OS is waning. These are big manufacturers and how blackberry shall adapt is wait and see game.

There is always a case where companies might decide not to use more of the QNX modules just the OS, this will impact the Average Selling Price (ASP) per car as well as the revenue since those modules add up 4x-5x ASP.

IVY:

Revenue from Blackberry IVY shall be more reflective from 2023, stated by Chen. So, there is uncertainty in this area and no revenue estimate. We have to see how this partnership plays out how companies are willing to adopt cloud platform for insights and management of the automotive software’s.

Cylance:

Currently, the market is highly competitive, and BB has to make it way to top 10 and capture more market share. In 2021, it shall unfold more about it as we are seeing rapid growth in IoT sector across various sectors.

The BB is in the right position to capture more of the automotive market and we have to see how it shall play out in coming years when EV sector is full blown and more cars are delivered, and security threats increase. Also, it offers the endpoint protection, which certainly companies can benefit but not necessarily the SMB which are driven through e-commerce platforms.

Radar:

It’s barely scratching the surface in this sector and as there are bigger sharks who have been in the market for long time.

In the second quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company previously stated that it expected to generate $100 million in cumulative revenue from its BlackBerry Radar asset tracking solution over the next three years. The Company no longer expects to generate this revenue within this time frame. (This is a set back and there are other competitors who have been in the Logistics and Transportation Industry for quite some time).

In general, BB has to pitch itself more aggressively in other sectors especially in Medical, Industrial, Oil and Energy. Considering the certifications they have and the clients they serve.

Thanks to OP's and go give a read at these DD's too:

Target Price in 2021: 25-30 (by not considering crazy valuations into account). I personally believe if the IVY platform and Spark product revenue increases then we can certainly see the stock price 4x-5x in coming years.

Analysts have a PT of $170-200, depending who you ask, by the end of the year. It dropped almost 10% AH this morning/last night. The reason was they couldn't quite meet demand, so it seems that their demand is incredible, yet beat earnings estimates/revenue. Is it a buy right now? Or will it keep tanking downwards?

Hey all, I'm looking for the best tool to organize and track all the stocks I have in my portfolio. Currently I have most of my holdings in E-trade, but the UI is pretty awful imo. I like the <R-broker who must not be named> UI, and use it primarily for checking price movement on a stock, but I still think it leaves a bit to be desired. Ideally, this is what I would like:

* Some sort of tile view of all the stocks I care about, with current price & colored red/green for the days change.
* The ability to add tags to stocks so I can filter them by different criteria. i.e filter my portfolio to show only "meme stocks".
* Clicking on the tile should take me to a nice graph UI in a new tab.

So far I've not found anything like this, and am thinking if I want it so bad, maybe I should build it myself, but was wondering if y'all knew about something similar to this out there, that might at least hit some of these requirements._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Question about the wash-sale rule Say I purchase 10 shares of stock at $100 each, so $1000 total. I sell all of it for a loss at $50 each. Then the stock plummets to $10 and I buy back in with the $500 I had left over. I now own 50 shares. I understand my original loss of $500 is added to the cost basis of these new shares. Now let's say the stock shoots back up to $30 and I sell all 50 shares for $1500.

Would I incur a tax on the gain of (($30-$10) * 50) = $1000, or the net gain of $500?

This stock could easily crack 3$ by the end of 2021 (almost broke 2CAD$ today). This is a very risky industry with a couple different players in it, but Drone Delivery Canada has already received government approval in Canada, is debt free and has drones with payloads up to 1000lbs with buyers waiting for testing to end.

I’m also thinking of doing some in ARK funds , some in VOO and some in EWEB (emerging markets). What do you think of that approach?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Monthly T-Bill Investment  

I already have $6k in the stock market/other risky investments, with $8k leftover in my savings account, and this is really the ratio I'm most comfortable with; I don't feel too comfortable shelling out much more into risky investments. I'm also still a dependent of my parents, and I don't really have any bills or consistent payments I need to make (except for food when I'm not eating college cafeteria food).

I was thinking since the $8k in my savings account doesn't really have anywhere to be used, letting them sit in the (extremely) low-interest savings account might be a waste since I just don't need that much cash. Would buying a 6-month T-bill every month be a good idea? My intuition is that by buying a 6-month T-bill every month, I would get a much higher but still extremely safe interest rate than the savings account, while maintaining a minimum $2k still in cash (savings account) at all times. Since I'm not willing to take on any more risky investments (I might consider AAA bonds too, but that's another story), does this kind of process make sense?

As for buying the T-bill, I was thinking I would simply get new issues from the Treasury directly (through Ameritrade), since I don't really want to deal with the stress of having to do due diligence with bond pricing calculations in the bond market. I'm still super busy with schoolwork and internship stuff and whatnot.

The CEO sold about 35% of his shares in the last 10 days. Is that something to be concerned about? Or is he paid in stock options so is it not that big of a deal?

Also, I'm checking the short interest on the stock and it is 33.68 MM shares short as of Jan. 15.  That is about 28.8 % of the float and 27.9% of shares outstanding. Did the stock price increase recently due to the shorts covering? Or are they constantly shorting as the stock price goes up?

I am mainly wondering if i should sell covered calls around the 50 dollar strike price. I am comfortable letting go of the stock at that price, but im also concerned if the usps announcement gets delayed again and it goes back down to 30.

I’m fairly new to stocks, and I’ve had my recent eye on Trillium Therapeutics, a leading biotech company for cancer research. I have hopes for them long term, but was wondering if they’d be good for range trading, since in the last 5 days it’s been seeming to follow a pattern. Any advice appreciated!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Question regarding Tilray Aphria merger Okay so Aphria is technically absorbing most of Tilray but keeping the Tilray name. 

Now I own 100 shares of each right now, been in Tilray since $5.55 😎🤑. But from what I can find, for each share of Aphria you have, you will get 0.8381 shares of Tilray. I’m going to round to the nearest $0.50 for ease of math and because obviously the price is constantly changing.

According to my very poor math skills, Aphria is at $16.50 right now and Tilray is at $25.50 (was trading at $27.50 earlier this week which would prove the point even more.) 

So your $16.50 Aphria share turns into 0.83 shares of Tilray, now worth $21.16. 

Unless I am misunderstanding all of this, which is very possible, wouldn’t it make sense to dump my 100 shares of Tilray and just buy Aphria because you’re virtually converting $16.50 to $21.16 per share? 

Obviously this doesn’t account for what the price does after the merger, but I have a hard time believing it’s going to reach $27 or even $25 for a while after the merger._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Is selling puts too good to be true? I'm just learning about options and selling puts seems too good to be true. I feel like I must be missing something.

If I'm already interested in a stock, then why wouldn't I just sell a put at a strike price at around where I think the stock is going to dip? If the contract is executed, then I'll receive 100 shares of that stock plus the premium. If the contract isn't executed then I just get the premium. The only drawback I see here is if the stock plunged after the contract was executed, but I would have lost anyways had I bought the stock outright at the perceived dip. At least by selling a put I was able to soften my mistake with the premium. Do I have this right?

One other question. Couldn't I just sell a put with a strike price that is just above the current price of the stock I'm interested in? Wouldn't it just immediately execute? The reason I ask is because couldn't there be a situation where the strike price multiplied by 100 minus the premium would be less than just buying 100 shares of the stock at its current price?

Besides that, are there any special fees or anything weird? I use TD Ameritrade and according to their site they charge .65 for every contract. That doesn't seem bad..._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ MVMDF – an undiscovered, hyper-growth stock? MVMDF is still very much under the radar, but still has massive growth potential.

Imagine if there was a company that could completely revolutionize the worldwide vaccine distribution and supply chain. And what if that company’s technology in the future was in every single vaccine for humans and animals? There is a company called Mountain Valley MD (Ticker **MVMDF**) that has multiple solutions to speed up the response to the global pandemic and future pandemics. MVMDF claims they can reduce vaccine doses by 95% and still get the same effect. They claim their technology allows vaccines to not have to be shipped in cryo refrigerators like the Pfitzer vaccine making it easier to distribute worldwide. They also claim they have a solubilized version of a common drug that can treat positively tested Covid patients within 48 hours. 

Ivermectin is an FDA approved drug that is very effective in clearing the body of parasites. It has been dosed to humans over 2 billion times primarily in Africa and has been proven to be very safe for human use. It is also used as a de-wormer for pets. It is a very inexpensive and widely available drug, but it has very poor solubility, meaning it can be difficult to absorb. Only in the last 9 months this drug was discovered to have very potent anti-viral properties. For it to be used in antiviral applications the body needs to have a high circulating amount, and because it has poor solubility, this is an issue. Promising studies have shown very good results in fighting Covid-19, however this is with doses 100x of what is FDA approved for human use. This is where Mountain Valley MD comes in. Using their patented Quicksome and Quicksol technology they have created solubilized ivermectin which increases the bioavailability of the drug in the human body. They have shown a 500-800% increase in bioavailability using their technology meaning they would need a fraction of a dose to get the same effect. Their Quicksome and Quicksol technologies have wide ranging applications.

Later this month their technology will be tested in a BSL-4 Lab. Less than 30 BSL-4 labs are available throughout the world and they often require 3 years to schedule a study in one of these labs. After MVMD presented pre-clinical data and results, they were pushed to the front of the line for the BSL-4 lab at Tulane University. They will begin their trial this month, and are expecting results in April. What they are hoping to prove is that their solubilized ivermectin will completely clear the viral load of Covid-19 within 2 days. Treatment can be given with a shot or they also produce rapid dissolve oral wafers that can be distributed to the public.  Vaccines are just one tool we have to fight viruses, and as we have seen with Covid, vaccines can take months or years to develop giving viruses time to spread and mutate. What a vaccine doesn’t do is treat someone who is already infected with Covid-19. Their CEO says they have zero doubt that within 1 hour of taking one of these wafers your body will begin to resist the spread of a virus. With future viruses this drug will be an important tool in attacking a virus from the very beginning to contain an outbreak giving us time to develop a vaccine if needed.  

The solubilized ivermectin is only one thing MVMDF is tackling. They are currently working at improving the supply chain and distribution of vaccines. They have a patented dose sparing adjuvant known as PANA that reduces a vaccine dosage 95% that will also be tested at the BSL-4 lab. A vaccine with this technology is very stable and does not require cryo refrigeration like many current vaccines. They are also studying different ways of administering a vaccine where the shot is only a few microns below the skin instead of the blood stream. They believe their adjuvant with new methods of administering shots could reduce dosage much greater than the 95% they are already achieving. 

Their technology should be able to be licensed for use with many other pharmaceutical drugs.

TLDR

* Promising COVID-19 treatment with accredited results anticipated by April 2021
* Involved in Tulane University’s BSL-4 lab study  starting late February
* Second study will test efficacy in eradicating Polio with their drug
   * Also extremely effective in treating other viruses
* Technology to reduce vaccine doses by 95%
* Revolutionizing the vaccine supply without the need for cold-chain distribution
* Billions of dollars lost in current cold-chain inadequacies approximately 30-50 billion
* Big Pharma showing interest in licensing their drug delivery technologies
* MVMDF went public in June 2020 and is valued around 1.35

A controversial topic but I’m starting be under the impression that the future of the S & P is sort of bleak. USD dollar is weakening, and money is pouring to emerging markets. Not to mention we have insane debt, and the FED keeps printing like crazy. Also,  globalism is on the downturn.

Sorry if this doesn’t belong on this sub or it’s own post but I just wanted a place to vent or share my thoughts. I’m 24 years old and pretty financially stable and conservative since I started my job over a year ago. Ive never really made huge investments and have basically saved a decent amount of money since graduating, almost sometimes feeling like I should “use some of the money on things/bigger stocks”. I’ve always been into investing and made small but meaningful gains and never really took a negative on any stocks to date until now. After a pal even asked me about GME early last week, I told him “hell no, way too volatile right now to be playing with it.” Somehow 2 days later, I fell into my own rabbit hole and actually threw a decent amount of money on this around the 250 price. In retrospect, I STILL think I made the right call as this stock had a massive trajectory upwards and had my sell limits set near $500. I firmly believe last Wednesday it was going to smash that before massive halts started. Anyways, I held on afterwards and have fell over -$6,000 and couldn’t take it anymore just seeing it free falling and sold off this morning. I know holding would probably be better, but I couldn’t hear just seeing it plummet. Again, I went in with money that I knew I’d be able to risk and I’m fine right now but just feel kind of upset how this whole situation went. I still have some BB as well but holding that as many others have also pointed out, is a good long term hold. I don’t know, after all this, I’m almost having doubts about myself in the stock market and if I can make good plays again, this kind of destroyed my morale and emotional more than money necessarily. 

Anyways, anyone have similar stories of losses and then having a good comeback story? Are bigger losses like this inevitable for everyone? With tax return season and bonuses coming up, I’m happy to that I’ll be more than able to make up the money but damn it hurts inside._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Getting back your losses Hey guys and gals! I can't seem to figure out if this is worthy or not.

Bought 136 shares @14 (we can round up to say it cost $2000)

Stock plummeted to $7 (-$1000)

Does it make sense to sell @7 (cashing in on your remaining $1000)

Then buy back another 136 shares (which cost you that $1000)

Then trade with small upticks in price until you can eventually make up that $1000 loss. 

OR

Perhaps selling that stock and putting the funds in an already appreciating stock makes more sense...

(I know losing 50% of a stock was a mistake but alas where to go from here?)


Obvious disclaimer: Not financial advice, just inquiring to learn more about gaining back losses. I'm not sure if this is Averaging Down or just hitting the reset button and try to recoup your losses. 



Thanks!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ What is a safe stock that gives high monthly or quarterly dividends? I’m young (24m) and I work full time earning approximately 70k a year before tax. No wife or kids and my living expenses are extremely low as I rent an all inclusive apartment with friends. I’m just getting into investing as I want to diversify income streams. I have some money in government bonds and ETFs that are yielding some nice dividends and it’s given me a taste of what I’ve been missing out on all this time. 

I haven’t gotten into individual stocks very much outside of renewable energy as I thought that was a safe place to start. I’m not looking for anything unrealistic or too good to be true, just a stock that has a steady history of return and that if I were to drop 10-20-30k into it and hold maybe I could see 100$ a month in added net income.

Really appreciate your time._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Learned my Lesson with Buying into the Hype, but Will Still Hold Long Term I bought shares of AMC when it was $10. I could have sold at $20, but chose not to. When purchasing, I chose an amount that I was comfortable with losing, but also an amount that could provide me with significant returns if it went up a lot like everyone thought.

Few things I've learned from this... Don't buy into something just because everyone is doing it. Sounds easy, but evidently for many of us it's not. Whether you want to call it FOMO or peer pressure, you need to understand what you are getting into and the ramifications if it goes south. I bought in because of the hype and I think this has been a good learning moment for me. One of the biggest things I've seen is the fact that there's so much false information going around that it's crazy. I can't count how many posts that say if we hold to this day and keep the price above X amount, it will go to the moon the next day. Truthfully, it seems majority of the people sharing these things know nothing about stocks. I have student loans that need to be paid off. My hope was that I'd be a little closer to paying those off more quickly than previously planned.

I am happy that I didn't purchase GME as I almost did when it was at $300. The great news is that AMC was at $10 for me and I still believe it will go higher than that. I don't think it's going to the moon. But, I do think we can eventually get to $20-$40 in the next few years. Millions of people have been stuck in their homes for about a year now. Once we get past Covid/many have the vaccination, people will go to AMC to watch the movies. There will be many amazing box office movies coming out in the next few years due them being delayed by Covid. So, AMC hasn't popped off like I had hoped for, but there is absolutely no reason to sell right now in my opinion because this is a long term play that can make me some money in the future. 

Who knows... Maybe it will still go to the moon. I'd be thrilled! But, until then I will hold and be excited for the future when going to the movies is a popular thing to do again. 

I'll probably get down voted for this post, but I think this is the truth for many of us here. Be careful with investments. I still hope for momentum to shift and make massive gains, but I also want to be realistic. I won't advise anyone here to buy or sell off these stocks. Ultimately, we have to make our own decisions. 

I started investing about a month and a half ago before the meme stocks. I was actually doing very well in that little time. This sets me back, but I will not make the same mistake again in the future. I'll stick with making smart choices and not complete risks.

TLDR: I bought into a meme stock. I learned my lesson. Don't fall for FOMO/Peer pressure. Make the best decision possible for yourself knowing the risks. A lot of people will lose money due to this. While I was in for a quick dollar, I will hold long-term now._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ (PSA)MAJOR issue with transferring my account from RH to TD Ameritrade Hello everyone. I am super stressed out, and wanted to get this out to see if anyone is experiencing the same issue.

January 28 was the date where RH started to restrict sales for GME, AMC, and others. I was holding GME, AMC, and BB, and sold them all before the crash later that day. Paper hands, yeah yeah, but I'm not made of money.

I shared the universal frustration towards RH that the entire internet felt that day and since, and decided to transfer my entire account from RH to TD Ameritrade. I sold the meme stocks, but was still holding my long-terms. I went to TD Ameritrade and submitted the transfer.

About a week passes, and I wake up this morning to check if my transfer was completed. RH FUCKING transfered GME, BB, and AMC to my TD AMERITRADE ACCOUNT AFTER I HAD SOLD THEM! And my transfer was only half completed as well. There was also a negative cash balance of $1000 in my TD Ameritrade account.

On the RH side of things, I had negative shares(yes, negative shares) of all the meme stocks in my portfolio. All of a sudden, around 10:30 the negative shares disappeared and RH RE BOUGHT the shares on my behalf to cancel the negative shares out even though my account was still technically "deactivated". Now, I have a negative buying power of $-500 in RH, along with the $-1000 in TD.

I called TD Ameritrade(Where you can actually speak to a real person.., unlike RH) and they said that this was entirely RH's error. The woman I spoke to said she has seen thousands of RH transfers get fucked up because of their doing, and that I have to go to RH's support to resolve it. The only problem is their support is incompetent and will probably take days to email me back.

I just wanted to post this for two reasons. The first is to see if anyone else has experienced this, and the second is to serve as a PSA of NOT to transfer your account from RH to anywhere. Liquidate your stocks into cash, fund your bank, then fund your new brokerage. It's what I should've done, now I need to either wait till RH resolves this shit or lawyer up.

Hey guys I’m fairly new to this and have wanted to start investing for a while now, admittedly bought in to GME to see what would happened and ended up with a couple hundred dollars profit, I’m honestly more glad that it incentivized me to finally set up a brokerage account, so I have a bit of money to actually invest. Anyway, I’m still trying to wrap my head around what ETF’s are and how to gauge when one should go in on them. After reading here it seems like I should probably put half my portfolios in etfs and that’s what I intend to do. I intend to put a hundred or so every pay check.

I'm new to stocks and have a limited knowledge of how they work, but to my understanding when a stock is selling in large quantities, the price goes up (supply and demand). This is what happened for GME, everyone bought in and the price went up. I realize there are other factors that go into a stocks price, but in simplest of terms that is what I understand.

&#x200B;

So with that being said, what is stopping a billionaire from dumping a ton of money into a stock, having the price go up, sell as soon as it does, and repeat. Some might call this "market manipulation" but to my understanding simply purchasing a stock is not illegal, regardless in the quantity that is being purchased.

&#x200B;

Hypothetical example: Bezos see's Ford(FORD) is valued at $3.685/stock. He then uses his ungodly amount of money to purchase the entire market cap of 36,381,772 of stocks for $134,066,830.00. Doing so causes the stock to rise to $3.90/stock, and then he sells instantly, resulting in a sell price of $141,888,911.00, or a net profit of $7.8M.

&#x200B;

I'm likely wrong about all of this, just looking for some clarification.

&#x200B;

Edit: RIP my inbox. I think I get it now. If someone buys all the stock and the price goes up, the price goes back down when they sell it. Not only that, but you have to have buyers lined up and can't just "dump" that many stocks at that price at once.

I was lurking around /rstocks and found this particular sentence, which gave me a feeling of an epiphany ("enlightenment") or however you call it.

I just realized how common this story is and probably just like me, most of you could relate to this if you are below upper-class (working/middle class) and you never studied economics or another business-related course at your university.

The "Keep them poor" comes from the author of the book "Rich and poor dad" written by R.Kiosaki. It opened my eyes, but actually, nothing happened. It was interesting, but no one around me had any clue about passive income, assets vs. liabilities and so on. My parents invested in some funds proposed by their bank, steady 2% pa. All they cared.

In high school and at my uni, I had 1 subject about economics, but these classes were not engaging and most of us did the minimal effort as we thought that you can't have a business without money, we haven't been taught (if the wrong gramma sorry, it's my 2 language)  ANYTHING about passive income and how to get the most out of it. Probably even our economic teachers don't use their knowledge in practice or they just don't want to share it?

**I would give you more articles or data, but that's not the point. The key idea of this thread is:**

1. **To appreciate the high volume of new traders.** I understand the frustration that suddenly all stock-related subreddits are flooded with dumb questions and low content threads. It is annoying when people keep asking if they should invest in stock x, y or z and spamming ( 🚀💎), Remember that hype will fade after some time, but 20-30% of these new investors will remain and start to learn!  Look at the bright side, more people = more trades = more gains/losses (😂), but also **there is a chance that we increase the amount of financially literate people among this 90%!**

Collectivist is a good thing and in this case, we should share our wisdom, by giving resources or advice to new traders, while **new traders should not expect straight answers (like sell or buy). That's not learning, but being lazy.** There are already threads about being patient and helpful, so I am really grateful for those(Shout-out for the authors).

But Uber has recently acquired Drizly, for $1.1billion and just a couple months ago acquired Postmates as well. It seems Uber is making big moves that will significantly increase the value of the company in the coming quarters. I feel like if people treated Uber like they treated Tesla, where they evaluated it’s worth prospectively, then it would be at a much higher price than it is now.

However, and this is a very strong argument, Uber has a ruthless business strategy which leaves drivers with less income than they deserve. Somehow it still works? And it seems Uber is only existing through growth right now,  it profit, which is a hallmark of companies like Amazon in its early stage. That being said it isn’t a good sign._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Is there any solid argument against setting a trailing stop limit/loss on every position? 
I've been thinking about this for a while and my opinion has flip flopped the last couple years. With the last year being as bullish as it was, several of my positions are up 50% or more, and I'd like to prevent significant loss in the case of a market downturn and have thought about placing ~15% trailing stop limit orders. I've heard a couple arguments against this being that 1) downturns allow you to buy in at a lower cost on your high conviction picks, and 2) they screw you over in high volatility stocks or in flash crashes. However if you backtest, it seems like you would have been able to get out of positions quickly in the March crash and even the 2008 crash using trailing stop losses as they happened over the course of days and not minutes. This would've allowed you more capital to buy back in at the dips than if you just held the entire time and bought in with only spare cash. Does anyone have strong arguments against this? How likely are flash crashes really and when was the last one greater than say 15%?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Using Revolut as a broker app Hi all, I was wondering what your opinions are of Revolut as an app for buy stocks.

I live in Europe so I don't have access to many of the American apps. I did my research before and I set up an account with Degiro but I haven't bought anything with it yet. Degiro has a good reputation in Europe but I find its UI very difficult to use and I don't like how you can't buy fractional shares. 

I used Revolut to jump on the meme stock craze (don't worry, I didn't spend much and only lost a couple hundred lol). 

Revolut is handy for this. It has a great UI and it's easy to use and transfer money. I like how I get to keep all my money in one place. 

The major drawback with Revolut is the limited stocks available. You have all the big ones like Apple and Tesla (and Gamestop) but there's lots of companies missing so no chance of using it for up and comers that aren't in the mainstream. 

I think Revolut is decent for day trading since depositing, buying, selling and withdrawing money is very easy but it also lacks a lot of information and features which makes me think it would be unwise to use for significant investment. 

I think I'll use Revolut for meme stocks (revolut is where I put all my disposable money) but I'll stick with Degiro for major long term investment.

Thanks & enjoy!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ BRK Seems Undervalued The current market valuations are pretty high historically. There are a number of reasons for that and not making an argument for the overall market being over or undervalued. Much of the valuation is driven by the top of the market, companies such as Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon. Those three alone make up a market cap of nearly $6 Trillion and have had pretty crazy stock price growth over the last few years. Berkshire Hathaway is the 8th most valuable company on the list sitting at around 550B market cap and has been underperforming the market for a while now. 


By market cap, AAPL is 4.13x as big as BRK. If there was a hypothetical where you could either have the entire company AAPL, or a fictional company that was essentially 4.13 Berkshires, here is what the financials would look like: 

|**In Billions**|||4.12922869|
:--|:--|:--|:--|
||**BRK**|**AAPL**|**Buy BRK 4.1 Times**|
|**Market Cap**| 550| 2,273| 2,273|
|||||
|**Total Revenue**| 279| 274| 1,153|
|**Net Income from Continuing &amp; Discontinued Operation**| 36| 58| 148|
|||||
|**Total Assets**| 818| 324| 3,377|
|**Cash**| 147| 192| 605|
|**Total Investments**| 366|| 1,510|
|**Total Equity**| 429| 65| 1,770|

So for the same price as AAPL, you could get a company with

$1.15 Trillion in revenue vs $274 Billion 

$148 Billion in net income vs $58 Billion 

**$605 Billion cash on hand** vs $192 Billion 

$1.5 Trillion investment portfolio vs $0 (does AAPL have investments?)

$1.8 Trillion balance sheet equity vs $65 Billion 


I know there are differences in the income growth of AAPL vs BRK, however from a fundamentals perspective, it looks like this would be a complete no brainer decision on which company I would want to own. It seems BRK themselves thing this is the case too as they have sold some of their position in AAPL and have been doing record buybacks of their own stock.

Can anyone fill me in on things I am missing or overlooking?

I’ve been reading this sub and other finance subs for a while now, and it seems like retail investors like us primarily do two types of analysis: fundamental analysis and technical analysis. Fundamental analysis seems like a subset of statistical arbitrage where you try to find “valuable” companies by looking at their financials and comparing it to other companies in same sector. Technical analysis seems like it’s trying to gauge investor sentiment graphically. However, I’m not sure how relevant these forms of analyses are in the world of quantitative easing, low interest rate, and quantitative hedge funds. With quantitative easing and low interests rates, it seems like the context has changed too much for value investing to be relevant. We always joke that the stock will go down because the company had a blowout earnings report and justify it by saying "it's priced in". With bots, quantitative hedge funds can look at fundamentals faster, look at a wider set of companies, better define relevant companies to compare against, and develop more intricate models rather than simply looking at P/E ratios. So, whatever fundamental analysis we do will always be at a disadvantage.

In the aftermath of a certain stock fiasco, I think information arbitrage using memes is a legitimate form of analysis, maybe better than fundamental and technical. For those that don’t know, information arbitrage is when we use alternative data other than a company’s financials to evaluate a company. For example, quantitative hedge funds use AI to read through news articles to gauge sentiment, satellite images to track shipping, web-traffic data to predict which retails will have the best quarter. Although we can’t do these tasks as fast as computers, I think humans have an edge, albeit small and fading, in understanding language and especially memes. Language changes quickly on social media, and humans adapt to the evolution of language much more quickly and with less supervision than AI. Meme formats change and evolve quickly online, and we’re able to understand the underlying meaning with few examples whereas AI need lots of heavily curated data to learn the same thing. By the time they learn one meme, the format may change invalidating the older model. It’s true that we have our own problems when we get sucked into echo chambers and personal feelings, but I think we have a smallish window before AI catches up to analyzing public sentiment through memes, and we shouldn’t discount the “meme analysis” as a legitimate form of financial analysis for now.

I’m an IS major in college right now, so anything involving IoT is interesting to me. Everything I’ve read so far has led me to believe that the company can get out of its debt fairly easily when it wants to. It should also be primed for strong growth this year, and the next couple of years.

So some info:

* Tiger Brokers is an up-and-coming online brokerage growing accounts and revenue >100%/yr by focusing on Chinese traders.
* Tiger is already profitable; tapping its underpenetrated customer base will fuel further gains.
* In the longer term, as Chinese wealth continues to grow, Tiger has an addressable market in the tens of trillions of dollars.
* Initially, as Tiger worked to build out its own technology, it used Interactive Brokers to process and clear its customers’ trades, which allowed it to launch new products more quickly but cut into profitability. Last year, however, after acquiring a US-based broker, Tiger began to self-clear more of its trades and move toward full independence. In fact, Interactive Brokers – a major player in the US online brokerage sector for decades, with a \~$30 billion market cap -- recognized Tiger’s potential from early on and made a strategic investment in its shares; it now owns 7.6% of the company.
* Some stats: Market Cap: 3.84 Billion, Float Cap 1.55 Billion 
*  Tiger’s entrepreneurial spirit and scalable technology have also empowered it to expand into new geographic markets, like Singapore and Australia 
* Tiger Broker Shares have risen from \~$15 dollars to $26 dollars in the past week. Side note I am using Tiger Brokers to trade so I'm currently loving it HAHA :P

Do not sell off winners for potential winners.

I've been in this situation where I am building my personal business up, so though I've been doing very well any extra income or cash goes back into helping me grown my business. It's put me in a tough investing situation because I'm a bit of a junkie and I like to get into stocks after DD, but have not had the cash to do so. Unfortunately that's led to me selling portions of my winners for profits to try and make profits elsewhere, and though I've maintained good gains and been able to diversify it seems that the stocks I sell always out preform the stocks I buy, at least so far. In any case I guess what I'm saying is I've learned to be patient, utilize your watch lists and only sell winners if you believe they've capped out, not so you can free up funds to chase other winners.

Market took down $700Mn issuance yesterday and the stock still traded up on the day. Issuance shows that the model is catching on in markets. US home sales + prices are rising quick, driving revenue. **Targeting $60 after earnings.** Chart looks a lot like SPCE, PLTR early days, market is sleeping on OPEN. Options pointing to a big move.

Plan to role my febs into march on dips.

**What is OpenDoor?**

OpenDoor is a principal dealer in the real estate market. Instead of hiring a real estate agent to sell your house charging 3-5% commission and having to deal with the showings and negotiations, Opendoor will buy the house right off the seller for cold hard cash. Not only that, the Company will provide ancillary services to clients including refis, and possibly home credit lines in the future.

Ultimately, as the primary point of contact for a buyer and seller, OpenDoor not only disrupts the embedded real estate industry cabal, but also the banking cabal. By providing financing/brokerage and other ancillary services we believe that the $1.6Trn TAM presented by the Company is low.

**Why Now?**

Yesterday, OpenDoor announced a 24Mn share raise equating to approximately $700Mn. The market took it down no problem and the stock traded up on the day which is strange because raises usually result in price declines due to dilution of existing shareholders. The underlying strength in the stock gives us confidence that we trade much higher over the coming weeks.

On the press release of the raise, OpenDoor said the issuance will be used for "increasing existing market penetration and to expand into new markets, and for working capital and general corporate purposes." They have essentially told us that they ran out of cash buying so many homes and needed an additional raise to further expand the business. Given that one of the main bear views has been that most sellers would rather go to the market to attempt to get a better sale value, the raise shows the market that this point of friction is actually not as significant as many believed, likely the reason why the stock traded higher.

**Key Drivers**

With the new leverageable cash (we estimate total $2Bn of levered cash) we expect OpenDoor to announce entry into new markets including Detroit, San Diego, Chicago, San Francisco/San Jose, Seattle, New Orleans, Albuquerque, Ft. Lauderdale and Miami in the near future. We believe that movement into these markets alone would double the revenue opportunity.

U.S. home prices are rising quickly. According to the CoreLogic Home Price Index, December showed home prices spiking 9.2% annually, which was the fastest annual increase since 2014. Month-over-month, prices were up by 1%. Given that OPEN makes most of its money on the s/t gains in housing prices, this data suggests that OPEN will likely blow out sell-side expectations over the next two quarters.

**Prices and sales rising quickly**

Also, home sales are increasing rapidly. COVID is pushing city dwellers to move from major metro areas to the suburbs and other smaller cities where OpenDoor has inventory. Easy monetary policy is further supporting homebuying which will likely drive revenue for the foreseeable future.

**Setup**

OPEN has been battling with the $28-29 resistance for four months, with rising support. If we break to the upside with volume, we could see a move similar to September (\~65%) and October (\~70%).

Yesterday, there was a lot of call buying and a spike in implied vols potentially foreshadowing a big move in the future.

In sum, OPEN is a great business and the stock has a great setup. We expect the stock to be higher over the coming months.

Thank you!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ The emerging agricultural LED tech market Grow light technology is rapidly evolving beyond simply growing plants indoors with the prevalent "full spectrum" marketing slogan. There are many specially tuned light type arrays and intervals, which effect everything from livestock behavior/growth speed and the color/taste of produce.

There's a major growth opportunity with this tech, coupled with emerging environmental and sociopolitical climates, such as:

* Climate change is shifting the tropical rain belts in the Eastern hemisphere (Europe/Asia) more northern per the recent [Nature article](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-020-00963-x): where there's less sunlight on average, forcing LED adoption to offset crop loss from shorter days, particularly in subarctic regions.
* Climate instability: with flooding, drought, etc. climate patterns becoming harder to predict, both livestock and plant growth need moderately reliable patterning to accurately meet future agricultural output goals and projections.
* There's a growing demand for stable food security and production across Asia, as a matter of national security, especially in the wake of pandemic food supply chain disruptions.

Plants and livestock both benefit from specifically tuned LED color combos, which effect growth speeds, enhanced flavors, etc. and where a few companies are now innovating.

This snippet from the Everlight Electronics [wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everlight_Electronics) is pretty good TLDR of the space:

>In 2019, Everlight's newly formed optoelectronic R&D team introduced tunable LEDs to maximize animal husbandry and aquaculture.  
>  
>For instance in poultry farming, exposing a chicken to white light takes 172 days to reach reproductive maturity, while exposing to red light reduces to 168 days, but blue light increases maturity to 182 days. Green light exposure makes poultry gain weight faster, due to growth hormone receptor stimulation and enhancement of satellite glial cells which promote muscle development.  
>  
>The R&D team also introduced UV LEDs for eggshell surface sanitization and water disinfection for waste water runoff. In collaboration with Dr. Kun-Hsien Tsai, Professor at College of Public Health at National Taiwan University, a novel ovitrap was introduced which pulses Ultraviolet C to regularly destroy collected mosquito eggs.  
>  
>In 2020, Everlight collaborated with Professor Wang Yong-song’s team of the Institute of Fisheries Science, National Taiwan University to develop a special LED lamp for grouper fish aquaculture, where specific wavelength exposure reduces cannibalization and loss of fingerlings by over 40%.  
>  
>In 2021, Everlight released new horticultural LEDs in spectrums tailored to augment the red pigment of strawberries. Strawberries rely on sunlight to produce their red color through a process called anthocyanin biosynthesis, but in areas with little sunlight horticultural LEDs can be used to catalyze this biochemical process instead.

My understanding is that index funds are not actively managed and are essentially a computer running an algorithm that purchases stocks in a certain ETF like SPY. 

Mutual funds are like index funds but theyre actively managed and have a higher fee than index funds do. An mutual fund ETF like Ark. 

An ETF is just something that reads a certain industry or commodity._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Would it be wise to invest in Nintendo right now?

A few questions:

1. I was thinking of making a stop loss order at my current position in case it rises above and then falls. Or should I do a stop limit order? I don't see the real difference between the two.
2. If all my shares are tied up in this stop/limit order, can I still sell them all manually if the price reaches a certain profit that I want to sell?

I understand that taxes are necessary, but for a middle class person, trying to rise up from a poor family it seems crazy to pay high taxes on any gains I've made.  Regardless I will pay, but my question is 

a) is trading even worth it. 

I spend hours researching companies and making pretty good picks and I like to swing trade. I'm getting pretty good at it after a few years of practicing with about 1k. This year so far I made 10k. But I'm going to have to pay a lot in taxes. 

I realize I can buy and hold for less taxes after a year but there are so many opportunities to invest in now and I don't have the capital to sit and park money in for a year like that. 

Is this still worth it once taxes are factored in? My goal is to make 33 trades at 22% (1k initially) or more each time and get to 200k. I realize this is easier said than done but I am on successful trade number 7. 

_-------

Also I keep reading that I can make quarterly payments on tax gains, and actually may have to. I've been all over the irs site to find out more about this and where I can pay. It's extremely unintuitive and I feel lost. Anyone point me in the right direction? If the government wanted my money so much I feel they could make this slightly easier.

Ford Motor has decided to terminate plans to launch electric vehicle joint ventures with China's Zotye Automobile, the U.S. auto giant said on Thursday.

It said that China's electric vehicle industry and government policies had undergone major changes since the agreements were signed in 2017 and 2018, prompting Ford's decision. Ford didn't specify which changes triggered its move.

Last week, Ford said its China joint venture with Chongqing Changan Automobile Co would start making all-electric Mustang Mach-E vehicles.

In a statement on Thursday, Ford said it would pursue a more "flexible business model in China" that would see it utilise its existing operations in the country and elsewhere, and build related business centres.

Zotye did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

In 2017, during a visit by former U.S. President Donald Trump to China, Ford and Zotye said that they would invest a combined $756 million to set up a 50-50 joint venture in China to build small electric passenger vehicles.

A year later, the two companies said they had signed a memorandum of understanding for another venture that would make electric vehicles for ride-hailing fleets.

EV makers from home-grown Nio Inc to U.S. leader Tesla Inc have been expanding manufacturing capacity in the world's largest auto market, where the government is heavily promoting greener vehicles as a means of reducing chronic air pollution.

Sales of electric, plug-in hybrid and hydrogen-powered vehicles in China are forecast to rise to 20% of new car sales by 2025 from just 5% now, the State Council said in November._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Amazon to build $200 million distribution center in eastern Tennessee https://www.marketwatch.com/story/amazon-to-build-200-million-distribution-center-in-eastern-tennessee-01612402929

Separately, Amazon AMZN is also building an operations hub in Nashville that is expected to create 5,000 jobs in the area.

“Over the past year, Amazon has announced projects in each of Tennessee’s grand divisions, accounting for nearly 3,000 new jobs,” Lee said in a statement. “As we continue to navigate through the pandemic and reboot our economy, we know our recovery is supported by the success of our Tennessee businesses.”_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Looking for information on IRCP Hi,

I am new and looking for DD assistance, as I don't know wth I am looking for.

My first approach to investing was to look at stocks that dropped due to the circumstances of COVID-19 and might recover. I thought IRCP almost fit this profile, but noted a historic downward trend in stock price, but ignored this as recent prices are extremely low comparable to past prices.

I put in a small investment to see where it went, to my surprise I received a 35.92% dividend. After this I figured it was worth continuing my investment, so have invested some more in hopes of either a rise in price or exceptional dividend.

Can someone help me understand the fundamentals of the company? And whether this is high risk? Would like to weigh up pros and cons to see if I should stay locked in.

# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Thursday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/04/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-february-4-2021.html)

*****

> # 1. Dow, S&P 500 look to extend their rallies to four straight days

> * U.S. stock futures rose Thursday as the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 looked to add to their three-session winning streaks. The Nasdaq on Wednesday dipped after two straight days of strong advances. The Dow and S&P 500 eked gains Wednesday following rallies Monday and Tuesday as the Reddit-fueled retail trading frenzy dissipated.

> * GameStop was once again volatile, finishing up nearly 2.7% at $92.41 per share Wednesday but still down 71% from Friday’s close of $325. In last week’s 400% surge, shares reached an all-time intraday high of $483 each. GameStop rose modestly in Thursday’s premarket.

> * The Labor Department is set to release its weekly look at jobless claims at 8:30 a.m. ET. Economists expect 830,000 filings for initial unemployment benefits for the week ending Jan. 30. That would be down from the prior week’s 847,000. The government reports its January employment report Friday. ADP said Wednesday 174,000 jobs were added last month at U.S. companies, more than triple expectations.

*****

> # 2. Ken Frazier to retire as Merck CEO at end of June

> * Merck Chairman and CEO Ken Frazier will retire effective June 30. He’ll be replaced as CEO by company CFO Robert Davis. Frazier, 66, will become executive chairman for what the drugmaker described as a “transition period to be determined by the board.” Frazier, one of the few Black corporate leaders in the United States, has served as Merck’s chief executive since January 2011.

> * Frazier’s retirement was announced Thursday morning shortly before Merck reported fourth-quarter earnings and revenue that fell short of estimates. Per-share profit was $1.32 on $12.5 billion in revenue. Merck forecast full-year 2021 earnings between $6.48 to $6.68 per share, which were higher than analyst expectations. Dow stock Merck was little changed in the premarket.

*****

> # 3. Apple and Hyundai-Kia pushing toward deal on Apple Car

> * Apple shares rose nearly 2% in Thursday’s premarket, the morning after CNBC reported, according to multiple sources, the tech giant is close to finalizing a deal with Hyundai-Kia to manufacture an Apple-branded autonomous electric vehicle at the Kia assembly plant in West Point, Georgia. The so-called “Apple Car,” which is being developed by a team at Apple, is tentatively scheduled to go into production in 2024, though people familiar with the talks said the eventual rollout could be pushed back.

*****

> # 4. Klobuchar unveils antitrust reform that would impact Big Tech

> * Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., unveiled a sweeping antitrust reform bill Thursday, setting a tough tone in her new role as chair of the Senate Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust. If enacted, it would bring significantly more risk to companies like Facebook and Alphabet-owned Google, which are already facing federal lawsuits, and to any dominant firm seeking to acquire another company. House antitrust subcommittee chairman David Cicilline, D-R.I., has similarly called for extensive reforms that would impact Big Tech.

*****

> # 5. Biden signals flexibility on Covid stimulus

> * President Joe Biden encouraged Democratic lawmakers to “act fast” on his $1.9 trillion coronavirus rescue plan but also signaled flexibility. Changes he indicated he would consider include limiting proposed $1,400 direct payments to Americans with lower income levels, which directionally could draw support from Republicans who want a much smaller package. Biden told lawmakers in private comments Wednesday he’s “not married” to an absolute number for the overall bill but wants them to “go big” on pandemic relief and “restore the soul of the country.”

What's on everyone's radar for today's trading day ahead here at r/stocks?

# **I hope you all have an excellent trading day ahead today on this Thursday, February 4th, 2021! :)**_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ ARK Funds / Tesla Hey - I'm considering allocating some capital from the a recent play (I left some days ago with XX% gain) to ARK funds, particularly to ARKK, ARKQ and ARKW.

One thing that I'm concerned about is the \~9-10% weight of Tesla in all of those, especially as I'm already long Tesla directly via TSLA, which would potentially move the whole allocation to XX% of portfolio in Tesla - any way to offset that via puts or so ?

Edit: ended up getting equal proportion in G Q K & W_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Kuaishou's insane valuation at HK IPO brings thoughts to $BILI valuation [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-04/kuaishou-technology-surges-142-in-hong-kong-gray-market-trading](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-04/kuaishou-technology-surges-142-in-hong-kong-gray-market-trading)

"The short-video startup, backed by [Tencent Holdings Ltd.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/700:HK), advanced by as much as 181% to HK$322.80 on Thursday on an over-the-counter retail platform operated by Phillip Securities Group. If the stock rises by as much during its debut on Friday, it would become the second-best debut for an IPO over $1 billion in Hong Kong on record, data compiled by Bloomberg shows.

Meanwhile, shares jumped as much as 200% on the Bright Smart Securities International (H.K.) Ltd. platform and up to 266% on the Futu Securities International (Hong Kong) Ltd. platform."

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The insane $200B+ valuation of Kuaishou(HK 01024) before its IPO debut on Friday brings up massive discussion about the video industry in China. This makes investors re-imagine the $BILI valuation before its HK debut sometime in March.

IMO, $BILI is a long time hold as it has huge potential in China. YOUKU and similar old names have already faded out, and $BILI is taking over the market in lightspeed. While Kuaishou focuses on the rural area users and creates a trend in the form of 土味(I have no idea how to explain this in English, sub-cultural retardation in a more aesthetical sense?), $BILI on the other hand, attracts a broader spectrum of users. I have to admit that, I've never thought of myself using $BILI as it seemed to me as just a platform for anime related stuff, and I don't watch anime. After several years I realized that there's literally nowhere else to go, Youku is outdated, Tudou is long dead. Youtube is my no.1 go-to place for videos, but as a native Chinese speaker, Youtube does not have enough Chinese content creators. Now that vlogging is a growing industry I can only see this growing much faster for $BILI. ByteDance takes over the short videos and $BILI will surely dominate the regular video side. $BILI is set to be the Youtube of China(lol it sucks ball that censorship became even stricter. Fuck em.)

This insane valuation might come from Kuaishou's growing stake in E-Commerce. Its GMV reached ￥332B Yuan, 5 times more than that of 2019. Kuaishou is able to monetize its user, how about $BILI? $BILI's rap show "The New Generation” could hint at a very doable path forward for $BILI. $BILI is still burning cash at this stage, but with the growing user base, it has huge potential in profiting.

With $BILI going to raise funds in HK early this year, I can only imagine $BILI share price grow much more so that they can price a good number and raise more funds. This would also make investors and institutions rethink the value of $BILI. Investor sentiment around $BILI spiked to another level after they saw what happened with Kuaishou.

$BILI will probably go to HK in March if I remember it correctly.

I’ve been a member of this community along with the other big stock market communities on Reddit for a couple of years now. I used to really enjoy reading DDs on obscure or interesting companies. I loved checking the sub each day because I never knew what new pieces of information I would find. Some of my favorite stocks I found searching through new/hot. With the whole GME fiasco (I like WSB but I like to keep it separate from my actual investments) every single stock market community seems to be exclusively focused on pumps or squeezes or meme stocks and I just want a community to discuss interesting companies and fundamentals.

From the perspective of selling, I see puts deep in the money where the delta between market and strike is less then the premium offered, for example APHA FEB19'21 18p with a premium of 2.88, strike minus premium means an effective cost of $15.12/share whereas market price is ~$16.75

So this put would expire and be automatically assigned because market is lower then strike? And as long as the market price stays between $15.12-$18 you would basically be getting the shares at a discount?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ CRMD - Producing Defencath, ready for FDA approval by end of February Cross posted in r/pennystocks

Hi all.

This is my first DD post so if there are any discrepancies, please let me know.

&#x200B;

**Bull Case:**

CorMedix, ticker CRMD, is on the cusp of gaining FDA approval for their drug Defencath.

Defencath is a solution which prevents infections from catheters which is an extremely common problem of about 250,000 cases a year in the USA alone.

Defencath is already being used in the EU under the name of Neutrolin and studies have shown a 96% decrease in infection rates.

The FDA is set to approve the drug by end February 2021.

CorMedix has 10 year marketing exclusivity of Defencatch if the FDA review goes through.

They have begun trading on the NASDAQ exchange in January 2021

Their senior management has plenty of prior experience in launching new drugs.

&#x200B;

**Bear Case:**

They have already gone up quite a bit since the end of last year and I can't predict what an appropriate price would be as I don't personally believe in price targets.

Their financials are not strong. Their net income has been dipping since 2019 but all this could very well change with FDA approval.

&#x200B;

**TL;DR:** CRMD is a company that I am bullish on because they are on the cusp of solving a major medical issue in the USA with a drug that is already in the market in Europe.

&#x200B;

Please do your own DD.

Is anyone here into Skyworks right now? Just recently I bought some SWKS stock and within days it experienced quite good growth as a result (as i understand) of some good reports. 

Just recently it fell quite hard, like 10%. And I do not understand why. I searched a lot of news and the only major thing that came up just at that time was some news about Stimulus in the US. But I failed to relate this news to this stock.. so my question is: what was the reason for such a drop? Is it that the stock was overpriced in the first place and it has something with fundamentals? 

I am sorry for such silly questions, I just want to understand what info am I missing and try to do better DD in the future._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Is IqOption really that dodge?

Upstart: ipo was last year and it has gradually increased in share price so far this year. Upstart is a replacement for FICO credit rating system that increases approval ratings while reducing risk for their banking partners. They have started with personal loans but will be moving into auto loans soon and within the next couple of years mortgages. Apparently they are working with small lenders now with hopes of bringing on large lenders in the future. The most interesting part of this company is it was founded by former google employees including David Girouard who was president of google enterprise and built the google cloud system. 

Match: I haven’t done as much looking into match but they also owns tinder and almost every other dating site/app besides bumble. I feel like online dating will only get bigger and bigger. They also seem to have great leadership in all aspects.

From what I see, the vehicle could be out as soon as 2024. 

This news alone could bump the stock price up once the deal is finalized in the coming days or weeks. Apple is a safe bet as a long term investment and with entering the autonomous vehicle industry, we could see an even larger steady growth of the stock.

Lending someone money and charging interest in return, or borrowing money in exchange for agreeing to pay interest in return, are both not permitted by my religion(islam). For example, getting a traditional bank loan to buy a house is technically not allowed in Islam because you typically have to pay back the loan with interest, and interest is prohibited in the Quran, as I explained in the beginning. Isn’t buying a stock just buying a portion of a company? Sort of like purchasing a piece of property? When that company is doing well, aka business is good, lots of people are buying goods from said company, the company’s stock value goes up, and at that point I could sell the stock of that company I had bought earlier, for a profit since I’d be selling when the value of the comapany’s stock went up that I own. Isn’t this form of buying and trading stock from the stock market, different from getting a loan from a bank in exchange for agreeing to pay it back to the bank with interest? I don’t really know much about finance, I’m currently 20 and hoping to learn more starting now. What are the different forms of making money/profit from investing in the stock market or trading I think it’s called? I think short selling or borrowing stocks has interest involved so that’s not allowed in my religion, like shorting stocks I think involves interest, as does short squeeze, whatever that means, but there’s gotta be a way to make profit from investing in the stock market that would be considered permissible in my religion, for example, not short selling or borrowing stocks, but actually buying stocks and then waiting for their value to rise, and then selling them for a profit? This method would not involve interest, right?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ What are your portfolio balancing rates? I'm a beginning invester and I'm not looking for advise on how to balance my portfolio(Already have an idea) but I'm quite curious to see what your guys balancing rates are. For example:

I want to invest long term so I'm thinking 70% (All world)ETF's for long term, and 30% individual stocks to keep it fun for myself and I can afford to take the risk as I'm still young and have plenty of time to slowly shift towards ETF's only._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Are our securities and the cash in brokerages insured? Just as the title says, are our assets that we hold in brokerage accounts insured similar to cash in Bank accounts?

I have been trying to withdraw cash out of Rh since this whole fiasco began, and I keep getting error codes. I have three different accounts linked, that I have been able to deposit into RH, but I can't withdraw to any of them. I am getting worried about getting cash out. Even if I sell all my securities, I'm getting the feeling that I won't be able to pull out. After several tries I have been able to get 2/3 of the cash I had sitting out in fragments.

Has anyone else had this issue? I've opened a request, but they are still getting back to me, and I know they are overwhelmed now.

Having said that, would it be beneficial to keep your account balanced under a certain level? And have multiple accounts with various brokers?

Hey all, I’m pretty new to this and I’m sure you can guess why, but I’ve really gotten a legitimate interest in the market and pulled out of meme stocks and invested in some long stocks and made some modest gains, but still gains nonetheless (and it beats letting my funds sit in a bank doing literally nothing). With that being said, I have my current funds all in blue chips aside from being up in CCL as a prospective venture. My question is: would you advise or is it smart to take a gamble and acquire shares in a company right before their earnings call? 

Example: ATVI has an earnings call @16.30 today, they are projected to have a high return and I know from personal knowledge in the company that they did very well with sales and whatnot (I don’t know how Wall Street calculates valuation so this is extremely ad-hoc). With me feeling bullish about the company, would it be a decent idea for me to snag stocks at or around market open in preparation for the earnings report? I feel like this would be a good idea, but I also am not sure and would like some more insight on if this is a common practice or not. Thanks!

It’s against my religion to charge and/or pay interest. For example, it’s technically not allowed in my religion to get a traditional bank loan to buy a house and pay it back with interest. I’m muslim by the way, and many muslims still get traditional home loans to buy houses even though they know its against their religion as outlined in the Quran, but many of them hope that God will forgive them. 

Is there a way for me to buy and sell stocks without getting involved with interest? I’m hoping there is because I’m muslim and I would like to invest/trade some stocks for profit. This question can be taken as a way to help any other muslims who are probably wondering the same thing as me right about now, considering there’s close to 2 billion muslims on Earth & it’s the fastest growing religion. If anyone can answer this question, then that would be much appreciated. If you hate muslims or you hate islam or religion in general and you want to use this opportunity to troll or be hateful, I ask that you kindly please refrain from doing that and don’t bother responding in that case.

No one individual gets to set the price of a stock, a stock price is completely based on supply and demand. No one individual gets to say I can't buy this stock at 233. Imagine not letting people buy Tesla because they say it is not worth 810 billion dollars as of today. When would a brokerage ever try and stop retail from losing money? They only stopped buying because there was risk of an infinite squeeze. This is not a reason to halt buying, they halted buying not just for those at risk of not being able to pay, they halted buying for EVERYONE. Anyone with one ounce of economics knows if you stop allowing buying you completely shift your supply and demand graph to the right cratering shares.

Think about it. There is a BIGGER question here. Something very fishy is going on.

Hi all,

$AVXL enjoyed a pretty large surge (+37.85%) yesterday, and climbed even more dramatically in after-market (+54.62%). Given recent events I was initially reticent to see this as anything other than another meme train, but after finding little discussion about it on Reddit my curiosity was piqued.

I was struggling to find any concrete reason for this sudden rally, but after a bit more digging I discovered that in the middle of January, the company received a research grant from the Michael J Fox Foundation to continue research on a promising treatment for Parkinson's disease. For those who don't know, AVXL is a biopharmaceutical company focusing on neurodegenerative disorders. The treatment in question is a drug called blarcamesine, which is currently in phase II trials for Parkinson's, and also phase I for Alzheimer's, where it's hypothesised that it may be able to offer lasting structural improvements, rather than band-aid treatment of symptoms.

With this in mind, I'm slightly more optimistic about this rally, especially given that it's still trading below previous highs for the company. I suspect there may be a short term bubble built around this sudden rise, but my instinct is that there's some long term value here. I bought in with a little fun money yesterday and made a tidy little profit, but I'm tempted to follow up with something a little more substantial. I'd be very interested to hear what this sub's thoughts are..._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Where can you find the strike price for senior convertible notes? Hello,

I tried asking on r/wsb, that was a mistake. I'm just interested in understanding what's going on in the market recently, specifically with GME.

What I've understood so far (at least what I think I have):

- The basics of short selling. 

- How a short interest of greater than 100% means shares are being shorted that do not exist.

- How retail has been driving the price up forcing HFs to cover at a loss. In turn, the price rises higher, hence a short squeeze.

- How calls ITM force writers to cover driving price up.

- Why RH stoped buying due to inadequate capital to satisfy raised collateral requirements by the DTC (or DTCC?) which were raised because of increased volatility.

- Following that, how trades take t+2 days to settle.

Where does FTD come into play here, how is it created and what is the problem with it?

After the recent fiasco, I decided that I'd split my investments across multiple apps. I downloaded Vanguard, which I was immediately confused by as I had to pick some type of investment option before proceeding (can't just view tickers) so I went with a Roth IRA (I was intending to eventually get one anyway). 

However, the interface and UI is absolute s***, I can't even navigate or figure out why my $500 isn't investable into a stock.

Can I close out this Roth IRA on vanguard and move it over to wherever else?

Thanks!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Question about shorting/calls I'm not too familiar with shorting stocks or calls/puts, etc. so I'm a little confused. So with all this stuff going on about squeezes and hedge funds trying to short stocks, my question is; for something like AMC, people kept saying that hedge funds needed the stock to close last Friday at about $9 to make money but it closed at about $13. Those same people are saying that the hedge funds need to cover their losses and buy those shares which will drive the stock price up, yada yada yada. Now I've seen people post on WSB and other places about it but I'm curious if this is actually how it works or if these people don't really know what they're talking about. I feel like if that was true more people would hold their shares to make sure they gain profits, which would essentially be a win/win for them. So something just doesn't add up. Is this really how it works?

I'm not a bot or trying to convince anyone to buy a stock. I'm generally curious._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Completely obsessed with stocks now - have a bunch of questions! First of all, yes, I'm a complete newbie who got interested in stocks after originally following the recent GME fiasco in /r/WSB.

I've never invested in the market before - not even owning a GIC (I'm in Canada, BTW, if that matters) or mutual fund. In the past, when people asked me why I don't invest in the stock market, I've always replied with "because I don't want to put my money in something I know absolutely nothing about". While I don't think that was necessarily a bad rationale, I also think I was a bit lazy. I guess I saw the stock market as overly risky.

I've invested in real estate, and have done well so far and want to buy more properties, but you need a minimum of around $125,000 (CAD) for a down payment here, and while I save up funds for my next down payment, my money literally just sits in a 0% interest bank account doing nothing.

My plan now is to very slowly learn and invest in the stock market so that I can do something with some of my money while I build up enough funds for my next down payment on an income property.

I'm currently waiting to set up a brokerage account to trade under my corporation. I went to the bank today to set up an account, but I have to reschedule with another advisor who has the clearance to set up an account under my corporate account, so I have to wait another week for that appointment. I've meanwhile created an account under my personal account with WealthSimple (kind of a Canadian RH, I guess), and am just waiting for my funds to clear there which should be any day now.

Some questions for you!

1. With what I know so far and my limited knowledge, index funds, or possibly EFTs, seem to be what I plan on focusing on to start. The S&P500 appears to be $3,800 a share, but the SPY EFT seems to essentially the same thing, almost like a 10% fractal share of S&P500 in a way, so it's more affordable in smaller amounts (and can be traded "live"), do I have that right? This seems to be a pretty safe bet in the long term. I also plan to buy 1-2 shares of GME just for the offchance that something happens with it, and for "fun", but my plan for now is to focus mostly on slow "safe" bets such as indexes, maybe 90% indexes / 5% meme / 5% other stocks. Does that sound okay for a newbie?

2. I've read that Indexes tend to yield, on average over the long term, 10% return year over year. That just seems absurd to me. Is that right? It seems incredibly high for such a "sure thing" long term. In real estate, cap rates tend to be around 6% here, and while you make the real money when you sell from appreciation and leverage, a 10% passive return is kind of mind boggling to me. Again, I know there are some risks, but the S&P500 (boy that's annoying to type) has only increased over time. There is risk in real estate too. So my question is - am I missing anything here? It just seems too good to be true.

3. Related to above, if I invested $50,000 5 years ago in the S&P500 [http://stockchoker.com/?s=SPY&d=20160206&a=50000](http://stockchoker.com/?s=SPY&d=20160206&a=50000) it would have grown to $111,933.32 with an Annual rate of return of: 17.49 and total profit of $61,933.32. I'm not missing anything here right? I mean, it's not factoring in currency exchange rate or the broker's fees, but still... jesus, it seems like I've been throwing money away for decades by not investing in the market.

4. Any recommendations for books or guides or courses on extremely basic stock market knowledge? The ones linked in the FAQ don't seem that suited to me. I learn best when taught the extreme basics from the very ground up (like, what is a stock, what is a dividend, what is market cap, and builds upon those building blocks). I was thinking maybe a book like Beginner's Guide to Stocks, but am wondering if there may be something better or up to date online that is good? Or do you think just reading Reddit is enough?

Thanks! I've pretty much abandoned my other entertainment activities because the stock market just seems so fascinating to me!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Why are call options said to be more profitable than buying stocks? I'm trying to understand why call options can be seen as more profitable than just buying the stock. Is my math wrong here? I'm having a massive brainfart.

With options for example, I can currently get an AMC strike price of $8 on a premium of $2.32 per share. I spend $232 for the single contract of 100 shares and AMC goes to $12. Now I exercise the contract and buy 100 shares for a total of $800. We subtract $1200 - $800 - $232 = $168.

If I just buy 100 shares for $800 outright and sell them for $1200, my profit would be $400. Why is my math showing that buying the stock is more profitable?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $RIDE with Lordstown Motors!

As many of you are aware there has been a sudden influx of new investors and new users joining our community. I was debating whether I should make a post, because I may take some heat for this.

The Dems now have control of the house, the senate and the presidency and Chuck Schumer made his intentions clear that cannabis reform is a top priority this year. Because of this, the hype is back and the number of posters and comments has increased dramatically.

My concern is that I'm seeing a lot of misinformed posters spreading false information and making misleading claims. Daily, there are comments with false or inaccurate posts. The most egregious one is the recent APHA/Tilray pump that has been happening all over reddit. If you look at any of the big investing or stock forums you will see a daily post about how APHA/TLRY are the best way to play U.S. Cannabis legalization.

The reason everyone needs to be careful with this is because Apha and Tilray don't have a single license to grow or sell cannabis in the United States. If you want to play the U.S. Cannabis boom, you should be looking at investing in American companies, CGC or the sleep-easy pick MSOS ETF which holds all the top U.S. pot stocks.

**Again, Apha/Tilray are a Canadian producer that owns a small U.S. craft beer company without a single license to grow or sell cannabis in the United States.**

Claiming they will be "the world’s biggest cannabis company." will be short lived at best as they most likely won't even be in the top 5 when U.S. decriminalization occurs. Curaleaf, Green Thumb, Cresco, Trulieve are all U.S. multi state operators and they are all top players and well positioned to continue domination the U.S.

I'm also seeing A LOT of comparison between APHA and CGC with people claiming that Aphria will move up to match Canopy's market cap. CGC is well positioned as well as they are backed by Costellation Brands (STZ), a fortune 500 company who invested $5 billion in them and they have used that money to open their own wholly owned retail stores, a beverage plant, they have Biosteel sports nutrition which is the official drink of the Raptors, Sixers and Mavericks, Martha Stewart CBD, they have several celebrity and athlete endorsements, This Works cosmetics, Storz & Bickel, and they sell CBD pet products as well. And of course, a clear path of entry into the U.S. via the acquisition of Acreage a U.S. multi state operator in 15 States with 29 open dispensaries and 7 production facilities. they also have a stake in Terrascend another U.S. MSO.

Aphria has none of what I mention above. It will be extremely difficult for them to surpass any of the top players in the space. Once the APHA/TLRY merger is completed, their combined company cash to debt position will be alarming and will need to be addressed. On top of that, the only way for them to enter and compete and get licenses in the states is to acquire a U.S. multi state operator and the only way for them to do it is by raising $$ by diluting shareholders.

Again, there is a lot of misinformation being shared right now about APHA/Tilray, the biggest one being that they are a strong play for U.S. legalization. You would be better off going with literally any of the U.S. multi state operators over them or MSOS.

With that being said, if you have recently joined this community and are looking to play the U.S. decimalization/legalization cannabis boom, this is a generational opportunity that has the potential to change your life if you invest in the right companies.

I'm a total noob so looking for any tips/suggestions._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Value and speculative plays for 2021 and on After doing some solid DD the past few weeks I've decided on 5 positions that I want to be in my port for the remainder of the year and possibly going forward much longer. 

1. GE, ge is honestly one of my favorite stocks right now and I mainly speculate. I believe in Larry Culp and he has a contract to be the CEO until 2024. I think that is great news for shareholders and people betting on a rebound. They are up tremendously for the year already but long term, I see them regaining investor trust and growing further. Their cash position is beating expectations. If they can reinstate their dividend, great news. Once flying is normalized (could be years) they stand to benefit from that as well. I love this stock and I've been buying calls on it all summer and it's treated me well. I had to pick up shares after their earnings report.

2. Enbridge, I've looked into canadian energy stocks and I believe this one has great potential. Their pipelines offer them a huge moated business and have great contracts tied to them. I believe this company is extremely undervalued and should be looked into by people hoping to benefit from oil without exposing themselves to too much risk in the short term. The dividend is tasty as well. 

3. Exxon, I love them from a value standpoint. They have a great dividend and theyre not going anywhere. This company does pose the most risk in my opinion though due to Biden as president. They are notorious for pollution. But I do believe that they are very beaten down and stand to benefit from rising commodity prices. They also have a deal with fuel cell which I actually didn't really know about until earlier today. Nifty. 

4, albemarle, not really a great value stock especially how much it's risen this year, but I'm a fan of albemarle moving forward. They are a bit on the speculative side and pose some risk as they are ramping up on lithium supply and I think that can lead to them having surplus which won't be good for lithium prices medium term. But I like that their numbers so I decided to throw it in here. I bought them before I knew about the dilution and I could've gotten them for a discount today, but I'm not too upset seeing as they are paying down debt. 

5, sibanye-stillwater, I like them, I posted about palladium and platinum here the other day. They go hand in hand with ev cars exept I hate the ev car stocks right now, so I figured this would be safer exposure. And they do gold as well, solid little mining company. I do like their CEO as well, I looked up some interviews and he seems like he is leading them in a good direction overall. 

I'm a huge fan of the industrials and energy stocks for this year and I think with our economy getting back on its feet, we should see solid growth in these sectors. I love doing dd on stocks that add sure value rona portfolio as well as growth potential, if you have any input or suggestions let me know and I'll be sure to investigate them myself!

I have been a long AMZN investor for past 7 years and mainly because of bezos and how he operates as a startup company even after all these years. They had a stellar quarter and solid guidance for next quarter. But his departure news are troubling for future growth. Are they going to stagnant? The stock didn't move today makes me wonder that other people are also sceptical.

Going forward, what is the bullish case beside AWS. Its funny that I never asked myself that question previously when Bezos was on the steering wheel. I guess bald man was full just of surprises.

I think I am just looking for some confirmation bias so I don't end up selling. Was hoping to put some on NFLX and TSM by selling half my AMZN position._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ FUBO could squeeze shorts 
[link to article and charting](https://houndermedia.com/fubo-could-get-the-squeeze/)

As shown by AMC and GameStop, bears have been getting shlonged. The idea behind taking a position in FUBO is quite simple: We're gonna squeeze shorts.

Not only does this play fit the theme of short squeezing that has been going on, but this is also a technical and fundamentally sound trade (not a financial advisor by the way). FuboTV is now the second-most shorted name in the US, behind GameStop. S3 Managing Partner Ihor Dusaniwsky's short interest in FUBO stock is now $1.7 billion, or 67.08% of the float, a 27% increase in two days.  I'm not saying it'll be the next Gamestop-like squeeze, but it has the potential to be epic.

Q4 total revenue is expected to be between $94-$98 million, a 77% to 84% increase year-over-year. Prior expectations were $80-$85 million.
Paid subscribers at year-end are expected to exceed 545,000, in increase of more than 72% year-over-year. Before it was 500,000-510,000 subscribers.
They will continue to be focused on executing their growth strategies, which include continuing to grow advertising revenues, working to implement sports wagering and further establishing FuboTV as a sports and live streaming service.
The fastest growing live-streaming platform with a revenue growth rate of 84% and a SuperBowl catalyst. People are going to be watching that game on Fubo and they'll probably have a commercial on too.
Closed an offering of $350m on January 16th, Disney owns 10% and there are Roku/Spotify investors on the Board of Directors.

David Einhorn recently revealed his Greenlight Capital was an early FuboTV investor, and he sees a bright future for the company where it can separate itself rather than directly compete, with traditional sportsbook operators.

I’m long FUBO._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ One thing hesitant about BB(Blackberry) So this may sounds very crazy to lot of people here, but when I pick up any tech stocks, one thing I check is "glassdoor" reviews from employees. I know it's stupid, but as myself also working in tech industry, I personally believe company cultures do take some roles in driving the company itself.

Looking at reviews on BB, I see lot of people complaining of bureaucracy and hard to get approved for anything. Also see multiple reviews mentioning lack of understanding of sales/marketing from management. I personally was also once employed at a company similar to that environment and I saw lot of smart people leaving company eventually. It's usually the old protocols / 'policies' among middle managments that messes up these  things, and it's really hard to shake it up.

Again those reviews on Glassdoor could be just bunch of laid off former employees dissing their former employer but if what the reviews say is true, it's a bit worrisome to me.

Their products look phenomenal and I do see lot of positives going forward related to their products, but that possible toxic culture is my only concern about getting into BB stock for long term hold.

I just lost a lot of money with GME. Surprisingly I am new to this game especially to active trading. 
I recently saw Gamestop moving past 50 but didn't understand why but didn't bother either. When it hit 200 I started reading about it.
What should I say FOMO hit me hard... 
I dreamt of making 2k in ONE DAY!  So I decided to gamble. I knew that this was not *investing*. WSB was full with things like gamma squeeze and Volkswagen/Blue Apron squeeze (later the short ladder) they backed all this up with nice charts. 
To be honest I didn't quite understand those things which kind of embarrassed me. I spent the whole night browsing YouTube and WSB.
Before going to bed I told myself to buy 2 shares right in the morning after market opening. 

My Plan: Buy 2 shares and watch the chart all day at separate screen to see a potential sell off point.

I was so tired in the morning that I kept sleeping instead of buying at 230€ (I wanted to be fully awake while I invest so I snoozer it).

When I as awake I tried to buy it but my broker said there were problems with Tradegate so they didn't let me. I was sitting in front of my screen and watching the stock go up 100€ in a matter of minutes (okay 1-2 hours) without being able to buy it. Then FINALLY at 400 I could buy it.
I bought it at the peak. The worst thing I could do...
Minutes later zi realized my broker restricted trade just like RH and the stock dropped. WSB screamed HOLLLD so I held. 

Now I feel like the squeeze squeeze when I bought at 400. Those short ladder attacks etc probably don't exist.

Maybe I should just stick with my ETFs they are boring but they have a good gain/risk ratio. This was a very good lesson to me. I am grateful that I just spent a "relative small amount" of money instead of those YOLO posts with 100% portfolio.

I don't see gamestop doing an actual comeback so holding those stocks is pretty useless without a squeeze, right? I heard something about averaging your price/loss out over the following months? Is that a reasonable thing to do?

TLDR: I am down 653,32€. Buy in at 400 with 2 shares. This is my first real loss. Should I bail out and take the loss or hold? Do you think there will a second squeeze at for example 200ish? When is a good time to sell?

Coherus Biosciences stock (CHRS)

Synopsis: Coherus Biosciences is the leading biologics platform company solely focused on delivering high-quality biosimilar therapeutics that will expand patient access to life-changing medicines in regulated markets worldwide. 

Current price: 17.27 

Market cap: small cap 1.24b

Growth type: LONG (6-18 months)

Why I like this stock:

In short: Small cap stock with large growth potential and solid financials.

 CHRS is the leading company dedicated to development and sale of biosimilar drugs. 
What are biosimilar drugs? These are protein therapeutics which have already been released to the market, however their 20yr patent has expired. These drugs differ from small molecule “generics” (ibuprofen is an example of a small molecule generic), in that they require FDA approval before release.  

As a PhD candidate in Cell and Molecular Biology I have intimate knowledge of biological literature and concepts (However, I am not a Medical Doctor and do not have intimate knowledge of the clinical sales of these products or distribution), I believe biosimilar drug manufacturing companies occupy a unique sphere in the market where they provide strong competition to companies that initially patented and developed these drugs but benefit from limited competition from other manufacturers due to FDA approval. 

CHRS revenue is currently the product of only one biosimilar that has been approved for sale. CHRS currently has 3 additional biosimilars in phase 3 clinical trials. Including a humira biosimilar, which in 2019 raked in over 19.73 billion in sales. The timeline for these drugs has not been made public but because they are copies of drugs which have already been approved by the FDA, there is little doubt that they will have any issue with approval.

Arguments For this stock:

1)	Currently cash positive with only one drug on the market.
2)	3 more biosimilar drugs on the way (large growth opportunity)
3)	Value stock with good P/E, Book value, and solid EPS.
4)	High operating profit margin even with only one drug to market and cost to bring others currently in development.
5)	Fiscally responsible management with lots of cash on hand. 

Arguments against this stock
1)	Stock has been stagnant since IPO.
2)	Competition from larger biotech companies could slow growth.
3)	Earnings year over year has not significantly increased

Rebuttals
1)	I believe the initial IPO had already priced in the suspected success of this company and the very successful release of their first drug met expectations. However, with 3 more drugs on the way I believe there is incredibly strong growth potential looking into the next 3 years.
2)	Competition from larger companies like Amgen does put a slow on growth prospects, but the limited ability for other companies to get into the market does limit further competition looking into the future. 
3)	Earnings are a reflection of growth but when it comes to biotechs and dealing with the FDA, companies are on a different timeline compared to other fast-moving sectors. I think within three years this company’s revenue will grow.

Sunpower is one of the leading Solar installation/manufacturing/battery storage companies in the 
hugely growing industry. Thank old Joe!

Just google “top solar companies” and tell me which have the best product and best customer ratings.

Sunpower is currently at a peak of a year long run up and now is nearly 60% available shares shorted. 

What most people don’t know, is, that Sunpower has started to roll out a new product that will consume market share from everyone’s favorite, Tesla. The product is called SunVault. SunVault is an energy storage battery that very well competes and rivals the Tesla power wall. I believe that SunVault will sell extremely well and could bring Sunpower up to Tesla levels in terms of solar and energy storage. The product is capable of powering your home for nearly 3 days. And when combined with the high efficiency panels that Sunpower offers, it’s game changing. 

SunVault only started rolling out last summer and Solar doesn’t really pick up till the summer. So getting in now before the busy season may be advantageous.

If you are looking for a company that is fundamentally strong and has a high upside in a huge market, SPWR really could be something to consider.

Online private health insurance marketplace aiming to simplify the healthcare buying process for medicare/Medicaid, family, and small business plans. Company has over 170 insurance plans available.

Leadership:

CEO – Scott Flanders – on since 2016. Previous playboy CEO (2009-2016). Freedom communications (06-09).

COO – Dave Francis – 25 years in healthcare market research

Derek yung – CFO – CFO at hotwire and others, prior.

Markets/offerings (what the fuck do they do?):

·         Health insurance market place for seniors, small business and family/personal (ACA and short term)

Financials (pending q4 2020 results feb):

·         Assets: 960K

·         Debt: 86k

·         Revenue growth (19-20): 34% (strong growth)

·         Profit: -14,000

The Stock (EHTH @ 50/share)

·      P/E: -44 (company loses money every year)

·         EBITDA: -22.4MM

·         Average analyst price target ~ $125/share

·         Competitors in the market are almost all over 100/share with billions in revenue

 

 

 

 

 

 

Whats the market look like?:

These guys deal with mostly medicare/Medicaid plans per their presentation. Biden opening healthcare.gov (was closed by trump). So that takes away most of their ACA group. 65+ population will double by 2030 (9 years) with many being tech savvy. It’s a matter of where they will buy their health insurance. Articles online state that seniors are frustrated with how difficult it is to find and compare healthcare plans (ehealth solves this).

 

 

What are the C-suite doing?

Last purchase of stock was august 2020 by CEO and Chief Digital Officer. Small amount.

 

Overall impression:

EHTH seems to be regarded as a growth stock, by many analysts with target of 120’s/share. They don’t offer a lot of products in a fairly diluted market. Seems the future of the companys growth lies in the upcoming silver wave of boomers entering medicare eligibility which is an effective doubling of the market.

The management team is pretty strong with experienced people in their key positions. The CEO worries me however as he was previously with playboy. During the period of 2009 to 2016, playboy didn’t exactly 180 and go gang busters. They actually went private and up for sale.

I'm doing an undergrad in computer science, I'm interested in tech/gaming, and my stock picks tend to reflect those things.

I'm wondering if I should rebalance or invest more in index funds rather than individual stocks.

# Portfolio:

* **Nio** (23.13%): It's a high percentage for a pretty speculative stock, but I've been riding it up since 16.50, avg. buy-in is \~22 (up 159%), I'm still bullish and I have no rebalancing strategy  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ The simplified reasons I bought are: **1)** EVs are the future **2)** Seems to have good backing from the CCP **3)** Everything I can find about the quality of the vehicles is very positive **4)** Not competing with the likes of Tesla because the whole industry is set for massive growth **5)** I think they're doing a good job at expanding production

&#x200B;

* **Crypto** (23%): **I know it's against the rules to discuss so I'm excluding specifics. I just wanted to include to give a better idea of my portfolio.** ^(0.11 BTC, 1.21 ETH)

&#x200B;

* **ARKG** (15%): Fairly recent investment (avg buy-in is 97.90, now it's 107.20) I don't have a great bullish argument because I know very little about Genomics, but I read a bunch of high-level stuff about how the technology has potential to cure certain diseases and be used cosmetically. I'm not a big fan of managed funds, but I figured ARK could pick companies better than an index fund could, since the field is so new. (Input on this would be appreciated)

&#x200B;

* **INTC** (8.25%): I bought in November at 45.84 (now 57.68 thanks to news of the new CEO) AMD is clearly winning the CPU war right now, but I felt that there's plenty of room for CPU growth (esp. with work-from-home and the processor shortage that COVID has given us) and that Intel can make a comeback if it gets its shit together. Seems they're making some effort to do that.

* **SQ** (8.15%): Bought at 178 (now 228) Not a lot to say. All the regular stuff, but also their Crypto play must be doing well with all the growth of Bitcoin recently, and I'm thinking their small-business tap-to-pay things might see more use in 6-12 months when (knock-on-wood) Covid is mostly gone.

&#x200B;

* **AMD** (7.67%): Everyone knows the bullish case. They're dominating CPU, they're competitive with GPUs now too, etc.

&#x200B;

* **MSFT** (3.86%): I'm kind of surprised it's a low percentage of my portfolio; maybe I'll buy more. Very stable company, it's like the gold of tech stocks. But there's plenty of future growth to expect: Azure, Xbox Gamepass, Teams, PowerApps. As well as the whole monopoly on good operating systems.

&#x200B;

* **Others** (<3%): **ICLN**(2.5%), **SNE**(2.2%), **IVV**(1.5%), **VUN**(1.3%), **QQQ**(1.3%), **WMT**(1.1%) **|** A lot of these picks were stupid buys at the beginning of my buying stocks, and they were small purchases because I hadn't worked up the confidence to put any significant amount of money in stocks. I might liquidate most of these (not ICLN), but for now I kind of just ignore them.

# Might buy soon:

* **BB**: I might put some money into BB soon, as it dips post-GME-frenzy. The bullish argument seems good to me. I'm just not sure what is a good price to buy in.

&#x200B;

* **RBLX**: I'm glad that they've opted for a direct offering instead of an IPO, so retail can get an okay price. I'm bullish just because they have a remarkable business model, where they profit off of users' creation. Their revenue growth is a testament to that. I always thought of roblox as a fad game, but it's really not, they've had so much growth in user-base in the last year (90M monthly 2019 to 150M monthly 2020) and most users are spending money on Robux so they can pay other users for new game modes, cosmetics, items, etc.. It's essentially a game-engine inside a game, marketed to teenagers.

&#x200B;

* I'm also keeping about the amount of 30% of my portfolio in cash just-in-case of a big 2021 pullback. In that case, I'll likely just average it out into an S&P 500 ETF. Stock-picking has done me well in this crazy run-up over the last year, but I wouldn't trust myself in a bear market.

I didn't invest money I can't afford to lose thought I did put in a reasonable amount. I even convinced some other people to jump in with me believing it would be the next GME. Needless to say I have lost money but I still believe in the cause and I still think it will make money at least in the long run so I am currently holding.

The more I read, the more I believed in the cause. So first I want to talk about the things that have me convinced, although I know most of this comes from what people are referring to as 'an echo chamber':

* [black rock has gotten in the fray with a huge investment](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbagpn/2221_blackrock_discloses_owning_62m_shares_of_amc/),

* I keep seeing the [same sentiment thrown around of WHY](https://www.reddit.com/user/PalpitationSimilar67/comments/lar78f/amc_amcstock_hold/) we are doing this
* Accusations of short laddering and naked shorting I (Cant post YouTube link because mods) are thrown around, while others here say its actually just normal and people on WSB are being delusional
* On top of this we get to stick it to the hedge funds during a time when wealth inequality is unparalleled in the country, what's not to like?
* I actually do believe in this stock I think theatres will come back after the vaccine and their reopening.

As someone completely new and here during an unprecedented time, this is alot to take in for me.

I began to realize just how many people believe in this, and was kinda dumb struck when I realized they might all be being played. Myself included. Next I want to talk about the reasons I feel like I should worry:

* GME and AMC fell off a cliff on Monday. Are people really losing interest? It seems to me like the movement is gaining momentum. What IS going on? Is it *really* market manipulation?
* A reddit post from here earlier today, talking about the SEC was investigating people. Not anyone from WSB, [but someone who may have used the frenzy to manipulate people on social media](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lbyve5/clarifying_the_secs_investigation_of_social_media/).

(WIX)? Hi everyone, first post here. Pardon any imprecise technical slang. I have been considering buying some WIX shares lately, @ 270ish.

My thoughts about the company are that no-code SaaS still have a great amount of market to expand into.

I'm a developer, and I think services like WIX and Webflow address a current problem with no-code or low-code CMS. Note that **a big** share of institutional websites and small e-commerces are built under Wordpress or Woocommerce. This is a 20-year old technology that, although proven, it is very difficult to scale without some IT investment (or at least stacking dollars to pay for hosted solutions like WPEngine, etc).

&#x200B;

^((Small note from a technical standpoint, this is not just some bashing on Wordpress, I have seen successful enterprise level cloud-based Wordpress implementations, but these are hard to pull through for a great amount of developers. Wordpress stands as the odd one out in the context of cloud-computing, and data-streaming of the 2020s —less and less SaaS provide PHP SDKs, etc— coming from a PHP developer).)

&#x200B;

Services like WIX could in my opinion attract a lot of customers who want to be able to rapidly prototype and scale with low-code solutions, without even purchasing hosting.

&#x200B;

Now on 2020 they receded back a bit from a 2x growth that I missed in 2019. (I bought their stocks but sold afterwards to pursue other assets instead, huge mistake). But because of the above I would expect that they will continue to grow.

Some things that I see as a positive outlook:

I've checked their [SEC filings and the last K-6](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1576789/000117891321000017/zk2025303.htm) shows a big $300 million worth of share repurchasing, which might indicate the company considers it's undervalued, right?

Glassdoor indicates that WIX is presenting an elevated amount of hires, also.

They also re-branded their Velo service which allows developers to code custom on-site JS interactions with the WIX API and CMS.

Analysts on Yahoo finance also predict an average target price of 310, with maximums of 360 (also a minimum of 200), but the average recommendation is between Buy and Strong buy, and many of them expecting WIX to outperform its Q4 2020 expectations.

&#x200B;

[Now WIX is presenting its Q4 2020 results on February 17th](https://investors.wix.com/events). I expect that it will get it closer to target predictions from its current 277.

&#x200B;

So what do you think of WIX? Do you see any issues with it? Any help is very much appreciated._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Can someone explain to me what is actually happening when brokers have a liquidity/capital issue and restrict trades? Obviously this is related to recent Gamestop events and the decision of several brokers to freeze buying.

I found the explanations by the brokers really odd. I listened to RH founders clubhouse talk and I didn't really understand how they could have an issue with capital that forced them to restrict buying.

Can someone explain how valid their reason is? As someone who doesn't understand it, it currently sounds like B.S. 

If they had capital issues and couldn't allow buying of one stock with a few billion dollars market cap, how do they process billions of dollars of buys for other stocks daily, with no issues?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Roconciling paying capitol gains taxes this year Disclaimer: I pay my taxes and am not suggesting in any way that anyone shouldn't. 

So I got roped into a certain stock craze and as a direct result of broker BS lost out on a lot of gains and took some significant losses. I knew the nominal risks, although the events that caused me issues were not normal.

What I am distinctly frustrated about is that said broker locked down my account as I transferred money out and wouldn't allow me to sell when it was clear it was going south which cost me about 12k of input and 12k of gains. Additionally their blocking purchasing prevented me from dumping 50k in at the first dip which I fully intended to sell when it doubled as I did not want to hold that much. I was intending to play it safe and take profit, but I was directly barred from doing so. 

That said, my portfolio lost 12k of actual and 112k of potential and the SEC sat on their asses. I am having a really hard time mustering the energy to spend a significant chunk of my free time over the next few weeks tallying what will essentially be a net zero for the year. All while the people who cost me will pay barely any taxes at all. 

I am really frustrated every time I see an SEC fee on a trade, and I am getting increasingly frustrated with paying taxes on an income that is only viable becasue I work 60 hours a week and do okay on the stock market. (this will be a bad year) 

It just all feels like being kicked while I'm quite down and very much so feels like taxation without representation. 

Rant over!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Discussion - will blockchain replace stock markets? I've been curious... I'll be 50 this year, retired at 47, love investing in the markets and have been doing pretty well.  I wish I would have started early and never worked (I owned hotels and rental properties, such hard work), and wish I never bought a house and just airbnb'd through life.  I've been watching everything that's happening in relation to 4IR - the 4th Industrial Revolution - and find a lot to be really fascinating.  Whether it is AI, automation, DeFi, blockchain, 3D printing, robotics, ghost kitchens, dark stores, work-from-anywhere, shared homes/cars, self-driving, etc., I just think we're about to see a lot happening and won't go into all that fascinates me there, I'll keep this to stocks.

So... if a company goes public to raise capital then what happens if there are better, cheaper methods to raise capital through blockchain decentralized finance?  Wouldn't it make more sense to start moving in this direction, and keep more of your company for yourself while not giving as much away to public investors?  Are we headed in this direction, and if so, would there be any reason for the current market models to exist?  If no stock markets existed, would this create more or less class division? Perhaps that rests on the structure of the company and there could be more wage equality?
