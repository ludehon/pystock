Look at carrier and Otis. Once freed from United Technologies they was able to blow like rockets. These giant conglomerates need so much revenue to achieve growth that it’s practically impossible. Compare JNJ to a compatriot when it was founded ACU. Acme United is focused mostly on office, first aid, and cutting equipment with a market cap under 100M. It’s very easy to grow 10% only needing 10M. On the other hand JNJ would need to earn tens of billions to achieve similar growth. By breaking up into smaller companies they could more easily focus on growing as smaller companies and focusing on individual businesses which would release shareholder value.

I'm currently helping a buddy build his own, custom dividend-based investing strategy. In doing so we need to get data for various figures obviously - some, specifically for 'relative comparison's' sake. Specifically, we're wanting to grab data for other entities (not the company itself), in which to compare the values (vs. the company itself)... 

Consider these notes, which list the data for other entities that we want to grab, so far...

    other entity info
    	10yr treasury yield
    	industry average...
    		1. div payout ratio
    		2. Net Debt to EBITDA Ratio
    		3. div yield
    	peers' [similar companies; competitors; etc] average...
    		1. div payout ratio
    		2. Net Debt to EBITDA Ratio
    		3. div yield
    		4. PE ratio [adjusted]
    	index's average...
    		1. div payout ratio
    		2. PE Ratio [adjusted]

So for example, lets consider company ticker "SYY." We'll of course want to get dividend yield for the company... OK, np! Thats easy. The same could be said - more or less - about any specific data-point, for any one company (that stuff's also easy to find). When it comes to the data for OTHER entities, thats where it gets difficult (hence,  this post).

# Lets pretend YOU wanted to get SYY's..

# 1. INDUSTRY average div payout ratio

# 2. PEER/COMPETITORS' average div payout ratio

# 3. INDEX's average div payout ratio

# What would you do? Where would go to get that? Basically, what would the process be in your case, for attempting to find the answers to those 3 questions? 

PS - I'm HOPING you guys might know of a site or something that would just 'spit this out,' as a single number (so i only have to grab ONE data point, rather than a list of a bunch of data points, to then use as i manually calculate these figures). Not that i mind the manual calculations' process, its just that were going to try gathering data for various companies in a google sheet FIRST (but getting too complex in the sheets - such as grabbing 99824982 data points via importxml() formulas, just to calculate a single number - can quickly start to overload its capabilities, forcing us to resort to some other, less than ideal solution (ie- python script or something), so its best if i can just grab that single number, pre-calculated already, on the web somewhere). The friend who im helping \[create this project with\] is not familiar with programming, so sticking to gsheets - again - is ideal; so its important that i remember to minimize the number of importxml formulas, as much as possible. I hope this "PS-" section is making sense, but if not... pretend you didnt read it and just stick to the part i wrote above, in huge letters lol

Uranium stocks surging after Senate funding measure

Nov. 11, 2020 2:46 PM ETCameco Corporation (CCJ)By: Carl Surran, SA News Editor

Shares of uranium companies are on the rise after the U.S. Senate Committee on Appropriations released drafts of FY 2021 funding measures and subcommittee allocations which include $150M for the U.S. Uranium Reserve.

Cameco CCJ +4.6% after rising as much as 7% intraday; also,UUUU +3.4%, URG +6.1%, UEC +2.8%, NXE +2.1%, OTCQX:FCUUF +3.8%, OTCPK:URPTF +0.6%, but DNN -1.4%.

"If passed, this bill will enable [the Department of Energy] to begin the funding required to stimulate growth in the domestic uranium mining industry," Uranium Energy CEO Amir Adnani says. "The U.S. nuclear industry provides ~55% of the nation's carbon-emission free electricity, with the world'a largest reactor fleet of 96 operable reactors.

According to Bloomberg, Eight Capital analyst David Talbot calls the measure "historic," given that measure would provide full funding for the DoE to purchase 1.7M-1.9M lbs. of uranium for the U.S. reserve.

P/E ratio investing, often called 'value investing' makes for lazy research because it pretends that 90% of all the research you ever need to conduct is summed up by this emotionless number. The tl;dr is that P/E is an imaginary unitless arbitrary number, it captures nothing qualitative about a company.

The idea that low P/E ratios inevitably mean a bargain buy is silly. Lets look at an example, nvidia and ebay. In early March 2020 their P/E was around 5. If you had invested 1,000 dollars you would now have 1,210 dollars which isnt too bad.

Lets look at nvidia. in March 2020 their P/E was approximately 50 or so. Ten times that of ebay and according to P/E fanatics an outrageous buy compared to the 'bargain' of ebay. If you had invested 1,000 dollars in March you would now have around 1,895 dollars. Outperforming ebay by 56%.

Lets extend that timeline for all the people that may argue "over long periods of time P/E will show".

That 1,000 dollars invested ten years ago would now be:

Ebay: $4,192.79

Nvidia: $43,658.11

The reason why P/E ratios completely fail is because they take no qualitative information into account. They don't account for things like facebook market place and craigslist peeling away ebay users. Or the pivoting of nvidia from purely videogaming to everything from smart phones and cars all the way to super computers.

&#x200B;

P/E makes for lazy research. Lets take a look at some Value Investing ETF's:

[https://money.usnews.com/investing/slideshows/the-10-best-etfs-for-value-investors?slide=2](https://money.usnews.com/investing/slideshows/the-10-best-etfs-for-value-investors?slide=2)

The best ETF on this list is WisdomTree U.S. Large Cap Dividend ETF (DLN). At a listed 10.6% return per year over the last decade. Lets compare that to FXAIX, the Fidelity S&P500 tracking ETF: Their ten year is listed at 13.73% where the S&P500 itself is listed at 13.74%.

So the conclusion is that the **best** value investing ETF that I could find with two minutes of google searching is worse then an S&P500 tracker. You could likely pick stocks at random and outperform a value investing fund.

Lets look at a great fund, my personal favorite is QQQ. QQQ has returned 20.15% over the last 10 yrs, 23.36% over 5 yrs, and 48.25% 1 yr. Earning it the rare coveted bragging right of consistently and significantly beating the index. Absolutely trashing DLN which has returned 0.78% 1 yr.

PEG is even worse by the way. What does growth have any relation to P/E? Its like saying 'the next car you buy should be faster then your weight." Yeah sure that would make for a fast car but how are they related?

&#x200B;

The alternative is unfortunately to perform real research. Read financial statements, understand some more significant ratios like current, quick, ROA, etc...

&#x200B;

And most importantly. Companies and their accountants know that lazy investors prefer ratios, they are easy to calculate easy to understand. They will abuse these ratios by manipulating the denominators more then the numerators. Buying back shares will decrease the P/E ratio making the company seem better. But is that company actually selling more products, building more factories, inventing new hardware to build up a moat? No they are not. So their P/E is more appealing but reflects no improvement to the business.

See news in Chinese for context -- it sounded really ugly.

&#x200B;

1. Yahoo etc say "Alibaba Singles Day Sales (aka 11:11, Nov 11) Hit Record High $75 Billion"

Really? Check this out...

"Worst Nov 11 (China's equivalent of "Prime Day/Black Friday") in history: Jack Ma & buddies LOST $2 trillion in 2 days" [https://finance.sina.com.cn/tech/2020-11-11/doc-iiznezxs1326859.shtml](https://finance.sina.com.cn/tech/2020-11-11/doc-iiznezxs1326859.shtml) ... Google for more (in Chinese of course). *NB: Yahoo and Wall Street have a stake in Alibaba?*

Google using Chinese characters 马云 =  Jack Ma = Mǎ Yún (马云)

Keypoint: Authority deliberately imposed many restrictions on labeling and  what can be sold on Alibaba's Taobao on Nov 11... To understand this strategy, read "China tightens restrictions on Australian exports" [https://apnews.com/article/virus-outbreak-beijing-global-trade-australia-south-china-sea-ea95bc519eb9bf40172edc626caf5537](https://apnews.com/article/virus-outbreak-beijing-global-trade-australia-south-china-sea-ea95bc519eb9bf40172edc626caf5537) ... same thing.

2. You must have heard of "China drafts new antitrust guideline to rein in tech giants" by now. What's the big deal? US and the west did the same thing, nothing happened.

Well, you must have forgotten conviction rate in China is literally 99.99%. That's the difference.

3. Ant Financials IPO - The politics behind the suspension isn't something Joe can understand.

First, the timing - why IPO suspended on the eve of the debut? This is directly due to the 5th China Communist Party plenum that ended just before Jack Ma & co were told their $3 trillion Ant Financials IPO was suspended.

Clue: No heir apparent as Xi Jinping reveals top leadership.

Still wondering what's happening? Here > The Boss wanna make sure all parties are obsessed with the world's largest IPO, happy, and create no trouble during the party plenum, which is the "Bilderberg" of China that may give birth to China's new leader (*against Xi Jinping who wanna rule forever*)

Second, non-bank money-lending is considered loan-sharking no matter how hard you try masqurade the sin as "fintech" -- no different from trying to bypass the Fed with any other form of money (just google what happened to those who tried...). This is not to say China is shutting down Ant Financials becos Jack Ma created a new cryptocurrency, it's becos Ant's microlending is seen as a timebomb for CCP.

How so? Google keywords like "China P2P Lending Suicide Scandal", you'd see why did China cracked down the so called hitech "P2P Lending" industry that left behind nothing good except social ills like suicides, bankruptcies, etc (many still listed as pennystocks on NASDAQ like KXIN, WEI, etc. -- all were given 2 years to wind down and do something else)... Ant Financials is no difference for CCP believes Jack Ma & co. will leave behind the same mess so big that it may collapse the CCP.

You see?

Plus, big-mouthed Jack Ma actually told this guy [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wang\_Qishan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wang_Qishan) that China regulators are dinosaur that neither understand nor capable of regulating "fintech".

tl;dr: Jack Ma is history -- He has been personally targeted to send out a clear message: "Who's The Boss" (just like why Trump fired Esper the other day). "Xi Jinping going after Jack Ma's head" [https://www.soundofhope.org/post/439876](https://www.soundofhope.org/post/439876)

I've always found eBay to have an interesting business model. The company has a great brand and a unique business model, but the stock had been struggling in the last 5 years (+68% vs +431% for PayPal) and the P/E sits below 7. 

This should be a stock people flock to in a recession and also in a more eco-friendly era with second hand items being cool again. With other similar business models such as Etsy doing so well, why the tough love for eBay? 

Some numbers:
It generates $11.8 bil in revenues and more than $3.7 EBITDA, with above $2 bil. in Free Cash Flow and is not hugely in debt at $8.2 bil.

They’re also sitting on $3.7 bil. in cash, so they could bankroll a few startups and try to find the next PayPal. Is there a lack of leadership/vision to do so? 

Or does it simply come down to the potential for growth being limited, with a mature business model not scalable further? Does their business model simply lack opportunities to develop in new areas, since that they’ve spun off PayPal? Or is it the instability in the earnings that the market is discounting?

[I found this video interesting by Meet Kevin.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPVdOtieC48) I am not trying to publicize it, but wanted to discuss what his argument was. The summary of his video is as follows:


* The Vanguard study comparing DCA (Dollar Cost Averaging) vs Lump Sum investing was flawed. The flaw is that Vanguard assumed 12 month DCA periods and did not consider shorter DCA periods.

* Even with this flaw, the ending portfolio balance difference between DCA and Lump Sum was only 1-2%. 

* Kevin suggests shorter DCA periods of 4-8 weeks, specifically buying on days when the market is red, claiming that this strategy would more than make up for the 1-2% difference observed by Vanguard

* He also noted the psychological aspect of market dips, basically that it feels good to buy on red days. By lump sum investing all at once, you rob yourself the opportunity to get the feeling of being able to buy on red days as they occur, and instead are left with watching your portfolio drop without being able to partake in the dip._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Alibaba boasts over $70 billion sales as first post-virus Singles' Day nears end https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-singles-day-alibaba/alibaba-boasts-56-billion-sales-as-post-virus-singles-day-gets-into-full-swing-idUKKBN27Q2HX

Imagine investing in a company that ALREADY has an excess of $100 Million in backlog orders, which is the equivalent to its market CAP.

They will be releasing earnings mid month.

**Potential 3 to 5 bagger in the 12 to 18 months I feel. Ammo prices are through the roof right now.**

Thoughts?

Now, does this mean that this is the interest rate at which today's government bonds were issued? Or is this the average yield on outstanding government bonds based on their market value? 

The way I usually think about rates and yields is that governments issue new bonds at a certain rate, and this affects the supply and demand of previously issued bonds due to favourable or unfavourable interest rate on them. This change in supply and demand causes a change in the market price paid for those bonds, effectively changing the yield on them. I'm not sure if I'm thinking of the entire concept the right way though. 

Using the example of 10yr Canadian govt bonds, today the rate is 0.82, and yesterday it was 0.64. Does this mean that today's newly issued government bonds had an interest rate of 0.82, or does this mean that the market value of already-issued bonds dropped a bit, thus increasing their effective yield?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ What is your favourite small-cap long-term holding that is ripe for hype? Please elaborate and don't just throw out tickers... You know how there are some stocks that you go, "Geez, looking back now that was so fricken obvious..."

I want to hear about those holdings where you are thinking:

"I can't believe there isn't that much hype around this yet."

"I can't wait for 20 years down the road for this to take off."

"This is most confident investment, I could care less about the swings"

Currious to hear your thoughts! And thank you!

*Small or mid-cap welcome*_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Is it a good time to invest in Ultra Cold Freezer manufacturers? Given the fact that Pfizer's vaccine needs to be stored in an ultra-cold freezer, I'm anticipating a huge demand from the whole world to store the vaccine safely during transportation and at hospitals.

I'm I missing something in here? I checked in some of the trusted sources, CVS and other organizations are already placing orders for these freezers.  


Google Trends also show a demand.

Something seems kinda weird here. If there were in need of cash enough to IPO, why are they doing a share buyback so recent unless they really needed that cash but only in that \~3 month period in which case, wouldn't a loan have been better and more efficient?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Thoughts on the Pfizer Vaccine and the Potential Logistical Issues? Potential Stocks to Benefit from the Strict Temperature Requirement? As Pfizer, Moderna and many other pharmaceutical companies make progress developing a vaccine for COVID-19, it seems likely that one will become available to the general public soon.  I am curious how something like this could be transported due to the -80 Celsius (-112 Fahrenheit) temperature requirement. Is anyone aware of logistical companies or cold storage companies that could handle this kind of demand?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ What has been your best investment/trade to date ?
