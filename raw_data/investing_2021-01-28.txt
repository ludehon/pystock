I seek out the reddit forums for an answer that our fund has been looking for. We have been studying the correlation of the return of the 10yr treasury and the return of the SP500 in the presence of inflation. From 1980-2000, when inflation was relatively high, the 10yr treasury and the SP500 provided returns with a positive correlation. From 2000 to present, where inflation was lower, the 10yr treasury and the SP500 have had a negative correlation of returns. This means investors were able to use the 10yr as a hedge for their portfolio, providing safety if their equity holdings experienced a drawdown. My question to you all is, what caused the change in the correlation? Was it the switch from periods of higher inflation to lower? How should one use this info to prepare for the coming years, in terms of adding treasury protection to your portfolio, if inflation is expected to rise?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ I would like to point a portion of my portfolio at commodities like copper oil lithium silver gold etc. in expectation of a possible commodity supercycle during stagflation/reinflation.

Dubbed "Walmart Connect", Walmart is aiming to leverage all of the data it has access to in order to offer an omni-channel advertising experience in order for Brands to reach their shoppers!

https://corporate.walmart.com/newsroom/2021/01/28/walmart-announces-expanded-vision-and-new-name-for-its-media-business

In case anybody isn't aware, this is a HUGE source of revenue for Amazon and Walmart is finally stepping up to the plate. I think Walmart is a sleeper pick, and has huge potential. At worst, it continues to be a retailer where 90% of America shops at with slow growth in their ecommerce business... Solid stock either at worst. If they can pull their new vision off, this means $$$_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Reasons why CCIV might be the stock of 2021 1. There is too much evidence that suggests CCIV & LUCID will soon Merge. Both LUCID, CCIV and the Saudis are linked to each other in multiple ways. CCIV & LUCID also never denied that the companies will merge. If both companies were not going to merge then they would have said something because that would leave too many people too angry to reinvest into the company. Lucid Motors has now opened job vacancies for three new posts – SEC Reporting Manager, Director of Investor Relations, and Analyst, Investor Relations. 

2. LUCID was designed and made by engineers from TESLA. That will be a factor in retail investors. Also LUCID is the only real competitor to TESLA. No company comes close.

3. If we go by Tesla’s valuation then LUCID is worth Somewhere around $300 - $400 per share.

4. If Nikola can fly to $89 with no real product then LUCID can easily double that considering they have a vehicle that is about to Launch.

5. LUCID will be soon announcing 2 new vehicles sometime this year. https://www.lucidmotors.com/future-models

6. Lucid Motors is in negotiations to build a second production plant in the city of Jeddah, KSA. 

7. LUCID’s factory in Casa Grande, Arizona will be able to produce 400,000 vehicles a year. The facility measures 999,000 square feet, and Lucid plans to expand to a massive 5.1 million square feet by 2028.

8. The LUCID Air can be charged 300 miles in just 20 minutes. The LUCID Air can travel 517 miles on a full charge. The LUCID Air has the Car-to-Grid Bi-Directional Functionality. The car can literally power a house in a power outage.

9. LUCID Motors and Electrify America are partnering to give owners of the upcoming Air EV three years of complimentary charging.

10. The United States and some other countries are starting to go full blown EV. A huge percentage of the market is untapped. 

Down side at least for now: 
1. The the merger is temporarily “delayed” CCIV. 
2. This merger news is based on rumors.

This entire post represents my personal views and opinions, and should not be taken as financial advice (or advice of any kind whatsoever). I encourage you to do your own research, take anything I write with a grain of salt, and hold me accountable for any mistakes you may catch. Also, full disclosure, I hold a net long position in GME, but my cost basis is very low (average \~$45/share with my later buys averaged in), and I'm using money I can absolutely lose. My capital at risk and tolerance for risk generally is likely substantially different than yours.*

First, thank you everyone for the comments and questions on [my first post on this topic](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/l5l413/gamestop_big_picture_the_short_singularity/). Given the traffic and sheer volume of questions, I figured writing another post would be better (and actually something I can manage).

I wanted to focus this post on a few common themes I saw in the comments to the first post, as well as questions people were asking me directly, and related themes I saw on other posts and subs that I believe would be informative for this sub.

First, a simplified recap of the 1/27/2021 trading day as I saw it. The following is my interpretation of events, and may include personal opinions, assumptions, and outright errors. Apologies for the length, but I hope this helps some of the newer traders thinking about jumping into the water with these sharks. I honestly don't think that you should, but you make your own decisions. I'll just try to help provide some information to help if I can.

# Euro Market Hours: Retail Euphoria & The Setup

After-hours and Euro market activity rockets the stock in an essentially unbroken streak from \~$146 to $365. GME long social media is going ballistic.

Volume is too low. There is no sell-side pushback. Allowing consolidation at these prices would be a major setback for the short-side, yet they are doing nothing on volume they could easily push back.

I smell a rat. This is too easy.

# 5am Eastern: Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt (FUD)

If you ask most retail market participants about how quants with their algorithms, hedge funds with their trading strategies, sophisticated experienced traders, etc., conduct their operations, you will probably get responses about sophisticated programs and high frequency trading, fundamental analysis, risk hedging strategies, lots of math, etc. That is largely true, but it is critically incomplete. The most successful hedge fund managers also deeply understand that beneath the surface, the primal forces driving markets are fear and greed, and they know how to best leverage information asymmetry to play other investors--and especially retail investors--like fiddles.

As retail sentiment reaches fever pitch, Andrew Ross Sorkin gets a call from Melvin Capital just before the start of CNBC's Squawk Box, by far the most-watched pre-US market show and files a [breaking news alert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HYBo5teFTU) at the start of the show.

(Paraphrasing) Melvin Capital is out. They didn't go bankrupt but they came close and took a huge loss. Congratulations WSB, you've won and you've burned the house down, and now that the shorts are out this whole thing is going to crash and burn all the retail investors you dragged along with you.

"[Who's going to be left holding the bag](https://youtu.be/1HYBo5teFTU?t=146)?... uh, the thing that concerns me most, at this point, is whether **some of these investors will actually start to get out today**\--they'll look at this and say 'we won the game'--if that's winning, uhh unclear, you know, where the finish line is, uh in that regard, but uh, as much pain as they may have uh, created for Melvin Capital for example, umm, **my-my great anxiety at this point is the number of-of retail investors that have been jumping into this uhh.. in literally the last 24 hours who very well may get hurt, uh, far more, and lose far more than some of the hedge funds that were involved, uh in this**. Um, let's just show you where we are now..."

"**Where are the regulators**.. and is this just the beginning?"

Meanwhile, as if it had been choreographed and rehearsed, the Squawk Box team are outraged--absolutely outraged at what is going on, while a big graphic of GME price crashing off a cliff dominates 2/3 of the screen and social media is flooded with messages and posts skillfully crafted to stoke the fear.

In WSB, other subs, and other social media sites, dozens of bots start posting bogus messages purporting to mock the retail investors with messages like "Thanks for the free gainz retards!".

The fear is almost palpable coming through my monitor. People start trying to sell, then start asking why their market sell orders won't go through while they're watching a practically vertical dive on the GME chart next to Joe Kernan as he says "If you think there's speculation in crypto \[...\] and-and-**now they're looking for the next mark, right**? They'll-they'll find another Gamestop, once they're done with Gamestop, but **in the meantime, there's gonna be BLOOD**".

Congratulations Squawk Box--you beautifully played your part in engineering peak, nigh-hysterical fear among the less experienced retail investors, and basically shouted "FIRE!!!" in the market equivalent of a locked theater. I truly believe your feelings were sincere, and you truly do have concern for the retailers who have been and will be hurt in all of the volatility, but that made your actions all the more effective in driving many try to lock in losses. C'mon, you can do better--I've seen you do good work and am thankful for what you did getting good info out during the peak of the pandemic--please do some investigation before spreading only one side of the narrative handed to you by financially conflicted parties. You have analysts doing your background research--any of them could tell you the short interest in GME would take more than an entire trading day to unwind even if the buy-side of every single transaction that day was to close a short position and no new short positions were initiated. Also, any of them could tell you that it's unlikely Melvin Capital held 100% of all short interest in GME. Melvin leaving is not equal to all shorts being covered--and you didn't even get confirmation that Melvin actually covered! Get them to say it themselves on air rather than carrying their water and letting them ride on your reputation and providing cover from an SEC stock manipulation investigation.

Most retail brokerages don't open pre-market trading until around 7am. All those people could do was watch their positions bleed as GME plummeted over the remainder of the next 2 hours, hitting the floor of $182, nearly 50% down from the peak about 3 minutes before retail brokerages open pre-market trading.

Wow. I have to hand it to the short-side hedge funds. Some of your traders must have studied drama for their undergrad or something--that is almost perfect timing.

Almost, but not quite.

# Pre-Market Tears... of Joy and Relief

The engineered crash was probably intended to run right through the open of retail pre-market, with the idea of getting panicking retail to sell into the low liquidity environment for more violent downward price moves without the benefit of Limit Up/Limit Down halts, causing a stampede for the exits. Man, how many hours did you guys spend thinking this strategy up? I'm honestly impressed.

Two minutes prior to pre-market open, however, some deep conviction, deep pocket players, understanding the market mechanics and fundamentals behind the recent wild ride in GME started raking in the shares at discount prices they probably never thought they'd ever see again during this campaign. I'm sure tears of joy were shed, as they realized floor-to-close of regular trading gains of nearly 100%. Whoever you are, well played.

I would note here that those people could easily have waited for the engineered crash to drain the blood of the fearful retailers who would have punched out, which would have allowed them to lock in greater share volumes at even lower prices, but they stopped the crash early instead. I don't know if that was their intention, but a lot of retail people were probably saved because of that.

With the almost literally last-minute reversal, price rode green candles upward through the retail pre-market open, and many who would have despaired and punched out to lock in losses instead white-knuckled through the chop and held, with very bullish action through to the market open. Those who survived the day--good on you, I know it couldn't have been easy.

# Chamath

Let's let the man [speak for himself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iYh_mc26SU) (and speak up for retail). Well worth spending 30 minutes to watch if you have the time. I have to give Scott Wapner credit--he asks tough questions and he repeatedly brings on guests that he know will go toe-to-toe with him with the gloves off to ensure that there is a good, vigorous debate representing diverse viewpoints. Be on the right side of history big boy, lol.

Skirmishing continues at lower volume than the last 2 trading days. Bullish patterns everywhere--buying up on high volume, straggling down on low volumes. Liquidity is running out. Short-side is rationing, saving ammo for the end-of-day push.

# Shenanigans, End of Day, More Shenanigans

At various points throughout the day, levers are pulled to flush retail positions out by margin calling profitable accounts across many of the retail brokerage firms, changing margin requirements with no notice.

Short-side attacks coincide with ominous warnings on news media about potential regulator action, short-side touts spreading FUD across mainstream media.

Short-side's rationed insufficient shares to make meaningful progress on the last tick of regular trading. This is key, as prime brokers of highly levered players pay a lot of attention to the status of accounts at the end of regular trading each day.

After hours it looks like more retail traders are dumped out of their profitable portfolios due to margin change requirements--right into the abyss of super-low after-hours volume. Had their brokers at least liquidated their accounts toward the end of the main trading day into meaningful trading volume they would have gotten much better returns. Dumping them into no volume means the last few accounts took massive losses vs mark to end of trading day market price. Thank, you brokerages, for protecting those people from themselves. Hopefully they took lower profits vs being dumped into the red.

Some people see the diving ticker and panic again.

One thing that was particularly irritating to me is that people were all over CNBC multiple times a day, making outrageous claims of how retail traders were slamming risk into the market via leveraged trades even as the retail brokers changed their policies in realtime to disallow use of any margin in accounts holding GME, and dumped those retail traders out of their positions. I knew what kind of volatility to expect, so I had maintained a net cash position in my account ever since buying, just in case something like this happened--thank goodness.

# Technical Analysis for the Day

I wish this sub would allow charts, but I'll describe instead.

On the daily chart, RSI has been in an ascending channel since April '20(!), and rocketed to 98+(!!!) at the end of the trading day. Price is dislocating wildly higher every day for the past 4 days into descending volume.

My read of the chart is that it shows massive buy-side dominance into worsening sell-side weakness and lower liquidity. I read this as mind-meltingly, parabolically bullish, and something that would not be possible if not for the distortion of the supercritical mass of short interest, and I guess this is what a short squeeze looks like when you have access to all the data retail fintech can provide. The technicals tell me to expect massive volatility, but also that this is possibly the most asymmetrical risk environment imaginable.

I feel bad for the retail shorts that I know were out there. I saw a few posts about people taking short positions because Andrew Left got on TV and told them GME is going bankrupt, it's going back to $20, and he's an expert unlike you reddit amateurs, and by the way about 30 other experts followed and backed him up over the past few days. For this reason I'm glad that many of the retail brokerage firms have disallowed shorting GME and other volatile names. I hope they got out before their accounts got obliterated.

# Lessons Learned

I wondered what kind of things you might see when billions of dollars were on the line, and I have to say that the short-side guys know how to go all-in and pull surprise after surprise out of the hat. They are good at manipulating people, letting them build up euphoric feelings only to slam them in the face with nonstop fear. They do it in media, and they do it in sudden price-crushing rushes, slamming the ticker down to try to get weak hands to fold. As I stated earlier, I am trading deep in the money, on capital I can afford to lose, and even I can't avoid feeling it. I honestly don't know how some of you trading on borrowed money meant for next month's rent can handle it.

The short-side players are running out of ammo, but they don't just go toe-to-toe in the market--they'll blanket media and even flood your discord server, message board, and social media with well-coordinated bot attacks. You will face those moments of stark terror--they are good getting people to feel fear. If you're thinking of getting into this trade--please understand that before deciding whether to jump in. You might not think that a stock that's been going basically vertical could leave long-side casualties on the field, but believe it--fear and volatility can get you to zero your account (or worse!) in any environment.

# FAQs from the First Post (comments and messages)

(answers are my opinions only--do not take as financial advice. I've consolidated common themes.)

* **I'm afraid I'm missing out on a unique opportunity to make returns that could change my life trajectory in a positive way. Should I buy in at this point?**

First, each person decides on their own what trades they choose to make. However, I will say this: Fear is giving you this anxiety. Maximum FOMO is when you see green candles going up until the fear makes you punch the buy order in. Maximum despair and fear of life-altering losses hits peak during deep downward price movements, making you punch out to avoid losing your entire position. Fear makes you buy high and sell low. HFT houses are full of algorithms designed to exploit fear through the price movement, and find gaps in your risk mitigation strategy (e.g. stop-loss hunting algorithms, etc.). If fear is driving you to trade, I urge you not to swim in low-liquidity waters with sharks who specifically make their money exploiting fear.

* **I am a regular investor holding broad ETFs or mutual funds for my retirement. I do not actively trade, but I am concerned that what's happening here might impact the broader market, and maybe even my retirement account. Have you thought of that while you're having all this fun? What about systemic risk?**

You may be surprised to hear that I, and likely many others have thought quite a lot about these things. In fact, I hold about 75% of my capital in the same type of boring IRA and 401(k) accounts you're talking about, and I maybe rebalance them a few times a year and don't even check the balances regularly otherwise.

As for what kinds of impacts there may be--in all honestly, no one knows. Specifically, no one knows because no one knows exactly what the levered hedge funds involved hold, how they trade, etc. The massive short interest in GME is basically a deliberately engineered market distortion that is now blowing off, and distortions blowing off are always scary, and can spell financial damage or disaster for the unprepared.

That, however, is part of the market. To paraphrase Dr. King and Keynes, the arc of the market may be long (and longer than you can remain solvent), but it bends toward efficiency, given the right conditions. The US stock market is pretty good in this respect.

Now I won't deny that these hedge funds are run by smart people, but they occasionally get either arrogant or too clever for their own good and get caught. In GME they essentially voluntarily engineered themselves into a short squeeze entirely on their own while no one was even looking. In fact, the only way the trade works is if no one ever finds out and GME quietly goes bankrupt. In the meantime, a legitimate fundamentals-based turnaround story came to light and just lit the fuse. They’re crying now about being cornered, but they walked into that corner themselves, then dug themselves in so deep that the only way out was GME bankruptcy, and sat there for a year just assuming GameStop would go bankrupt while no one was paying attention and they’d take their free money and walk. If this doesn't make sense, and you have a free 20 minutes and tolerance for mild profanity, I suggest you watch this video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4EUbJcGoYQ4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4EUbJcGoYQ4)

Anyway, That being said, market "corrections" are aptly named, even if painful, because they are, in essence, corrections of various distortions in the market. The longer they go uncorrected, the harder, faster, and more drastic the move when it does happen--with usually worse consequences (see the 2008 financial crisis, which was a distortion 10+ years in the making before blowing off).

* **It looks like maximum gains on this trade would have started if you bought in at $4. Should I be looking for names at <$4 to find another opportunity like this? I heard some people made a lot of money on Hertz. Is this like Hertz?**

I have no idea. I wasn’t looking at Hertz at the time. Obviously it's different in that GME is not going bankrupt despite what some people on the news might say (honestly, I don't understand their apparent conviction on this given most of them profess to not even know any details about Gamestop).

The sense I get is that some people realized that many stocks had their prices artificially suppressed by the pure panic in the market at the time, and were likely to bounce back. Stocks crushed down to penny stock land could easily bounce back multiple hundreds of percent just by moving back up by $1, and if you had a good reason to think they'd survive, that's a pretty good deep value trade.

Some people seemed to jump on that bandwagon with the mistaken idea that you should basically just scan all stocks for things <$5 today that used to be >$20 or whatever and assume the 90+% drop will result in a bounce off the floor, even if it’s a “dead cat” bounce on the way to $0. DO NOT TRY TO TRADE THIS.

The theory is that a $100 stock that drops to $10 on its way to bankruptcy could bounce back to $15 first—a return of 50% if you time the floor and the bounce perfectly. In practice almost everyone who tries this loses all their money much sooner rather than later.

By the same token, people who “know” a company is heading to bankruptcy get their accounts wiped out when they short something on margin right as it hits a floor on the way down, get margin called on the bounce, and subsequently join the company in insolvency as they end up owing their broker more than they put in. Being right in the end is cold comfort at that point.

* **Could Gamestop just issue shares to bail out the short sellers?**

I guess it could, speaking entirely theoretically. That being said, consider the following:

They’ve already filed to issue $100mio worth of shares, or 500k shares using $200/share as a price assumption. I don’t know if they’ve begun to execute on that.

That was just to give them the runway required to take bankruptcy completely off the table.

As you note, at these prices, using stock to finance a turnaround is absolutely feasible.

There are, however, a few things to consider:

1. They have a fiduciary responsibility to their shareholders. They need to be able to justify how issuing even more shares is ultimately beneficial for the company and shareholders. “Because our stock price is high right now” is not typically a compelling reason, though maybe these circumstances are an exception to that rule given the extremity of the price.
2. While a healthy balance sheet would be an improvement, debt is usually cheaper than equity when it comes to financing a company’s activities. If they can secure solvency with the $100mio stock issue already authorized, and leverage the healthier balance sheet and insanely improved market cap to instead borrow what they need to restructure, especially in this ultra low interest rate environment, that would be better for the company and shareholders.
3. They can’t just make a snap judgment to do so. It takes time, board approvals, regulatory paperwork that is public, etc. There is a lot of work and potential risk in this process—particularly for this company.
4. Even if they did this, the incredible total volume of short interest being squeezed means that in practice it would be hard for the share issue to change the trajectory of the stock. The main effect might be to terrify some retail longs into bailing out of their position depending on how the news is presented to them.

* **\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ securities pricing theory/model means short interest has no impact on a security's price, short positions can be held infinitely so there really is no obligation to cover, so the thesis behind the short squeeze trade is invalid, etc. Mathematically long and short positions are the same thing.**

That may be true in some ideal theory assuming you are trading in some kind of mathematically ideal market using very specific assumptions, but you’re trading in a real market that includes things like counterparty risk, regulatory and contractual limits on ability to borrow (at least in theory--Hello SEC, threshold securities list??), interest cost, etc. that make trading in an real market different. I'll build on Box by saying all models are wrong, but some are useful--*within the bounds of certain assumptions.* The situation playing out now tells you that the short interest of GME is wildly outside the bounds of whatever models the hedge fund people are using to model position risk.

You can, in theory, infinitely roll your debt forward if you can continue to find willing lenders and are ok paying interest forever. Maybe this works out to be mathematically preferable to a squeeze to infinity.

But, step away from pure theory for a moment. We don't even have to look at empirical evidence in real markets. All we need to do is build a stochastic model of an equity market sophisticated enough to model margin limits and dynamic account balances tied to securities being traded as they are in real markets and you’ll see the probability of continuing to carry a short position converges to 0 over time. The only question is which happens first: you cover proactively, the underlying company goes bankrupt (and you cover for $0 less interest paid to borrow the stock), or you’re margin called and forced to cover with potentially unlimited downside. Take bankruptcy off the table as we have in the case of GME and you have one of two choices--get out or eventually get squeezed out. There is no such thing as infinite ability to roll borrowing forward in real markets, and if your risk models assume that I feel sorry for you.

* **Is this illegal? Will the SEC step in somehow?**

I am not a lawyer. I do not give legal advice. And, honestly, I have no idea. I can't think of any securities regulation that at least I may have violated, but I also don't have the ability to lobby the SEC on international news.

* **So what will happen next?**

I don't know, and most likely anyone who tells you they know is kidding themselves. All I see is a good fundamentals-based position I bought into at a reasonable but bullish valuation followed by the most bullish chart I've ever seen from a TA perspective. I have theories, but there are doubtless other people better qualified to opine on that.

All I can say is if you're in the trade, strap in and prepare for a wild ride. If you're watching from the sidelines get out the popcorn. The rate at which liquidity is disappearing means whatever is going to happen will happen soon (assuming the SEC doesn't step in with an extended pause in trading to bail out the hedge funds).

Thank you for reading, and good luck with your trades.

**\*Update from Original Draft, 1/28 Pre-Market\***

We're seeing tons of retail brokerages limit trading on GME to only allow selling, even when current positions and intended trades would be cash only?

Wow, I mean it kind of occurred to me in some sort of theoretical, abstract sense that somehow limiting large swathes of retail to sell-only was actually better than a general 2-way trading suspension, but who knew the short-side people could actually get retail brokers to do something so bonkers??  I guess you really do find a way to try basically anything when you're about to lose that much money.

Side note: obviously we don't have the mod bandwith for this sort of stuff, in every "meta" post I've made in the last year I've asked for mod volunteers and have gotten zero.  Reddit sent us an automated message yesterday because our traffic spiked so much (automated, because admins don't give a fuck).  I'm going to leave a comment with some additional thoughts on that below.

With regard to GME, we'll have a thread coming soon, /u/jn_ku's posts have been popular so far so his 3rd installment will be allowed shortly. - and that's the thread for today unless there's some MAJOR news item.  We're still gonna keep the posts filtered because nobody pays attention to megathreads anyway. 

**For this thread - please feel free to have meta discussion on the subreddit and traffic, offer up suggestions, call the mods assholes, etc.  Please do not discuss GME or anything related here - that goes in the follow up megathrad**

My thinking is 1)New CEO Martel (former head of Hydro Quebec) said in Dec. that the co. will be worth 7B USD after the Alstom train sale.  He's fired all the deadwood in the company and is attempting a turnaround.  2)They'll still have 4.5 B debt afterwards, the result of the A220 debacle.  3)They still have about 130 B planes on back order.  4)private planes only went down 10% during the pandemic.  5)Bombardier planes lines are all refreshed and they have the best private planes on the market.  6)Bill Gates/Blackrock just put in a bid for the world's largest private plane servicer 7)Buffet sold all airlines, but still held onto Net Jets.  8)only 10% of the rich who can afford private planes, use them.  9)Costco just put out a $17500 plan where anyone can ride private planes.  10)private planes usage is thought to be growing between 5-10% yearly.  11)And my craziest idea is that hydrogen replenished electric batteries will make private planes the first aircraft that can carry humans to be totally green.  electric planes will definitely start out on planes that can do short jumps and would be perfect in a world moving more towards remote working.  12)Elon Musk said tech for electric jets 3-4 years out.  And I believe he's always held zero emission jets as one of his long-term goals.  13) Bombardier jets are best in class and after their Alstom deal to offload their electric train division, will be the only solely private jets play out there.  all their jet lines are refreshed.  they have a history of attempting crazy, innovative things.  And they'd be a prime target for acquisition or strategic alliances in the future.  This is the idea I've been playing with in my head.  The stock is in penny stock territory, but a turnaround seems like very good bet and it seems pretty undervalued when even looking at their current financial situation.  And the future story looks inviting.  Any opinions?  Elon Musk should just buy the company and push private jets to become zero emissions ASAP.

I was reading about the dip today in the indexes. Apparently hedge funds across the world are selling many long positions to cover their short exposure (regardless of exposure to GME). This deleveraging has cause a broad decline as these funds/markets deleverage their holdings.

I’m not sure how long this secular trend will happen but thought I would post about it to get opinions. Does the dip continue? Is there more money somewhere that will come “buy the dip”? Or are we dealing with a prolonged period of depressed stock prices (no new all-time-highs on the horizon).

The article below summarizes this. Are you buying this dip? Or waiting to see where the bottom is? Any clue as to how much leverage needs to come out before the market stabilizes?

As an apple investor, i just find it hard to believe that the stock price will keep going up for something so big.

if a company is not only at the top of their respective industry, but the biggest in the world, how is there any logic that it will continue to rise?

at this point, is investing in apple (and companies like microsoft) just relying on a steady solid company with a steady stock price and dividends?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ GMO’s: a small DD ⬆️ (Agribusiness ETF’s) *Not a financial advisor. Have a very small position in this sector.*

Hello! Earlier today, someone asked in this sub, “are there any other good ETF’s to do besides ICLN?” I forgot what thread it was on, but seeing that kind of questioned confused me: as a ICLN holder, I also wanted to find my next “move” with ETF’s. 

I love the idea of investing not in an individual stock, but many at once. An issue with  ETF’s though, is that a lot don’t have anything to do with sectors some investors want to be involved in. Reddit investors and r/investing overall is on the “newer” side of this stuff, so the interest is all in energy, SPAC’s, etc. That’s why the only ETF’s most people know about here are ARKK, ICLN... these tickets we’ve heard over and over again with big returns. There also fields I believe in.
Then I came across this: 
https://etfdb.com/esg-investing/social-issues/gmo-involvement/

In today’s society, GMO’s are an oddly divisive issue. Despite the same scientific backing of concepts like Vaccines, GMO’s are actually very unpopular among a lot of people, and have birthed an “organic” movement. In reality, it’s pretty easy to understand that any fruit you eat has been modified in some way; bananas, for example, were barely edible until years of manipulation. Enough on my stance on GMO’s though;
 
Like clean energy, this field is a thing of the future, with recent growth’s rising a lot. They definitely aren’t as lucrative as an ARKK (yearly return on some of these has ‘only’ been 20-40%), but that simply isn’t someone realistic to chase. I think with the Democrats taking control of the government, and a president Biden tweeting daily about “siding with science”, investors might see a good opportunity to support GMO stocks. Organic food hasn’t had a good rap in the media either: the horn wearing man at the insurrection of the capitol refused to eat food that wasn’t organic. 

On that site, these are the two ETF’s that interest me:

**MOO**
VanEck Vectors Agribusiness is a large cap growth ETF that has one of the best tickers I’ve ever seen. Come on, MOO is hilarious. 
It’s also been a pretty fast growing stock that I’d say is a good long term investment. Unlike some clean energy ETF’s propped up by the rise of few companies (PLUG, TSLA, Etc), MOO is a very balanced ETF; its largest stock volume makes up 8% of its ETF portfolio. There isn’t gonna be one thing carrying or ruining this ETF. 

Also, a tip: options are weirdly cheap on this stock. It’s sitting around 80, yet I just put in an order for an 85c in February for almost nothing. I couldn’t believe my luck. 
**FTAG**
First trust INDXX global agriculture is a similar, but smaller ETF that has more room to grow, as it’s still selling under 30. Think of this as the ICLN of the agribusiness sector. Based on ETFDB, this has the most links to GMO’s of all argubusiness ETF’s, so if that’s what you’re interested in supporting, here’s your investment.

**TL;DR: GMO’s are a strangely controversial concept that are extremely important to the future of agriculture and food. Much like the hype around Beyond Meat. GMO stocks are large growth and have recently dipped a bit, giving a great in to buy up some stock. My only position is an option in MOO, and I plan to buy FTAG long term once I sell out of one of my current positions.**

I've seen some posts asking for value oriented investments so I wanted to pitch a value oriented stock thats in my portfolio that I think is flying under the radar. TSXV:MDP trades in Canada, (all financials listed are in $CAD) has a fully diluted current market cap of $175M and enterprise value of $232M. Most of the companys "debt" is in the form of a payable to the owners of two businesses they acquired over the last two years. Revenues have grown at a 129% CAGR over the past 3 fiscal years through both acquisition and organic growth. Using similar growth rates for the companys drug portfolio that they've exhibited over the past few recent quarters, ive projected revenues of $116M for FY21 (this compares to current wall street consensus of $112M). This implies that MDP is trading at 2x FY21 revenues, other pharma/healthcare competitors currently trade at 4-5x revenues which would indicate a potential value of $464M to $580M, which represents 100%-150% upside.

> Shares were down about 3% after hours.

> Here are the results, versus what analysts were expecting according to estimates compiled by Refinitiv:

> Earnings: 80 cents adj. vs $1.03 per share expected

> Revenue: $10.74 billion vs $10.4 billion expected

> The company also gave some production guidance going forward, writing “Over a multi-year horizon, we expect to achieve 50% average annual growth in vehicle deliveries.” Tesla expects faster delivery growth than that for 2021, with two new factories expected to come online this year and updated versions of its Model S and X vehicles about to begin production.

> Gross margins reached 19.2% for Tesla in the fourth quarter of 2020, the lowest since the last quarter of 2019. Capital expenditures hit $1.15 billion for the period ending December 31, 2020.

> The company also reported positive free cash flow for 2020 of $2.79 billion, more than double its 2019 figure of $1.08 billion.

> Tesla previously said it had delivered 499,550 vehicles in 2020, falling barely shy of its guidance for half a million vehicle deliveries in 2020. (Deliveries are the closest approximation of sales numbers disclosed by Tesla.) It produced 509,737 vehicles during the year.

> Both deliveries and production numbers set a new record for the maturing electric car company, seen as a triumph in a year when auto sales and factory operations were dampened by a global pandemic.

> Automotive revenue grew to $9.31 billion in Q4, while revenue from energy generation and storage reached $752 million, and services and other revenue grew to $678 million. “Other” revenue includes sales of Tesla merchandise including the company’s own tequila, apparel and more essential vehicle accessories like car charging adapters.

> Tesla spent $522 million on research and development and nearly a billion on SG&A, sales, general and administrative costs in the last quarter of 2020.

> Looking ahead, Tesla said it would begin producing its newest model -- the crossover SUV known as the Model Y -- at new plants in Austin, Texas, and Brandenburg, Germany, in 2021. Tesla intends to incorporate its own new “tabless” battery cells, which it unveiled at an annual shareholder meeting and battery presentation in September last year in those vehicles.

> Vehicle sales in China largely enabled Tesla to hit record deliveries in 2020. So did the introduction of a new crossover SUV, the Model Y, which Tesla began to produce in serious volumes in the first quarter last year out of its Fremont, California car plant.

> In the fourth quarter, after multiple price cuts, and a shift from selling more expensive Model S and X vehicles, to selling lower priced Model 3 and Y vehicles, including in China, Tesla’s average sales price dipped by about 11%.

> Since Tesla’s third quarter earnings call in October 2020, the price of the company’s stock has more than doubled, giving it a market capitalization of more than $835 billion and making it the fifth-most valuable company in the U.S.

If you make a post and think it's a quality contribution to the subreddit send a message to modmail and we can approve it.**

The last two days have seen something like 200 post removals to start with, so with WSB going private and it being 7pm already, which is when we're typically light on mods, I'm just going to step in and stop this nonsense for the time being.

Also, Reddit has been having server issues all day meaning automod is just fucking up all over the place and not doing it's job.  This also means modmail is on the fritz, so if you don't get a response in a timely manner I apologize but there's not a lot we can do about it - I couldn't even message other mods to warn em I was doing this.  Reddit is a shitshow rn and we can't spend our whole night fixing it unfortunately.  If people weren't spamming the sub with garbage all day we wouldn't be here. 

Lastly, as a PSA to all of the people who think they've been on WSB for a while and are confused: you haven't been on WSB for a while if this is confusing.  They regularly go private.  It's not the SEC, it's not the FBI, it's not whomever else they say is investigating them.  It's because the mods are tired of dealing with noobs that flood the sub after a media event so they just shut it down.  Hopefully that don't hit ya like a brick in the ol cranium...

In 2009, when QE kicked in they moved up for a couple years. Now it’s been sideways after an initial move. I think COMEX and the big banks play a part in it, since there is so much paper gold and silver. The paper market keeps the prices depressed while real physical trades at a premium?

What do you think?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ HOW TO GIVE SMART; or, how to not get swindled by "charities" r/investing mods, I come to share my experience donating. If the post is insufficient or too off topic, good on ya, do your job and I won't complain.

I see a LOT of people donating portions of their earnings  to charity and first off let me say, *GOOD FOR YOU*. You're doing something a lot of people in this world don't bother to, and seeing all of the posts of people paying off homes, cars, student loans, and so on melt my heart.

Before the GMREEEEEEEEs that have infiltrated every financial sub on the planet start shrieking about me insinuating you should cash out, *you make your own decisions on your own risk tolerance*. *You do what's best for you*.

Now, **when you do** **cash out of** ***any position,*** **give smart**. I've been in the nonprofit world for a while and can tell you there's a lot of "charities" out there that do fuck all with the money you give them or just let it sit in their account for the duration of the disaster that people were donating to alleviate (looking at you, Red Cross).

It makes me physically ill to think of your giving going to waste. I'm not going to tell you to give to the arts, or to medicine, or to space exploration. Just be sure to investigate where you're giving and don't trust the "Top 10 charities for X" posts you see all over the interwebs. I have provided for your sleuthing pleasure a few websites to vet your giving. They will allow you to search by name, type, etc. Give them a look and see.

[https://www.charitywatch.org](https://www.charitywatch.org/) \- Will tell you how the charity compensates their executives, their cost-to-raise ratio, and the program to overhead ratio.

[https://www.givewell.org](https://www.givewell.org/) \- Another organization that researches top charities to provide transparent data.

[https://www.charitynavigator.org/](https://www.charitynavigator.org/) \- Probably the most in-depth of the bunch on the ones that they review. They go into detail on the impact, results, accountability, and culture of whatever organization you look up.

Also, there's a boat load of foundations out there that would love to take your money and watch it grow. Many of them already have securities and other assets. *You can sometimes donate assets directly and the wealth keeps growing.* **You can also bequeath another account to an organization.** This means you don't touch it but name your charity as a beneficiary. Let it grow, then when you die, Tendie Claus will drop it in their chimney. For more information:

[https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/07/donatestock.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/07/donatestock.asp)

Other points to consider: Cost-to-raise is not always a good measure, so do your DD on charities. For charities that have most or all of their capital and assets donated, the cost-to-raise should be exorbitantly low. Don't confuse PACs with charities. Here's an example: PACs donate to pro-X legislation and legislators. Charities donate their services, products, and education falling under the X rubric to people in need.

If you're more interested in activism and advocacy, you can find some great resources here:

My apologies to the Europoors. Can't help you because I'm a lowly American't.

Bless all you magnificent bastards who have already done God's work in sharing the wealth you've accumulated on your own volition.

Tl;dr: Use these resources to research companies before you consider donating.

* GEX: 1,420,076,057

It seems there's a correlation between low DIX and GEX to market dips, and today was no exception.

I'm curious if anyone else here pays attention to these 2 indicators and what they make of it._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ My Watchlist For 1/28/2021 -- ThinkOrSwim Chart Import Links are Included \*\*I use the 180D/4H chart for most setups. I also use the RSI, Stochastic, Vortex, and 10-50-200EMA lines. but most importantly, price action is key.\*\*

**^(MY FAVORITE:  CAT, CNCE, DOCU, PRTA, PSNL, TXN)**

$ALLY - This is a beautiful channel up right now. It did break the 50EMA so maybe expect a 200EMA bounce, but it looks really good. All indicators show reversal soon.

$CAT  - Such a gorgeous channel up, right at the 200EMA line, support, and channel up. Perfect setup. All indicators look great.

$CNC  - Such a great channel at value right now. It gets lower sometimes but it also has extremely fast reversals, so let's position ourselves for that.

$DOCU - Gorgeous channel, right at support well. Such a beautiful play right here. Showed a bit of life before close; and all indicators look great.

$MDU  - Channel up that is right above channel support, but gapped down so I want to see a gap up. Indicators look great as well.

$OCFT - Needs a day or two, but right above our buy in area. Once it drops into it, it'll be a fantastic purchase.

$OKTA - Beautiful channel up, right at value and 200EMA line, it looks gorgeous. Indicators all look great too.

$PRTA - Hopefully a real gorgeous bounce right here. Right in channel, near 200EMA, at support - love it. Indicators all look beautiful.

$PSNL - One of my favorites, right into the 200EMA, channel support, and support together. Indicators also look really good.

  [https://tos.mx/t3ezw0q](https://tos.mx/t3ezw0q)

&#x200B;

$TXN  - Same setup as $PSNL, channel, 200EMA, and support area. Indicators look great, it is a good looking stock here.

  [https://tos.mx/VtUREdd](https://tos.mx/VtUREdd)_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ DHI , Residential Construction Company: Looking for input for research Looking into this company as a possible investment. But more generally, Id appreciate input into what factors I am forgetting about.

As I see it:

Pros: 

Lumber futures imply that the current price spike will relent later this year

Strong housing market

P/E relatively low, around 11

Recently beat quarterly earnings expectations, including increases in backlogged contracts

Cons:

A minimum wage increase could hurt the construction industry

Economic recovery is still uncertain
