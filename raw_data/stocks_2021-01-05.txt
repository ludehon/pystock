Given the recent growth in the areas of clean energy (with its storage needs) and electric vehicles, how do you see an investment in battery ETFs?

The most interesting one I could find was VOLT, launched by WisdomTree in February 2020 and giving solid returns after the dip in March (in particular, 66% over the last 6 months). Its top ten holdings:

Mineral Resources Ltd (3.92%)

TDK Corp (3.60%)

Umicore (3.58%)

Ganfeng Lithium Co Ltd (3.13%)

GEM Co Ltd (3.12%)

Contemporary Amperex Techn-A (3.03%)

Albemarle Corp (3.02%)

Nel Asa (2.92%)

Solaredge Technologies Inc (2.87%)

Caterpillar Inc (2.69%)

Most exposure is to China (25.35%), followed by the US (21.10%) and Japan (15.58%).

Also in a video made by **DONGXii****,** Li Bin CEO of Nio responded to one user saying that price could be 500 000 yuan = \~$77 000 USD which makes sense if the car is suppose to be competitive to the BMW 7 series as BMW 7 starts at $86 000 USD.

I think we all were expecting a mass produced sedan that is suppose to rival the Model 3 and to be similar in price too.

I was recently reading more about Market Makers and getting idea of how they work and why they are needed, but I still have a question that I haven't been able to find an answer on.  I am simply curious how often trades are executed with a MM on the other side?  


Is it 100%, 90%, 50%, etc? I know it is very hard to know exactly what it is but I am interested in at least a simply explanation as to what it might be.  I would assume that securities with higher volumes are less likely to "need" MMs. Meaning, if I trade NIO today which currently as 142 million in volume I assume I am more likely to be trading with another non-MM right? 

Now compare this to say to a very ITM option contract I want to sell. That contract could be thousands of dollars and so close to a delta of 1 that buying that as an "investor" seems useless. I have heard that you should never worry about liquidity because a MM will snatch that up because they can still squeeze out some value from it when it is exercised.  


Does anyone know of any resources/articles/blogs/videos/etc that explain MMs role in more depth like this?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Stocks vs LEAPS, best way to hold longer term but not forever? I have 60 shares of TTCF, I am bullish on them but I don't see myself holding them forever. Those 60 shares are costing me almost $1500. For the same amount I can get 2 contacts of 1/22/2022 $35 calls which in theory would net me more money. I guess the only downside is that I don't "own" the shares although I could always exercise the contract and I also "own" the contact. My goal is to compound my gains and grow my money to catch up on long term savings and if I do well enough use it to buy a house in the meantime.

Just want some other eyes on this before I go and sell my shares and later regret it._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ DGST subsidiary Imperium Motors to deliver Skywell's product line https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dsg-global-inc-subsidiary-imperium-133000551.html

News broke yesterday that Teledyne would be acquiring FLIR where shareholders would receive $28 in cash and 0.0718 shares of Teledyne for each share owned, equal to a total purchase price of $56 per FLIR share. I'm now trying to figure out what to do with the stock. If the FLIR stock goes over $56 before the transition occurs does that mean I should sell?

For reference, I would be paying Long Term Capital Gains (15%) if I sell.

Edit: I'm looking for feedback in a mathematical sense on if it makes sense to sell FLIR if it goes over $56 per share prior to the transition.  I don't know all the ins and outs in terms of tax implications, if Teledyne value goes up between now and then, etc... Is there a certain dollar amount per share (if not $56 or higher) that would make sense here to sell rather than hold? Are there other factors I'm not aware of?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Thoughts on AMC?

This test flight would of resulted in full FAA approval for commercial space flights.  Currently the company is working on fixing the issue snd doing a analysis of the spaceflight.  

They will fly again, we just don’t know when. I decided to talk to several engineers about the issue.  If you don’t believe what they said to me then go ask yourself as I am confident you will get similar responses.

Here is what they told me:  (consensus)

1.	⁠Computer connection is so broad it could be a lose wire to a software issue

2.	⁠Because the problem is easy to identify it’s likely easy to fix

3.	⁠Virgin Galactic will likely first want to identify and fix the root cause first

4.	⁠Virgin Galactic will next want to check everything else to make sure nothing else pops up for when they schedule next test flight

5.	⁠Whole process will likely take 1-4 weeks or anything in between.  (Because of Christmas holidays add extra 2 weeks).

So it appears they should fly again either this month or next month.  What is everyone’s thoughts here, is SPCE a buy?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Short Term Picks for Jan 2021? So I’m sure everyone has this same question, but in general what do we see gaining 10-20% between now and the end of Jan?

I get the risks and the fact that ant IPO is delayed 1-2 years + the fact that ant will probably have to scale down to meet govt regulation requirements but the fact that they're almost the same price from a year ago due to all the news while still having their core fundamentals in place could mean huge value in the next 1-2 years especially since once ant announces their new IPO date, that'll be it's own catalyst

Hello. I’m a long time gambler looking to refine my (lack of) skills. I’m a consistent stock market loser due to the uncanny ability I have of jumping in and out of trades for no apparent reason. I’m looking for a person who has been where I am and is now on the other side and has managed to stabilize what they do in the market. I’ve recently sold some real estate investments and will have about 100k to deploy, and I figured instead of flushing the life savings away I would see if I can find someone to pay in exchange for their help. 

If I’m going to lose my money, I want to at least do it in a strategic fashion. Drop me a comment or pm if you think you can help!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ MagLev Socks Does anyone know of any public companies working on Magnetic Levitation Train systems similar to what's going on in China and Japan?

Interested to know people’s thoughts as I’m contemplating exposing a small % of my portfolio to this stock_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Swing trading strategy development, and general questions. Small account. Quick background info feel free to skip:
I started trading early September and stopped about a week before the election because I thought that market was to volatile and I wasn’t interested in losing money. I was trading real money but only $200. I know  lots of people say I should have paper traded but I have consistent income and despite the risk I thought of it as if that $200 had bought me a new “toy”. I was in it for fun not necessarily profit. I ended up adding another $50 over the course of the weeks I traded. I mostly traded by obsessively watching the news and being a bandwagon. I made it up to $290, up $40. I also ended up losing all of my profit, I don’t remember why I should probably find out so I don’t do it again. Anyways after I lost all my profit I was down to 250 again and with the election near I took my money out.

A factor I entirely missed was technical analysis, I wasn’t interested to be frank and just wanted to play the news. Not only that but I didn’t even know exactly what kind of trading I was doing, day trading swing trading and so on. I had zero strategy.

I’m getting back into stocks (they’re fascinating and exciting) and a lot of the stuff that didn’t make since before has settled and now makes much more sense but I’m still kind of stuck with a few things.

I’d like to swing trade and here are some things I’ve picked up and would like corrected/ confirmed, as well as some follow up.

I have seen several swing trading strategy videos where an RSI below 30 is a must. Why is this and how important is this? When doing more research I see people analyzing charts and often times other criteria are met like MACD but the RSI may be at 40 or higher, which again raises the question how important is RSI?

What are the most important swing trading indicators in your opinion. From what I can gather it’s RSI, MACD,  and moving day averages. That being said I also see people who just make trend lines on consistent graphs (zig zags that are higher peaks higher lows) and these people pretty much just say buy in when the PPS meets the bottom trend line.

What are the most useful patterns in your opinion, I see cup and handle being mentioned, the zig zag, and big gap downs where you just wait for the stock to recover. I know there are many more than these but I’m trying to simplify this for myself which is why I only ask to have 3 very good ones provided.

Is risk management pretty much as simple as understanding the ratio of how much you can lose vs how much you can make, paired with stop loss orders? Anything more in depth on this is appreciated.

I think I understand the general difference between large cap and small cap companies but I don’t understand why you’d trade one over another. So far the only difference I see is that large cap appears more consistent, which I assume is easier to play?

What factors go into choosing your price range for stocks? The most consistent I see for swing trading is 15$-$50. Obviously that’s dependent on capital though. Given I’ll start with around $700 where should I aim? The main reason I ask is because the more expensive it is the less shares I own, the more the stock has to run for me to make profit. Whereas I could buy the cheap stock and since I own more shares I need less percent increase to make the same profit? 

Sorry if these are bad questions or have been asked before. I’ve tried YouTube but every video looks the same or they go over the same things. Three quarters of them don’t even give you a real strategy or real information, they just explain a mindset. I won’t lie I probably could have found this info somewhere but this is so much easier. That being said and resources for those questions are greatly appreciated._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Best way to alert for Check-Cap ($CHEK) FDA approval?

This question is to people who are familiar with Munger's famous 1996 talk "Practical thought about practical thought?" where he "reverse engineered" Coca Cola's success from 1996 back to 1884 ("How to turn $2 million into $2 trillion?").

In 1996, Coke was worth about $125B and Munger was estimating that it could eventually reach a target of almost 3 trillion servings and market cap of $2T by continuing to grow at 8% per year until 2034.

Needless to say, this did not happen and Coke's sales have not really grown in the last 10 years.

Some points:

- Health trends leading to reduced consumption of soft drinks in the west
- Internet, direct to consumer, moat weakened by reduced influence/dominance via traditional advertising channels

*****

> * Stock futures were largely flat, following the worst start to a year since 2016, which was also the last time the Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq posted January losses. Although the major averages did finish Monday trading well off their worst levels, the Dow and S&P 500 still posted their largest one-day declines since Oct. 28. The Dow dropped 1.3%, while the S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq both fell 1.5%. (CNBC)

*****

> * Wall Street’s attention will in large part be focused on today’s Georgia runoff elections that will determine control of the Senate. Both Democratic challengers, Jon Ossoff and Rev. Raphael Warnock, must beat GOP incumbents, Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, to capture the majority for their party. (CNBC)

*****

> * Senate runoffs in Georgia will shape what Biden can achieve in the White House (CNBC)

*****

> * The Institute for Supply Management is out with its December manufacturing index at 10 a.m. ET, which is expected to fall slightly to a 57 reading. Meanwhile, automakers release their fourth quarter sales figures for 2020 throughout the morning, with analysts surveyed by Edmunds expecting an overall 5.7% drop on U.S. sales compared to the same quarter in 2019.

*****

> * Shares of China Telecom (CHA), China Unicom (CHU) and China Mobile (CHL) were soaring in premarket trading after the New York Stock Exchange said it no longer plans to delist the three Chinese telecommunications giants. It’s a reversal of a decision announced a few days earlier, which had been made in compliance with an executive order signed by President Donald Trump. (CNBC)

*****

> * Carl Icahn, in remarks to CNBC’s Scott Wapner, warned that stocks could face a significant decline in the future and he indicated he was hedged accordingly. “In my day I’ve seen a lot of wild rallies with a lot of mispriced stocks, but there is one thing they all have in common. Eventually they hit a wall and go into a major painful correction. Nobody can predict when it will happen, but when that does happen, look out below,” the billionaire investor said. (CNBC)

*****

> * Wharton’s Jeremy Siegel: ‘Dow could easily tack on another 10% to 15%,’ but warns of a near-term setback (CNBC)

*****

> * British Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced another national lockdown for England on Monday, a strict public-health measure he said he hopes will help contain a new, more contagious strain of coronavirus. The U.K. has now reported more than 50,000 new coronavirus infections for seven days in a row, and Johnson said deaths are “up by 20% over the last week and will sadly rise further.” Johnson said he believes the country was entering its “last phase of the struggle” against Covid-19 due to the rollout of vaccines. (CNBC)

*****

> * Germany set to extend hard lockdown as daily deaths mount (Associated Press)

*****

> * New York has discovered its first case of the coronavirus variant initially found in the U.K., according to Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo. While the strain does not appear more deadly, experts have said it appears to spread more easily. It also has been detected in Colorado, California and Florida. Cuomo said he believes the new variant is “much more” prevalent than currently known. (CNBC)

*****

> * New York Gov. Cuomo to propose law making it a crime to skip the line for Covid vaccine (CNBC)

*****

> * Just 1% of Californians immunized amid slow vaccine rollout (Associated Press)

*****

> * The U.S. Food and Drug Administration pushed back on the suggestion to change the dosing or schedules of Covid-19 vaccines, saying the currently available data does not support such alterations. The FDA acknowledged the suggestions were made with the hopes of rolling out the vaccine more broadly to the public. However, with “adequate scientific evidence,” the regulatory agency said it believes changing the dosing amount or delaying the second shot by a few more weeks “may ultimately be counterproductive to public health.” (Reuters)

*****

> * UK is delaying second vaccine shots and it’s proving controversial. Here’s what we know so far (CNBC)

*****

> * Ahead of today’s crucial runoff election in Georgia, Republican Sens. Loeffler and Perdue were recipients of a late surge of donations from the real estate and financial industries. Their Democratic opponents, Warnock and Ossoff, had otherwise held advantages in fundraising during the races. (CNBC)

*****

> * At an outdoor rally in Georgia, Trump declared he intended to “fight like hell” to retain the presidency and appealed to GOP lawmakers to reverse his loss to President-elect Joe Biden when they meet Wednesday to confirm the Electoral College vote. Trump spent much of his speech complaining about his election loss, which he falsely and repeatedly claims he won. (AP)

*****

> * Supporters of Trump are planning to protest the expected Biden Electoral College vote certification with demonstrations Tuesday night and Wednesday in the nation’s capital. The National Guard has been mobilized to keep the peace in Washington. Trump has encouraged the protesters, tweeting Sunday he will be there. (NBC News)

*****

> * The joint venture to disrupt health care created by Amazon (AMZN), Berkshire Hathaway (BRK) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) is being disbanded after three years. Known has Haven, the organization was created with the goal of working to lower costs and improve outcomes in health care. The three companies are likely to collaborate informally in the future on health-care initiatives, but the formal end of Haven may be an indication of how challenging it is to dramatically improve American health care. (CNBC)

*****

> * The chief executive of Qualcomm (QCOM) is retiring later this year and will be replaced by the chipmaker’s president, Cristiano Amon. CEO Steve Mollenkopf, who is 52, took over the job in 2014. His departure comes as the company stands to benefit from the broader rollout of 5G networks. Shares of Qualcomm have gained 96.7% since he became CEO.

BILI | QS & Other Stock Market News [01-05] **Stocks take a plunge to start 2021, so is this the start of the next stock market crash? Why did QuantumScape take a plunge yesterday? Let’s talk about this and other stock market news**

**\~Very Long Post\~**

Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let’s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw the broad stock market having a red day ahead of important events like the Georgia [Election](https://ibb.co/VtxQdmk) of Today, while the US Congress is [scheduled](https://ibb.co/wzqV8PW) to certify the electoral results tomorrow, which will remove any remaining uncertainty due to the political environment as the next president will be inaugurated 2 weeks after that. Yesterday both the broad stock market [SP500](https://ibb.co/HByWLx9) and the tech heavy [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/k04mKGP) finished down almost 1.5% while the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/Cht7kGV) did slightly better finishing down 380 points, finishing down on the first trading day of the year for the first time since 2016, as all 3 of them did recovered somewhat after trading even lower intraday. We also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/rmHnjZj) rising more than 4 points or 18.5%, finishing the day near the 27 level which hasn’t been touched [since](https://ibb.co/mznW197) after the November elections.

We saw most of the companies losing ground [yesterday](https://ibb.co/h8sJKh7) with the number of stocks that were trading above the 50-day moving average finally going down below 60%, which in my opinion is a good & healthy correction & consolidation for the stock market, as the volume did pick up after the year-end slow markets.

Yesterday 10 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/j4MprMG) finished in the red with Real Estate, Utilities & Industrial losing more than 2.4% while the only small gaining sector was Energy. Meanwhile on a [FACTOR](https://ibb.co/Lzzvr0N) basis the market was more neutral, with most of the groups finishing pretty flat, but the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/v3Yk8PG) from yesterday reveals to us a bloodbath pretty much in the market as stocks were dropping left & right with only a couple of companies posting gains like Tesla, Zoom, Walmart alongside the semis & materials.

I think this slight pullback was expected by most analysts, as the greed and bullishness in the stock market was still very [high](https://ibb.co/PDHM90J) to end the year, as we ended the year with more than 46% of investors having a bullish sentiment, pretty near the 1-year high of 55% achieved after the election in November. 

We didn’t receive many important economic data yesterday, as the construction [spending](https://ibb.co/kXFvYvT) came in at a .9% increase in November, slightly lower than expected and the previous month, but in aggregate it was an increase of 3.8% year/year, while the Manufacturing PMI [index](https://ibb.co/Xkpj85W) came in at just over 57, better than expected and the previous reports, with production growth and new orders being the biggest catalysts.

While [TODAY](https://ibb.co/FDyT24L) we receive auto sales numbers, the Redbook chain store sales & the manufacturing index from the ISM.

Meanwhile, today we do start to see some of the most anticipated earnings [results](https://ibb.co/4KZBBBW) as this will pick up starting in the middle of January.

In some other stock market news, we saw QuantumScape plummeting more than 40% [yesterday](https://ibb.co/0GpXy3f) after they filled to sell more than 300M shares, as this will significantly affect the [shares](https://ibb.co/L0CGPkV) float and the dilution of the company. This is a very high risk with most of the high-flying stocks right now, as the companies are incentivized to issue shares to raise capital, regardless of the share dilution and the impact on shareholders. You can also see this with [Bilibili](https://ibb.co/tYspLZj) that just filled for a $2B offering in Hong Kong.

We also saw Taiwan Semi announced a record [CAPEX](https://ibb.co/HN2zPGF) spending for this year, as they [continue](https://ibb.co/m9s85DC) to invest in capital expenditure to improve process capacity and future products as they are expected to have the leading market [share](https://ibb.co/DLZ0jd6) in foundry business this year, which has seen a 24% increase year/year to over $84B.

Meanwhile, the New York Stock Exchange reversed its [decision](https://ibb.co/Ry4gfLM) on delisting Chinese telecom companies which finished the day down, but all of them have seen a huge spike after this reversal in after-hours, while most of the Chinese EVs and not only those, but pretty much the whole [industry](https://ibb.co/7QcRM9s), saw a big spike yesterday after strong sales to finished the year and strong reported demand from China. 

In the auto-industry we also saw Fiat Chrysler finally agree on a [merger](https://ibb.co/mv4Kp3x) with PSA. The merger will conclude with the company becoming the world’s fourth largest carmaker. They do unfortunately have a lot of things to figure out, as neither of the companies has much exposure in the biggest auto-market in the world, China.

So, let’s also take a look at what has usually happened in the stock market after a decline of at least 1% in the first trading day of the year. 

You can see this has happened 18 [times](https://ibb.co/CPkZzP8) with the Dow Jones, but this has led the index to finish down only 40% of the time in January and for the year, while for the SP500 this has happened just 12 [times](https://ibb.co/MPHN34j), but also only saw a decline for the month and for the year of about 42% of the time, with the last 2 of the 3 times that this has happened being at the end of the dot com bubble and in the 2008 big financial crisis.

So, I think yesterday was a good mix of political volatility combined with profit taking after a huge run in 2020, portfolio rebalancing and of course the treat of new [lockdowns](https://ibb.co/88pj0Yj) just like they started in the UK, which is a pretty perfect storm for the market to have a bad day. I don’t think there is any crash possibilities, but a correction or pullback is possible in the short-term before moving on higher as companies start to have easy comps, restrictions get eased and many more good things toward the end of the year.

So, let’s hope for a good day today instead in the market as the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/bmsPDqL) seem to be pointing to a red open, with the, while the rest of the world is pretty [mixed](https://ibb.co/xLfGFHT) with Japan, France and Germany down, while China & Hong Kong are up

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **"priced in"**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

Only negatives I can see if potential over valued short term with lots of developments will need to be completed for the companies to earn their valuation. But considering we need to build massive amounts of infrastructure needed to change to clean energy in the next 20+ years.

Oddly, while most companies announce guidance on earnings day, AYX tends to make unscheduled guidance announcements, having done so at least twice already.  Also, their CEO got replaced by Mark Anderson from Palo Alto Networks (whom I learned also was at Anaplan for hardly six months before being sacked).  Today, they hired a new Chief Revenue Officer (didn't even know that was a thing).

My investment thesis was that with COVID-19 about to come to an end (seemingly so anyway), companies will need analytics to better assess the post-COVID world and to identify ways forward.  AYX is rated by Gartner to be one of the better analytics tools.  I know that AYX has an unusual method of revenue recognition by recognizing revenue up front as opposed to over the life of the contract, which means that getting new contracts is crucial to AYX (though it might not be as much for some other company like say ADBE).  Apparently, today's guidance reflects that the analytics headwinds might last longer than expected.

[https://www.bbc.com/news/business-55540901](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-55540901)

&#x200B;

**The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) has scrapped its decision to delist three Chinese telecoms companies.**

President Donald Trump signed an executive order in November barring American investments in Chinese firms owned or controlled by the military.

The NYSE announced on 31 December that it would delist China Mobile, China Telecom and China Unicom as a result.

Now, it has U-turned its decision based on "further consultation" with regulatory authorities.

* [**Wall Street to kick out Chinese telecom giants**](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-55504881)
* [**US telcos to 'rip and replace' Huawei components**](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-55269879)
* [**China escalates tit-for-tat trade war with US**](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-55132425)

"I suspect that the NYSE never wanted to delist these stocks in the first place. They acted on guidance regarding the executive order," Jeffrey Halley, a senior market analyst from Oanda told the BBC.

"That interpretation has clearly changed and the NYSE has moved quickly to change course," he added.

The US exchange had planned to delist all three companies as early as this week.

Shares of all three companies surged on the Hong Kong stock market - where the companies are also listed - bouncing back after from punishing sessions in both New York and Hong Kong.

China Unicom rose by 8.5%, while China Telecom jumped 8% and China Mobile rebounded by 7% on the news.

The NYSE indicated that it might revisit the decision, saying it would continue to evaluate the applicability of Mr Trump's Executive Order to the three companies and their continued listing status.

## Dual listings

The three companies earn all of their revenue in China and have no significant presence in the US

Like many other large Chinese companies, they have a dual listing in the US and Hong Kong.

There are currently more than 200 Chinese companies listed on US stock markets with a total market capitalization of $2.2tn (£1.6tn).

In some cases, however, their share listings have became tangled in ongoing diplomatic and trade friction between the US and China.

Mr Trump has not only pushed for companies to be delisted, but has targeted a number of Chinese companies including TikTok, Huawei and Tencent on the grounds of national security.

China responded with its own blacklist of US companies as tensions between the economic giants escalate.

On Monday a spokeswoman for China's foreign ministry Hua Chunying had criticised the initial decision to delist the companies as "unwise" and reflective of how "random, arbitrary and uncertain" US rules can be.

Some analysts expect the end of the Trump administration might lead to a lull in the trade dispute, as the Chinese government waits to see what approach incoming President Joe Biden might take to US-Chinese relations.

"These are the acts of a dying administration and China will probably be content to await President Biden, and more clarity then over the general path of US China relations from the new administration," said Mr Halley._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ SNAP - lawsuit I tried to post a picture of the card I received from JND legal out of Seattle WA but it wouldn't post on other subs for some reason so, sorry, but I have to ask here, anyone have further information on this?

Doing research today and using the graham evaluation for many of my stock picks I found BP and Exxon were in my list and undervalued.

Jack Ma hasn’t made a public appearance in 2 months after pissing off Chinese gov’t Before this whole fiasco, I was high on BABA as were many of my peers. Jack Ma seems to have pissed off the Chinese government by publicly criticizing regulators and now he seems to have disappeared off the face of the earth.

The Chinese government doesn’t give a shit, they’re straight up mercenaries. They don’t even pretend to disguise their brutality. For Christ’s sake, they’re genociding an entire group of people (Uighurs, a Muslim minority in western China)!! Point is, if they want you gone, you’re gone. I’m not informed enough to cite specific examples, but haven’t they disappeared billionaires before??

My question is buy, sell, or hold?

Dear Interactive Brokers Prospective Investor,

IBKR aims to provide an exceptionally inexpensive and versatile platform for our clients to manage their finances.

It is vitally important to us that our clients be better equipped, pay lower prices, and have other advantages so as to generate higher returns than the customers of other brokers.

In part, we achieve these goals by getting frequent feedback and advice, and by otherwise working with our users. Owning our shares provides increased motivation for our clients to work with us toward these goals.

Investment by passive investors, and by others who do not use our platform, tends to cause a run up in our share price. This makes it more difficult for our clients to purchase our shares.

You may be considering investing in IBKR. **We would like to ask you not to buy our shares** unless you become an active user of our platform prior to doing so.

Sincerely yours,

Thomas Peterffy_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ My Watchlist 1/5/2020 \*\*I trade off of the 180D/4H chart. I use the RSI, Stochastic, Vortex, and 10-50-200 EMA Lines as well\*\*  

&#x200B;

$ABM: This has another dollar or so to drop into our value channel. It will also be at support near $36 which will be great. All indicators are low, so a reversal is coming.  

&#x200B;

$AMH: Low profit until breakout, but a sure fire way to make 3 - 5%. Also at support and ascending channel and 200EMA. All indicators are low showing reversal.  

&#x200B;

$CDXC: Support area on this channel, higher lows recently. Could see 4.40 if it drops more. RSI fair, Vortex low, and divergence shown on Stoch.  

&#x200B;

$CRK: Just broke downward trend, and showing real life, I really want to see higher high. All indicators are a little tired, may pull back for a buy in.  

&#x200B;

$DAO: Great channel value here. If it dies more $23.50 will be best value. All indicators are confused, it may be going either way. Wait for it to show its direction.  

&#x200B;

$DOC: Do your research and see why it died. Right into channel value, but we need some sign of life. All indicators say it cannot get much lower that this area.  

&#x200B;

$EPRT: Small channel above an obvious up channel. It may dies here, and if so just buy in there. But this channel is great for 5%. All indicators say it may do it again.  

&#x200B;

$ETSY: Previous channel resistance re-test. Also support are as well, All indicators say a reversal is likely.  

&#x200B;

$EXEL: Showing life as a small ascending triangle here, but just a great value for this stock. It may pull back to tap the 50EMA, then really take off.  

&#x200B;

$FR: Obvious triangle, has massive breakout potential. Right in our value area as well, and the indicators say it should reverse soon.  

&#x200B;

$GRBK: Great channel up, right at 200EMA, support, and channel value. Indicators look good, and Vortex has never been lower.   

&#x200B;

$KREF: Great ascending triangle, gorgeous. Oversold, Vortex low, Stoch showing an obvious divergence. Great setup right here.  

&#x200B;

$MLCO: Testing 200EMA line and strong support here. All indicators are low, and again super evident stop lose area so this is a low risk play.  

&#x200B;

$SURF: Beautiful ascension. Right above 200EMA, massive gains can be made. Stoch is low, I just love this stock._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Need any more proof that the market is just one huge bubble? Look no further:

Remind anyone else of the infamous shoe shiner story with Joe Kennedy?

As the story goes, one day in 1929, Joe Kennedy is getting his shoes shined. The boy began to give stock tips as he polished Kennedy's oxfords. In that moment, it struck Joe that he needed to leave the market. He reasoned, famously, if shoeshine boys have an opinion on stocks, the market is clearly, dangerously popular.

Personally I do not own either but am eyeing square heavily but I am not sure which would be the better buy between Square and PayPal

I know Square has CashApp which has been a huge success especially with Bitcoins recent run up. Also with businesses opening this year (hopefully) it could be another big boost for them. The downside would have to be their massive run up this year. How much room to grow do they have left? Especially with that run up they have to be very volatile.

PayPal on the other hand has been the bread and butter for online payments for years it seems. They’re well established and have good growth but at the same time how much more innovative can they be? 

This was not a DD or anything like that. It I was just looking for y’all’s thoughts and opinions. If you hold, how many shares and why did you chose them in general or over PayPal.

TLDR: which do you prefer and why?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ KTOS I bought KTOS today to add a defense company to my portfolio, and because I believe they're a smaller defense company with plenty of room to grow. 

Every time I look at their Yahoo Finance page there's a new article for a contract they were awarded. Earnings and revenue have gone up every year since 2016, institutional ownership is up to 92%, and they have an RSI of 61%.  Operating expenses have gone up while their earnings have also gone up, which leads me to believe the business is growing, successfully.  P/E is extremely high but I think that's because they're viewed by investors as a long term high growth stock, not overvalued. 

P/B and P/S is average to high average in the aerospace/defense sector but their PEG is sky high.  I THINK that's due to their super high PE which I again think is due to their high growth potential.

Point/counterpoint anyone? Stock analysis is a very new thing for me._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Market Recap - January 4 A Historic Sell Off!

Today the S&P500 plummeted 1.48%. The DOW Fell 382 points and the NASDAQ Crumbled 1.47%. Marking the worst day for stocks since October 28th! Today was the first day of trading of 2021, and with the move lower it marked a decline in the S&P500 on the first day of trading of a new year for the first time since 2016! The DOW was down as much as 2.4% marking the largest sell off on the index on the first day of trading of a new year since 1932!

The market opened higher but began selling off due to what I think was profit taking from 2020 gains in order to defer capital gains taxes to 2022. But the Selloff was ultimately accelerated due to concerns stemming from tomorrow’s Georgia Senate Run-offs.  Two senate seats from Georgia will be voted upon tomorrow and if these two seats flip democrat, it would lead to the Democrats being in control of the Senate. The reason why stocks rallied so much following the November elections was due to the fact that no particular party was in control and therefore the regulatory environment would stay as it has been, very bullish for stocks, for the next 2 years. If the democrats gain control of the senate, Wall street is fearful that tighter regulations could come to the country’s largest companies. Wall street is especially fearful of a tax increase that could effect the bottom lines of these companies.
