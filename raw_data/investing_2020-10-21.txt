MSFT as a part of your stocks MSFT is big part of the Technology industry. Microsoft's market cap is $1,686.5 billion. It makes up 5.95% of VOO the vanguard SandP 500 ETf and 10.78% of QQQ the Nasdaq 100 ETF. It has many products that make up a big part of the world such as Github, Azure,Dynamics 365,LinkedIn ,Microsoft 365, Microsoft Teams, Xbox and all of their stores that sell computers and laptops. Their Moat is being heavily diversified among many industries that will continue to grow and succeed in the future. Revenue in Q4 2020 was $38.0 billion and increased 13% from Q3 2020. Of that Revenue in Productivity and Business Processes was $11.8 billion and increased 6%. Some highlights in this industry was Office Commercial products and cloud services revenue increased 5% driven by Office 365 Commercial revenue growth of 19%,   Office Consumer products and cloud services revenue increased 6% and Office 365 Consumer subscribers increased to 42.7 million,  LinkedIn revenue increased 10% and  Dynamics products and cloud services revenue increased 13% driven by Dynamics 365 revenue growth of 38% .   Revenue in Intelligent Cloud was $13.4 billion and increased 17%, with the really cool part of Azure revenue growth of 47%. This shows that the cloud or Azure is growing massively as the Industry is still very new and growing rapidly very year. Revenue in More Personal Computing was $12.9 billion and increased 14% with an interesting point of  Xbox content and services revenue increased 65% . The 4th gen Xbox will be released in the later half of 2020 which should include many amounts of Revenue for Microsoft. Microsoft had a total revenue of  $143.0 billion and increased 14% YOY.

Now we shall look at some of the Financials of MSFT. MSFT has $136.527B cash on hand as of Q4 2020. That could buy Starbucks and still have 40 billion USD left over. They have a P/E ratio of 38.76 which can be considered rich but compared with other Tech companies such as AMZN with a P/E ratio of 128.17 and APPl with a P/E ratio of 36.83. This is in line with the coamnpies with a similar market cap.  The Debt to Equity is  0.50. which is very good for a company with MSFT stature. MSFT dividend is $2.04 with a dividend with a yield of 0.92% which is alright for a growth company. The Profit margin is 30.96% which is ridiculous for such a highly valued company. MSFT P/S ratio is 11.55 which alright considering their market cap. The P/B ratio is 13.70 which is high but considering other tech companies such as AAPL with a P/B of 27.5 and AMZN with P/B ratio of 21.86. They have debt but their total assets outweigh their liabilities. MSFT share holder  equity is $118.304B which is very good for them. 

Future Growth and my price target for Microsoft 

 Cloud computing service is a market which is somewhat new but is rapidly expanding. Microsoft Azure is about a third of MSFT revenue but it will grow faster and faster as the  cloud computing service market grows. It is currently worth about $371.4 Billion in 2020 and it is projected in 2025 to be  $832.1 Billion by 2025, at a CAGR of 17.5%.  Also MSFT will continue to supe up the next generation Xbox with new gaming studios and Xbox exclusives. MSFt is also trying to get into the 5G business and it has also created a strategic partnership with Starlink which will give many people faster internet which will MSFT in the long term. MSFT is very stable and increasing on markets that grow very quickly and that will add to its MOAT and it will continue to grow.

I have money in general market ETFs as well as 5-10 individual companies at any one time. I held through the volatility last year and earlier this year as I figured short term corrections were due and everything would recover. I have started selling off some of my positions in recent days though as the market seems to be at odds with reality. COVID is not improving (at least here in the US), and the election will likely create volatility (I think a correction either way it goes). Everything I have bought or held over the last year is up 30% or more and i just can't see this as sustainable without some pull back.

I'm usually 100% equities (95% US/5% International) but have started selling off at what i think are opportune moments and am now at 85% equities with 15% cash. The positions I sold were AAPL and INTC (both of which have gained more I believe they should have in recent months).

Tesla’s (NASDAQ:TSLA) third-quarter earnings for 2020 saw the electric car maker post $8.771 billion in revenue, beating Wall Street’s expectations. The results, which were discussed at length in an Update Letter, were released after the closing bell on Wednesday, October 21, 2020.

Tesla’s third-quarter was impressive, with the electric car maker producing a total of 145,036 vehicles comprised of 16,992 Model S and Model X and 128,044 Model 3 and Model Y. The company also delivered 139,300 vehicles comprised of 124,100 Model 3 and Model Y, as well as 15,200 Model S and Model X.

Tesla’s strong Q3 results were likely due to the Model Y ramp in the United States and the increasing Model 3 production at Gigafactory Shanghai. With these, expectations were high that Tesla would once more post a profit this third quarter.


The following are the key points in Tesla’s Q3 2020 Update Letter.

REVENUE
Tesla reported a revenue of $8.771 billion for the third quarter, beating Wall Street’s expectations. In comparison, Wall Street expected Tesla’s Q3 2020 revenue at $8.28 billion, as per FactSet consensus. 

EARNINGS
Tesla shareholders saw non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.76 in the third quarter. In comparison, Wall Street expected Tesla to report a gain of $0.57 per share.

I think high yield securities with high dividend yields are usually very very safe when it comes to price unless it’s Exxon(RIP). Most other securities have shown record highs in volitility due to the way the market has been. Also, I highly doubt I’ll beat the market, so investing in Clean energy/biomed/tech based ETFs is smarter than picking select companies and hoping you get the one that takes off. And then obviously add in some sort of total world etf/S&amp;P 500 for some balance. I see absolutely no value in bonds due to low interest rates and negative returns on a lot of foreign bonds so why not treat your securities as a sort of bond with quarterly payouts, and ETFS for the risk with reinvesting of the dividends. Just a strategy that I see as being very good in returns in the future._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ What sectors do you prefer to invest in? I feel like technology is overrepresented on reddit... which makes sense considering it’s done well the past few years and Reddit is a tech website. However tech isn’t the end all be all of the economy. What sectors do you invest in, and why? Which ones do you think will break out next like tech?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ What is the "real-world value" of stocks? It is my understanding that the price of a stock reflects how much people are willing to pay for it.
The price going up thus means that people are willing to pay more and more for the same amount of stock.
Most people will buy a stock in the hope of making money, which they make by reselling the stock at a higher price (excluding dividends from the discussion for now).
In other words, an investor will buy shares because they believe/hope that someone else will be willing to buy more for those shares in the future.

What I don't understand is how this can lead to a constant increasing of the stock's market price, and how/why such increasing price is related in any way to the actual company behind the stock.

I know that the stock value will go up and down in relation to how well the company is doing, *i.e.* how much money people predict the company is going to make etc., but I don't get why that is even the case. If I buy stocks of company X in order to make money off of it, why should I even care what the underlying company is doing? Of course, I will care because other people seem to care, but that only leads to the related question: why does anyone care at all?

For most other material goods, there is an underlying value. I can trade in gold with the sole purpose of making money, but at the end of the day that gold will have some inherent worth in that some people want to have it for reasons other than making money (*e.g..* because it's shiny or whatever). That plus finite reserves etc. justifies price fluctuations. What's that underlying value for stocks?

I've read about the "intrinsic value" of stocks, but that's something related to how much money the underlying company is making. If I invest in company X, why should I even care about how much money X is making, except for the purpose of predicting the stock's price? Unless, of course, X is sharing with me some of that money, e.g. in the form of dividends. But it is my understanding that many stocks don't give dividends, and so then I don't understand what's their "real-world value"._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ The future of Zoom is bright Disclosure: I have zero Zoom stocks or options.

Every week there is a post or two about Zoom. Most of it is superficial. Most of the comments ‘but competition from incumbents’. A lot of it is conjecture. 

I have always been intrigued with this company but could never understand the insane valuation so I never bought in, but Seth Godin’s recent Akimbo podcast episode on Zoom made it crystal clear to me why Zoom is so valuable.

I would strongly suggest anyone who is curious about the stock (long/short, or those who just want to understand the valuation) to go listen to that podcast episode.


Here’s a couple of the top points (podcast made about 20 great points, but these stick out to me):

• Imagine soon, computer generated live subtitles. That one colleague of yours, with the brilliant mind but horrible Chinese accent? They now have live subtitles, and everyone can understand them clearly.

• Know what else that means? Feel free to Zoom with other countries that speak other languages. Because the subtitles also translate what they say to English and vice versa. Business transactions will be streamlined. Transatlantic flights unnecessary. Misunderstandings reduced.

• Calls and meeting minutes can be transcribed automatically. This drastically improves various other business functions (legal, marketing, accounting).

• How about adding an internal corporate version of Alexa, or Google Voice (or Zoom simply buys one of the other dozen voice assistant start-ups). Yeah, live during the video call you can ask Alexa to do stuff: “Hey Alexa, can you double check those Q3 P&L numbers for us? Hey Google, can you check the feasibility of getting all that product into a single container, and how long it takes to ship that cargo?”

• Stats on speakers. “Hey Eric, you talked for 30% of the meeting, but every time you speak, 42% of the audience looks away from the screen and starts to play with their phones. Maybe you can try this to improve your presenting skills”. Or “Hey Eric, talk less”.

• Using these stats to ‘game-ify’ conference calls

• There will be more than one operator, it is not winner take all and the market is huge (Zoom, Google, Microsoft, etc). Even with competition, Zoom can be VERY successful.

• What about payments? There is an entire sub-industry already that Zoom hasn’t tapped into. From online classes and seminars, to OnlyFans, Cameo, etc, the possibilities of Zoom monetizing this and getting a piece of the action is endless.



These are some growth areas and roadmap. But quite frankly, at $148B market cap, Zoom still hasn’t gotten into the obvious growth areas (think Zoom hardware, unified meeting hardware that works with Teams/Google, displays, digital boards, etc). 

Will Zoom grow into a company worthy of its valuation? Maybe, maybe not. But so far, it’s been ahead of the competition, and so far Zoom is the one pushing the envelope. What company is most likely to add these new features first? Zoom, MS Teams, Google, Apple? The market seems to have decided.

Zoom is positioned to become the platform we do work on. The future of Zoom is bright, don’t dismiss it ‘because of competition’. That is lazy analysis. Apple is still waiting for competition from Blackberry, Tesla from GM, Netflix from Blockbuster and Disney….. keep an open mind when doing your DD.

When Twilio went public back in 2016, the company estimated that its product suite consisting of programmable messaging, voice, video and authentication products addressed portions of a $45 billion market.

Since then, Twilio has added a programable contact center solution, Flex, an email solution via the Sendgrid acquisition, and IoT products to its suite of offerings. The company estimates that with its current products, its TAM has expanded to $62 billion today and will increase to $87 billion by 2023 with the same set of products.

Twilio CFO Khozema Shipchandler stated that in addition to expansion in new product categories, the increase in TAM is being driven by new use cases from existing products, as well as the fact that in many industries, digital transformation is just getting started.

On the back of this growing TAM, management said that they expect to deliver 30%-plus organic annual revenue growth for at least the next four years. They further clarified this is not a CAGR number, but that growth would be over 30% in each year.

The Segment acquisition adds around $17 billion to Twilio's TAM, growing 30% annually. This takes Twilio's current addressable market opportunity to $79 billion.

Nokia is a stock that has been beaten down and out-of-favor for many years. This year it has popped down into the sub 5$ range (some would consider this to be penny stock range) several times and currently sits in this area. However, for Nokia, markets are slowly recognizing the potential, especially with the numerous upcoming contracts catalysts for the company. Let's take a look.

&#x200B;

**4G/LTE Connectivity for the Moon:**

Nokia was selected by NASA to set up 4G and to supply the other communications solutions for NASA’s space mission to the moon. This particular contract is only worth a meager $14.1 million, however it is just the start. This will be the first-ever cellular network on the moon. The win only reaffirms Nokia’s LTE/4G reliability.

&#x200B;

**Replacement for Huawei 5G in Europe & Other 5G contracts:**

Nokia has landed several contracts to replace China's Huawei as a 5G provider in Europe by 2028 due to security reasons. These contracts for mainly for the UK and Belgium at the moment. By 31 Dec this year the UK will ban their mobile providers from buying Huawei equipment. There are strong speculations that several other European nations will follow suit.

The US DoD [i](https://www.upi.com/Defense-News/2020/10/09/Defense-Dept-awards-600M-in-contracts-for-5G-testing-at-five-bases/2171602260363/)s awarding over $600 million in contracts to test their 5G communications technology at five of its military sites and to incorporate 5G technologies for warfighters.. Nokia is one of many companies involved in this.

In all Nokia has reached reached 100 5G deals and over 163 commercial 5G engagements worldwide. Now Nokia did lose out to Samsung when Verizon awarded it the contract to supply new 5G equipment to Verizon in the United States. This, according to some apparently spelled the "doom" for Nokia. However, this was before the NASA and a few other 5G contracts. Additionally, this Monday Verizon struck deals with Microsoft and Nokia to set up and improve private 5G networks.

&#x200B;

**Current price and some basic financials:**

Current Trading Price - 4.20$ (21 October)

REVENUE = 5.09B

NET INCOME = 94.00M

NET PROFIT MARGIN = 1.85%

OPERATING INCOME = 316.00M

CASH ON HAND = 7.09B

COST OF REVENUE = 3.08B

&#x200B;

**Risks/Takeaways and Final Thoughts:**

Nokia doesn't consistently beat analyst estimates, additionally, despite a nearly universal consensus that its shares are undervalued, Nokia doesn't seem to be able to sustain momentum. Nokia has been much higher than this in the past. When the company was a manufacturer of phones, the share price ran up above $30. Obviously, other mobile phone makers took control of the market.

The company is now reinventing itself as a 5G powerhouse, with all the recent contracts things are possibly looking up for the company. Value investors seek out beaten down and out-of-favor stocks that are looking to make a strong comeback, perhaps now Nokia fits into this category.

As always thankyou for reading. This is not all inclusive so please do your own research to supplement. Have a good day everyone!

Thankyou again for the contributions!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Currency Conundrums The different principles and definitions of currency (especially fiat) have always confused me. I don’t understand how anything can be seen as a non fiat currency. All currency seems to only be given value because of a government backing (aka forcing public trust) or natural public trust. History’s fix to this problem, gold, is an example of the latter. It’s just a piece of metal that the public has all agreed on to be worth something. The modern day’s fix to the problem, crypto, is legitimately just 0s and 1s on a computer. At least gold has, while very limited, some production uses. I understand, the appeal of these items and what makes them a “currency” is that their they have a limited supply etc. but the main feature of a currency and its main use, a storage of value, they are not. Their value fluctuates just like other financial instruments, and in certain situations (collapse of society, for instance) what are you going to do with blocks of metal or 0s and 1s on a computer? 

Another thing that I have been confused about recently regarding currency is the talk of “digital currency”. Does the US not already have a digital currency? We get a direct deposit into our bank account, use cards for most transactions if not all, Venmo our friends instead of giving cash, even the fed has admitted they don’t print the money any more they just “create” it digitally. I would understand the want and use for a blockchain currency, but most of what I see on the subject indicates that it’s not blockchain related (no way the fed would ever do blockchain either). So I guess my overall question is, what the fuck is a good with currency?

Nextera and other renewables, in my opinion, are looking at a long runway of growth for the next 5 years. Even ignoring the likely political environment in 2021, NEE currently has a backlog of renewable energy orders that exceeds the capacity of its current operations. Meaning, its renewable production will double if all new orders somehow stopped today. Its backlog of orders exceeds 15000MW.

Furthermore, if a democratic administration removes or reduces oil subsidies (as Biden plans to do), the price of renewables will further out compete energy produced by fossil fuels. This will coincide with an increase in battery storage availability (along with cheaper batteries) and legacy automakers bringing their electric vehicles to market\* (opening up demand on energy grids and indirectly providing energy storage).

I'd like to hear thoughts on this (very short) bullish argument and what companies focused on renewables other than NEE that other may be bullish on.

For example, if a prospectus made no mention of a contract with company X, and on day 10, after the IPO of company A, company A made a PR statement indicating that they had secured a valuable contract with company X would this violate the quiet period?

I read the comments in a few other posts about this, e.g. [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/bfug2c/what_actually_causes_stock_prices_to_change/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/afkre3/how_is_a_stocks_price_determined/), and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/60oaku/eli5what_determines_stock_price).
I think I understand the general idea: prices are determined by how much people are willing to pay for the stock. What you see changing in real-time is the price the stock was last bought at. There is an "order book" with all the bids people are willing to do for that stock, and as soon as a buy order matches a sell order's price, the transaction is made. 

However, there is still something I'm not clear about. First of all, that means that if everyone were to hypothetically buy and sell at market price, the stock price wouldn't move, right? So the price can only move when someone puts a sell order at a price that is higher or lower the current market price. But why does this work in the first place?

For the price to go down, someone must have put in a sell order at below-market price. Why would one want to do that? Why not just sell at market price thus increasing the profits? Unless nobody's willing to buy at current market price, of course. But with the number of people constantly trading in stocks, does this actually happen?

In the other direction, I understand why you'd want to put an offer at a higher price, but who would buy it? If the current stock price I see corresponds to the cheapest offer, does that mean that the price goes up only when there are zero offers at market price and the only offers are at above-market price?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Investing and inflection points People who've been investing for a decent amount of time - when did you feel your investment "ball" actually started rolling faster and with some decent momentum?

Keen to see if there's a point where other people felt like they could actually feel their investments working substantially for them. I found this article on the subject which seems to suggest after around 10 years or so, you reach that stage:

Like the title says... with the rising prices of gold, a weakening dollar, QE infinity, zero (and maybe negative interest rates), gold seems a good way to go. And gold mines seems like it could be a lucrative way, on top of physical, to be into gold. These junior mines are appealing to me... get in early, find em up under a buck a share and \*hopefully\* 10x. Obviously, do some DD, make sure they are expected to be profitable, and they're drilling in a good gold district... maybe have someone good behind the wheel of the company... but what else is there that I, or any other speculative investor (who are we kidding, just speculator's here) should know? Any and all info appreciated! Thanks!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Twilio - Where is this stock going? Anyone have any thoughts on Twilio and where you see the stock going in the next 5 years? They have absolutely crushed the markets so far this year but in my opinion, there's still a lot of upside left, especially considering that they also just announced an acquisition of Segment for 3.2 B, which will allow them to compete with the likes of Salesforce. However, one thing that concerns me a lot if all the competition that is entering this market and the fact that they don't have any significant moat around the business. 

Buy/Sell/Hold at $310?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Motley Fool's next gen supercycle & stock advisor services Call me a fool. But I spent my money on both services this year, after many years of contemplation. Despite all their clickbaity sales pitches all over the internet.

If you're like me - it'll probably take you years to give an advisor service your $. But FWIW, I wanted to share my experience on my leap of faith.

They weren't cheap. I started with stock advisor and with some promos paid $100 for the year. I bit my nails and cursed myself all the way through to the final submit button about how I was throwing my $ away, not expecting anything.

What can I say. I'm posting this 9 months later. I made a shit ton of $ on the recommendations. period. I could not have picked those symbols on my own. And what I like is that they're delivered by real humans too, not just an electronic feed.

I then went on to buy the next gen super cycle. Paid $1500 after promos! Still can't believe I did that. But it's essentially paid of by a small part of the gains I've already made with stock advisor. I got into this one because of 5G. If you've been spending your time looking at 5G, then you know that the time to get in is now. Their 5G portfolio IMO is quite eye opening and because I wanted to really add that to the growth part of my portfolio, I needed that research. There are some solid picks - some that were on my radar already but just getting the confirmation helps me mentally to pull the trigger. And then some were really companies that I would have never thought of looking up when thinking 5G.

Also, the fool services are not for traders or option players. If you're in either of those buckets, ignore this post completely. This is just for regular investors like me who like to stay invested and see their $ multiply and beat the S&P many times over. 

So there's my honest opinion. It's pricy but I couldn't have gotten the gains without it. Ignore their clickbaity ad styles because that's what's going to hold you back as a sane person. It's worth it._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Why I think ERIC and VZ are going to beat earnings tomorrow morning. I have mostly been following ERIC as per their 5G plans, but after doing some digging, I realize that Verizon has been quietly working on their 5G systems as well.  


Ericcson and Verizon have been working together for a while now,  In fact in Ericcson that brought 5G to Verizon. Ericcson is really the back bone of Verizon's network as par to these videos will show you.

Verizon/Nokia/Microsoft Deal: [https://news.microsoft.com/2020/10/19/verizon-teams-with-microsoft-to-offer-private-5g-mobile-edge-computing/](https://news.microsoft.com/2020/10/19/verizon-teams-with-microsoft-to-offer-private-5g-mobile-edge-computing/)  


 In addition to its network investments, Verizon has been spending in other areas. Last month, the company [agreed a $6.3 billion deal](https://www.barrons.com/articles/why-verizon-is-paying-6-3-billion-for-tracfone-51600099512?mod=inline_article) to purchase TracFone Wireless from [América Móvil](https://www.barrons.com/quote/AMOV) (AMOV). It’s a move to expand Verizon’s presence in the prepaid and value segments of the U.S. wireless market.   


Verizon has spent a lot money to make these deals happen over the year, and the deals are coming into fruition. Apple sales are up, the 5G towers are going online across the nation. So All in all, VZ should have a decent earnings   


 • Wall Street analysts expect Verizon’s third-quarter earnings to hold steady with their levels in recent years. The consensus forecast is for an adjusted $1.22 per share, compared with $1.25 in the year-ago period and equal to the third quarter of 2018. Third-quarter revenue is estimated at $31.6 billion, versus $32.9 billion last year and $32.6 billion a year earlier. Analysts also forecast $11.9 billion in adjusted Ebitda, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, which would be down from $12 billion and $12.2 billion in the third quarters of 2019 and 2018, respectively.

This company is a staple in the sports gaming.  They have a low PE thats under 20, high margins 34% over 10 years,  LOTS of cash, no bad debt.  There is a new wave of gaming that is about to come with new consoles.   I think they are the leaders to gain the most especially in the sports demographics.  They have all the licensing to stomp out the competition too.  I see this skyrocketing at some point.   Am I completely off?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ What to Expect from Tesla's Earnings tomorrow? Is it well poised for another Beat?  

* After record-breaking third-quarter deliveries, expectations for the electric-car maker’s financial performance during the period are high.
* Tesla’s vehicle deliveries surged 53% in its third-quarter to 139,300. What is impressive is that the deliveries soared 43% year over year when its factories were shut down due to Coronavirus.
* Tesla is expected to deliver over 1.2 million vehicles in 2022 and more than 1.8 million vehicles in 2023. After all, the battery day showed Tesla’s renewed focus to trim the cost to make the cars  
affordable.
* The consensus EPS estimate is $0.2 (25.00% Y/Y) and the consensus revenue estimate is $8.29 Billion (31.59% Y/Y).

She mentions several times, the importance of Tesla's Autonomy and/or ride hailing network as the key to it's next big driver in growth, which I agree 10000%.  If you thought Tesla is overvalued at it's current valuation, think again! This will have more parabolic moves to come if it's autonomy/robotaxi network comes to fruition!
