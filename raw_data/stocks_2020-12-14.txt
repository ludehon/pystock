 An Options question An options question for which I’ve not found a clear answer. 
Let’s say I buy a $1 Call for $100 of X company with expiry date of 1/20/2022 and strike price $50. Current market price is $30 per share. 

If I sell it on 12/18/2020, clearly OOM, then am I on the hook until 1/20/2022 or original seller who wrote that option? 

Additionally, 
Scenario 1: I do not currently own shares of this company. 
Scenario 2: I do own 1000 shares.

\-shorting MDXG, whose former CEO just was convicted of fraud

\-having to shutter his fund in 2008 when the rules on shorting were changed.

I'm tired of these opinionated articles posted on the internet influencing the market.   Let's face it, stocks will go up and down and we know the risks.  The only unknown variable is that one reporter with nothing else to write about that day, deciding he/she wants to share their negatice views on a particular company.  I know many will disagree, but the market is heavily media driven.   I truly believe these people should be restricted from stating their opinion and only post facts and current news.  Articles such as "forget about this company, check these out instead" or "time to sell and keep your profits" should be banned.   Sure, free speech, but on a highly trafficked website,  it becomes market manipulation. Even though most journalists  claim they have no personal interest in the stock, nor do they own shares, or won't purchase any for 72 hours after a negative opinionated article, they still make people lose money.  Granted, you'd lose money eventually if you make bad choices, but at least it would solely be of your own doing.  Losing a ton of money because someone wanted to get a quick paycheck by writing their opinion online is just wrong.  Like I said, many will disagree with me, but I truly believe with our modern world and easy access to the internet, this would be considered a form of market influence.

Let me know your thoughts.  Or if I'm full of crap. I'd love feedback either way._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ This is how a successful stop loss looks like! Just a quick scan of your decision-making process to set a stop loss.

If you are a beginner-intermediate trader looking to **set yourself up for success** right in this incredible community, **THIS READ IS FOR YOU!** *(let me give you a quick to-do list before opening your first trade!)*

If your broker's leverage system uses LOT SIZES, make sure to FIRST set your stop loss in the candlestick with price action *(or your reason to open the trade)* and **THEN,** use a trading calculator to know your lot size.  I recommend avoiding losing more than 2% at the stop-loss level you use. Usually, risk-reward ratios between **2:1-3:1** are the most **balanced**.  ***(for example; trading with a 5,000 capital, you could lose $75 at stop loss and earn $150 - 225 at take-profit)***

A quick realistic scenario would be the following. You know the price is hovering at the support line, and you want to open a long entry. However, you are not confident when to open the position and where to set the stop-loss. If you feel like this and open a position, you will not enter the market with the right foot.

The smarter trader will always be more patient. If the price is in the support line, he/she will wait for a candle confirmation to open a trade. For example, a bullish pin bar touching the 20ma in the 4H chart during an uptrend, or a bearish engulfing candle in ATH level, or a shooting star at the pullback retest of an H&S pattern, and million more scenarios.

What matters is that you backtest your trading strategies and have a list of 5-10 assets with low correlation to have multiple options to have 1-3 trades constantly open through the week. This could help you become a profitable trader if you are currently struggling with setting a stop loss at optimal levels.

I have some TSLA shares and account in a local brokerage company which partners with Saxo Bank and uses their platform for their global trading. Basically I don't have a direct Saxo Bank account but I trade by their rules and via their platform. And so, I can't user their support, which is why I am here...

&#x200B;

I have a plan to use the TSLA shares as collateral for CFD trading but I've just found that currently the value of my TSLA shares is not available in the "Initial margin available" field which tells you how much money you have to open a trade. **I contacted my local brokerage and they said that Saxo disabled the option for the TSLA stocks to be used as collateral due to the current high volatility caused around the pending S&P500 inclusion.**

&#x200B;

THE QUESTION(s): **Is it a common practice to disable the collateral option for a stock when such event occurs?** Do you know for some other examples and is it an expected thing from Saxo to do or it's more of an exception? I am strongly interested how much time I will not be able to use the function because of which I've just switched my old brokerage to this one which uses Saxo. I made some nice and safe strategy which I cannot apply and I'm quite sad (and already missing a profit).

Vehicle seats four and can run for 16 hours before recharging. CEO says Zoox may eventually build package delivery vehicles https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-14/amazon-s-zoox-unveils-robotaxi-for-future-ride-hailing-service

Zoox Inc., the self-driving startup owned by Amazon.com Inc., unveiled a fully autonomous electric vehicle with no steering wheel that can drive day and night on a single charge.

The vehicle, which Zoox describes as a driverless carriage or robotaxi, can carry as many as four passengers. With a motor at each end, it travels in either direction and maxes out at 75 miles per hour. Two battery packs, one under each row of seats, generate enough juice for 16 hours of run time before recharging, the company said. To commercialize the technology, Zoox plans to launch an app-based ride-hailing service in cities like San Francisco and Las Vegas.

“This is really about re-imagining transportation,” Zoox Chief Executive Officer Aicha Evans said in an interview with Bloomberg Television. “Not only do we have the capital required, we have the long-term vision.”

The company also plans to launch ride-hailing services in other countries, Evans said. Executives didn’t say how much rides would cost but that they would be “affordable” and competitive with services operated by Uber Technologies Inc. and Lyft Inc. Nor did they say when the service would launch but confirmed it wouldn’t happen in 2021. In a video released Monday, Evans used Zoox’s app to hail the vehicle outside San Francisco’s Fairmont hotel and took a spin around the block.

Acquired by Amazon in June for an undisclosed sum, Zoox is one of several companies racing to put fully autonomous vehicles on the road, an effort that’s taking longer than anticipated. Most are testing retrofitted conventional cars on public roads, and few are commercially deployed. In October, Alphabet Inc.’s self-driving unit Waymo started a fully driverless taxi service in suburban Phoenix. General Motors Co.-backed Cruise LLC is also testing autonomous cars -- recently without safety drivers -- in San Francisco, using a fleet of electric vehicles based on the Chevy Bolt.

Despite being years from deployment, several of Zoox’s quirky-looking mint-green vehicles are already being built at a facility in Fremont, California. The factory has the capacity to eventually produce 10,000 to 15,000 units annually, executives said. Suppliers send the major components -- the drive unit, body, battery pack and so on -- pre-assembled, and Zoox then does final assembly in stages, a process it likens to building a Lego set. Executives declined to reveal the battery supplier.

The unveiling of a production car marks a significant step for a company that has been working on an autonomous passenger vehicle since its founding in 2014. At times Zoox was “ridiculed” for what it was trying to do, Chief Technology Officer Jesse Levinson told Bloomberg TV.

“Unlike many of the concept cars other companies have shown in the last several years this vehicle has passed all the FMVSS crash tests,” Levinson said, referring to tests required by U.S. regulators. Zoox isn’t the first to unveil a fully autonomous passenger vehicle. GM’s Cruise showed off a battery-powered shuttle in January. Called the Origin, it also does away with many of the controls present in conventional cars: pedals, rearview mirrors, steering wheel. Cruise plans to commercialize the Origin through a ride-sharing service and says it’s cheaper to run than a conventional car.

Zoox’s vehicle is similar but smaller. On each corner a “sensor pod” houses a spinning laser sensor and other lidars and as well as cameras to help it navigate. A pair of front-facing cameras sit atop of the vehicle, with other less-visible sensors mounted on the sides. Each corner pod has a 270-degree field of vision, enabling the car to see more than 360 degrees of terrain at once.

The vehicle’s safety features include airbags that form a cocoon around each passenger in the event of a crash, which Zoox says is unlikely given its confidence in the technology. The company can manually operate the vehicles remotely and communicate with passengers in real time. For those worried about privacy, Zoox says passengers will have the option to blur images captured by the on-board camera.

When Amazon acquired Zoox, industry watchers speculated that the e-commerce giant eventually planned to deploy fleets of driverless delivery vehicles. In the interview, Evans said there are currently no plans to do so but acknowledged that “at some point we could move packages.”_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Brookfield Renewable Partners stock split Good afternoon dear r/stocks followers,

Has Brookfield Renewable Partners gone through with their planned stock split this morning? The company said the split would be a 2 for 3, and that the price would drop proportionally (so by 33% per share). According to my CIBC wealth account, the price opened at 2/3 the price that it closed on Friday. It doesn’t show that the share prices ever reached their price that was around $70USD. Furthermore, CIBC wealth, google, and other trading apps’ graphs show that the shares gained value. Maybe i’m just trash at interpreting news, but I haven’t found any relevant news today on how the price dropped. If the split did happened, I got no additional shares (was at 10 on Friday and is still at 10). It would be really appreciated if someone could clear it up. Thank you for your time and have a wonderful day.

Sincerely,

But now, Roblox will postpone its IPO into 2021.

Analysts had forecast that if Roblox went public this year, its value could easily reach $8 billion -- twice what investors value the company at in a recent round of private fund-raising. But as The Wall Street Journal reported Friday, the explosive IPO action last week surrounding Airbnb (NASDAQ: ABNB) and DoorDash (NYSE: DASH) have given Roblox second thoughts.

“Reflect Scientific is now working with organizations such as the governments’ Operation Warp Speed and air carriers that have the expertise to utilize this storage system for specific customized applications,” commented Kim Boyce, CEO of Reflect Scientific. 

RSCF was on fire last week but it's just getting started. Compare them to TZPC that already had their run from 0.05 all the way up to $30 a share and settling in around $22.

This Week Stock Earnings Reports [12-14] **Are stocks going to benefit from the Santa Claus effect this year? What’s the latest news in the stock market? This week earnings reports & more**

**\~Very Long Post\~**

Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let’s start with the recap of Friday, as we saw the [DOW](https://ibb.co/XF2RH8q) finish in the green up .16% but closed the week down 0.57%, while both the [SP500](https://ibb.co/CBm2qZQ) which lost .13% on Friday and .96% for the week and the [NADSAQ COMPOSITE](https://ibb.co/RbY68rn) also down .23% on Friday and 0.69% for the week struggled to recover after a very bad start to the trading day. We also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/C68dbNJ) finishing the week at a new high, over the 23 levels, as the volatility index has seen a spike of over 12% in the last [week](https://ibb.co/0F78Vtm).

You can see that a big majority of the companies were on the decline on [Friday](https://ibb.co/NCBm6Bg), with low volumes, as only around 10B shares traded hands compared to 11.5B shares in the last 20 trading days, as some profit-taking combined with some healthy corrections in stocks have moved the markets slightly lower.

On a factor [basis](https://ibb.co/k1HTXfs), value plays suffered on Friday, especially small and mid-caps, while growth was pretty flat, with only Energy and Financials lost more than 1% on Friday, as Energy was the only [sector](https://ibb.co/ynW3BzJ) to finish in the green this week, up 1,21%, while Real Estate lost almost 3% and Financials also lost almost 2% in the past week.

Here is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/cNCSPHk) from Friday, not a lot of green to be seen, with the exception of Microsoft, Disney and Toyota.

While for the week, pretty much the same can be seen in the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/rfcfdL6), as Disney, AT&T, Elly Lilly and Toyota were the only big gainers.

[Here](https://ibb.co/fXLgKLc) is the most interesting economic data coming out this week with Wednesday and Thursday being the biggest ones, as we get a better read on what the economy is doing, while also getting the Federal Reserve latest and last decisions for this year.

[Today](https://ibb.co/M9GFCFf) we get the electoral college across state capitols formally casting their votes, while On Thursday we also get the Moderna vaccine FDA Ad Com voting process and results.

The Fed doesn’t really have many [options](https://ibb.co/p44t6C0) at the moment, but they can still move to buy longer-term bonds or decide to buy even more than the current monthly allocated program. The Fed is not expected to cut the benchmark rates anymore, as they are already near 0.

So, I think we might start to see some of the Santa Claus [effect](https://ibb.co/1KF6gJC) starting very soon, probably sometime between this week and the middle of next week, as you can see in this chart, the SP500 has posted very good returns in the past 70years on average in this period, but yeah, who knows after what has happened this year.

Also, you can see in this [chart](https://ibb.co/2YMgNSK), that the big tech stocks have underperformed the market since the start of September, as small caps have outperformed, I think we might finally see some of the big tech names start to gain some momentum once again, especially Apple & Amazon.

I think this might happen as more of the big cash flows that are sitting on the [sidelines](https://ibb.co/8dpv9gd), might finally start to be move to the stock market.

While on Friday we saw the consumer [sentiment](https://ibb.co/Vpc4Hfs) jumping more than expected, but is still way [down](https://ibb.co/5FTD721) from a year ago. We also got the producer price [index](https://ibb.co/jDTTkgb) for November which rose by .1% and is up .8% year over year, more than expected.

[Here](https://ibb.co/hLkWLYz) are the most interesting earnings report for next week, I am especially interested to see what Jabil, FedEx, Nike (Friday) and Blackberry report.

I think we can see great number from Jabil which will benefit from the iPhone 12 sales, while FedEx, the largest parcel delivery service in the world is on watch, as they are considered a proxy for the global economy. With Nike also expected to report strong numbers with an increasing number of physical stores re-opening and a strong boom in direct-to-consumer business.

Guys, [Disney](https://ibb.co/xfB6Qxz) saw a huge pop in the stock after a great investor day, but i won't go into more details as i have previously posted about them.

I also wanted to mention this, but I guess you already know this by now, the [FDA](https://ibb.co/8rPL1q2) gave the green light very late on Friday while the [CDC](https://ibb.co/kMkxfFf) also formally signed off in the weekend.

The first deliveries of vaccines are expected to reach more than 150 state locations [today](https://ibb.co/D9XjNyR) with another 450 locations in the next couple of days as the vaccine began to be packaged and shipped on [Sunday](https://ibb.co/84mzTwG) morning. So yeah, I guess we can keep the tradition of Vaccine Monday going. If both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines will be available, with the US just exercising the [option](https://ibb.co/QkCFhW6) to buy another 100M doses from Moderna, the US is aiming to vaccinate 20M this month, 30M in January and another 50M in February, that would bring the total to over 100M people.

[Walmart](https://ibb.co/n6wJKvx) has started to mobilize to help with the distribution, while [CVS](https://ibb.co/qkWYTJx) also has plans to begin vaccinations starting next Monday.

Guys, just wanted to mention that I came across this [tweet](https://ibb.co/K5fsgxN), I think it pretty much sums up the latest IPO frenzy that we had with [Doordash](https://ibb.co/Rzq7g9F) and AirBnB, with both in my opinion starting trading at insane valuations, that aren’t really justifiable.

The big IPOs this week, had a big influence on the markets, as investors probably had to sell a lot of stuff to buy into DASH & AirBNB, this might have led to an imbalance in the markets. As people who used market orders were forced to sell stuff to fund the buying of these 2 highly overvalued stocks in my opinion.

Just look at this [chart](https://ibb.co/9VpnfS7), as the average first-day return for IPOs has seen a huge spike in the last year, with an average of 37% first day return this year. But, just look at the % of [IPOs](https://ibb.co/V339X8N) with negative earnings also increasing since 2010, that just doesn’t seem to bother investors, as they are looking for fast growing companies that don’t emphasize earnings.

Just a fact, [AirBNB](https://ibb.co/S3QFQ64) became only the 3rd tech company to open with a market cap over $100B, the only others ones being Alibaba and Facebook.

After this 2 crazy IPOs some of the next [companies](https://ibb.co/J5BRZ8f) that planned to start trading last week, Affirm and Roblox, delayed the plans, as this companies seek to determine the right price for the shares and the right company valuation with advisors, so they don’t leave money on the table like AirBnB and Doordash have done last week.

My opinion is that if you don’t like these high-flying IPOs, don’t short them, just avoid them and buy stocks that you really like and expect to have great growth

We also saw a [report](https://ibb.co/86vpGyP) from The Information, which is not actually doing any reporting of any specific deals, that presented their next logical M&A deals, this led to the [stock](https://ibb.co/D1VGXwj) of Dropbox to spike almost 14% including after-hours trading and [MongoDB](https://ibb.co/mHPQw0L) to gain more than 6% on Friday.

Other [news](https://ibb.co/5GJBH1w) came for videogames and video gaming consoles which saw a record $7B in sales, over 35% more than last year, bringing the total to over $44B for the year, with more than $1.4B spent on news consoles from Sony and Microsoft just in November.

While in the EU, [Brexit](https://ibb.co/YPQRhqv) talks keep getting extended time and time again as the EU and Great Britain still are trying to figure out some sort of a deal.

We also found out what companies are getting [kicked](https://ibb.co/4Y74VFQ) out of the SP due to the inclusion of Tesla and that the latest [shutdowns](https://ibb.co/C5116dp) for the holidays have been extended more than usual.

Let’s hope for a great day in the market as the [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/Zzf0FVN) seem to be pointing at a good open, hopefully some green action continues after that.

So I have bought plenty of shares of Canadian stocks, some OTCs also, through Fidelity and never got hit with a fee.  Last week I bought some FTRPF and got hit with a $50 commission fee, the first time.  I have bought shares in EMX for example, Canadian company, and was not charged any commissions.  I posted on the Fidelity sub and someone said it is the "Foreign Settlement Fee."  Does anyone have better insight into how this fee works and when it is applied?

Part of why I wonder is because I am in Thailand right now, so I can't really call the Fidelity representatives as easily in order to inquiry to them directly about the fees.  I am weary about buying more shares in Canadian OTCs now due to this fee I got hit with last week.

Sorry for stupid question might be obvious to you experienced folks_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Why I Think Recovery Stocks Are a Ticking Time Bomb For EXPLOSIVE Growth (AAL, CCL, PLAY, etc.) As we all know, many industries have been hit especially hard due to the COVID-19 pandemic. These industries include airlines, cruiselines, restaurants, movie theaters, and even Dave & Busters.

People LOVED traveling prior to the pandemic. They loved going on cruises. They loved eating out, watching a movie at the cinema, and taking their kids out to play at $PLAY while they sit back and enjoy a beer.

These feelings haven't changed. People are ITCHING to do these things again. **It's like telling your dog to 'sit' before they can have their favorite treat.**

In this case, the coronavirus is the pet owner and we are the dogs. These restricted activities are our 'favorite treat.' COVID is telling us to "sit".... "stay...." and sooner or later, it's gonna yell "GOOD BOYYYYYY!!!!!!!" and the dog will FLOCK to the treat.

But, the only difference is, this time the pet owner told the dog to sit for 9-10 months. And he's going to continue to tell us to sit for another 3-4 months.

But?

What happens when we finally get the green light?

WE RUN FASTER THAN USAIN BOLT AND SWARM TO THE GOODIES!!!!

This, ladies and gentlemen, is what is called pent-up demand. And this is the reason why I think recovery stocks will not only reach their all-time highs in 2021, but make NEW all-time highs as well.

I already know what some of you are about to say: ***But what about the risk of bankruptcy? :(***

The risk of bankruptcy with most of these stocks is shrinking every day. Vaccines are on the way. Everyone in America who wants a vaccine will be able to get one by Spring-Summer 2021. That's literally just a few months away.

Not only that, but a bill *should* be passed sometime this week. stimulus is coming. Bailouts are coming. The warmer season is coming. Literally, almost everything is looking good for recovery stocks at the moment.

**TL;DR: I think recovery stocks will not only reach their ATH's in 2021, but break new highs as well.**

Ready to spike!! It dipped after last earnings report was lower than expected. Still it held at 15-16 $/share.  Volume looks great here. Pay attention to the yellow lines. Thats investors coming in and staying. It's going up to 17$ either this week or next. It's a discounted stock at the moment. Wait to see what it does market open. Could dip farther. But the tightness of the candles show that the investors picked bottom value for the shares. Look at wednesdays tightness before the jump thursday.

Might go red for a day or two before it jumps back. Watch for the trend setting back up to reach 12$. 10% Increase EOW isn't unlikely here. These stocks are at a discount right now. Could go lower. Buy around 11$ depending on the first 3 hours monday. You should be able to decide if its green or red by then. If the swings are crazy though don't buy just yet.

2. 26/11/2020: Interim decision from the Therapeutic Goods Administration (“TGA”) to down-schedule CBD products from Schedule 4 to Schedule 3 medicine. The interim decision would permit medicines containing at least 98% CBD and which are entered on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods (ARTG) to be provided by pharmacists to adults aged 18 years and over without the need for a prescription. Final decision expected in the coming weeks.

Cannabis will now be classified under Schedule I, which is the least restrictive drug classification
4. 04/12/2020: The US House of Representatives has passed the Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement (“MORE”) Act to remove cannabis for the US Controlled Substances Act.

I think the data I am collecting will be interesting to many of the members here. 

I have been analyzing comments and posts on reddit to determine what stocks are mentioned the most. This week I am looking at the options contracts that have been mentioned on the subreddits we track.  Specifically, I am looking at contracts expiring this Friday 12/18.    The data collected for this analysis was collected from 12/04 – 12/10.  For Friday’s expiration there are 448 contracts and 714 mentions of these contracts.  Quite an increase from last week which is pretty exciting.  Though, I mostly attribute this to improvements in the machine learning models we are using to identify stocks and contracts.  The most popular contracts this week are the PLTR 30 Call and the LAZR 30 Put.  

The goal here is to track what reddit is following and to see how reddit preforms.  There is this notion that retail investors often fail to beat the market. This is why financial advisors recommend that you buy into the major ETF’s such as SPY.  As historically there have been few people that manage to beat the major Index’s year over year.  My hypothesis going into this week is that I should bet against the trends on reddit as typically the retail investor is wrong.  

As of week 1, I would have profited $1710 betting against reddit [Last Weeks Recap](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditTickers/comments/kbcc6x/weekly_results_what_if_you_sold_the_most_popular/).  I will continue to track my progress each week. 

I just want to emphasize it does not matter if I am right or wrong.  More importantly this research is to identify if there are any trends worth following. 

Call Data

* Out of the 448 contracts 356 are calls (80% Long)  
* 70.8% of the calls are out of the money
* The out of the money Calls are an average of 23% out of the money. 
* The in the money calls are an average of 26% in the money. 

Put Data

* Out of 448 Contracts 92 are puts
* 67.4% of the puts are out of the money
* The out of the money puts are an average of 18.7% out of the money
* The in the money puts are an average of 22% in the money 

On both the call and put sides the out of the money contracts are an average of 20%+ out of the money.  I am not that surprised as there is a lot of yolo culture on reddit.  It is surprising to see the number of contracts that are out of the money in general.  Out of the 448 contracts only 134 are in the money as of last Friday’s close. 

The most popular calls that are in the money are: 

* PLTR 20, 22, 26 
* TSLA 600 
 

The most popular puts that are in the money are: 

* LAZR 30
* CRSR 35.  

The most popular calls that are out of the money are 

* PLTR 30, 32, 35 
* TSLA 630, 650, 700
* ARKG 100
* NIO 50 
* SPY 380

The most popular puts that are out of the money are:

* LAZR 25, 20
* SPY 350
* PLTR 25, 26
* SNOW 330

My hypothesis is that the majority of these contracts will be losers.  Based on the data I would be looking to sell the PLTR 32 and TSLA 630 calls and LAZR 20 / 25 Puts. I will update with the premium prices first thing tomorrow morning at market open.

Premium As of 11:A.M. Monday Morning:

* TSLA 630 $3710
* PLTR $40

* LAZR 25 $130
* LAZR 20 $ 20_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ RSCF - poised for success I recently stumbled upon this company. They just obtained a patent for Covid-19 Capable Air Transportation System that uses liquid nitrogen. See article below.

Now that the the Pfizer vaccine has been approved it does seem to be getting some traction at the end of last week. That is where I hopped on the train (125 shares) and why I found this article below giving me further belief I may have found a diamond in the rough. 

 [Reflect Scientific (RSCF) becomes December’s actively trading stock due to optimized cooling container for vaccines – Own Snap](https://ownsnap.com/reflect-scientific-rscf-becomes-decembers-actively-trading-stock-due-to-optimized-cooling-container-for-vaccines/) 

Now, the question I have is if this is just another stock that speculation is going to make a bubble with or does anyone see this company actually having the product that will be supplying the vaccine and set itself up as the staple for keeping transportation?  I'm not great with fundamentals and would love any other opinion on this company._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ The only reason I am staying away from ARKK and ARKQ is because of Tesla. is this irrational? I like the ark funds and i’d like to add them to my portfolio, but i really do not want to touch tesla. is this a bad reason for not wanting to invest in arkk and arkq? i’ve been considering arkf and arkg instead, but i’d like to hear some opinions on my reasoning. i just don’t think that tesla can keep this insane growth up forever.

current positions: SMH, AMD, AAPL, PLTR, TCEHY

EDIT: **I've decided that I want to buy into arkk and arkf** and then arkg and possibly arkw later down the line. Thank you to the people who actually helped change my mind on this. I still will never touch tesla shares but I am definitely willing to buy into the ark funds now despite the fact that tesla is the top holding in most of them. **However, the whole Cathie Wood possibly leaving the company situation scares me.**_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Quick Market Analysis - Price, Volume, and Options flow for $SPY, $QQQ I was doing some analysis on **$SPY** and **$QQQ** for our twitter followers but wanted to share it here as well since the findings are quite interesting. Please note that this is not financial advice - these are just my two cents on what's happening and what might come in the next few days/weeks/months.

Please also note that I have no position in $SPY so this is just some interesting analysis, nothing else.

# Price & Volume

Let us first take a look at the price and volume for SPY and QQQ.

$**SPY Price and Volume Chart with Anchored VWAP:** [https://i.imgur.com/3y3sbMP.png](https://i.imgur.com/3y3sbMP.png)

$**QQQ Price and Volume Chart with Anchored VWAP:** [https://i.imgur.com/kp7gxMR.png](https://i.imgur.com/kp7gxMR.png)

Some very interesting observations here from the bull run of November.

* For both SPY and QQQ, price has rallied quite well in the last month. However, volume is drying up quickly. This previous happened in the August rally which was totally nullified in September. Are we going to have something similar soon?
* Low volume also indicates that smart money is not participating in the rally which can be a troublesome sign.
* VWAP for both SPY and QQQ is actually significantly lower than the current price. This means the volume is not supporting the price at all. 

# Options Flow Analysis

Increase in open interest illustrates investor's behavior towards a stock. OI is actually very important for options because it can show you a trend of whether people are starting to open more CALL contracts or PUT contracts. Let's see if there's a trend in SPY and QQQ puts from last week.

**$SPY Open Interest for the last 7 Days:** [https://i.imgur.com/IIXQcwL.png](https://i.imgur.com/IIXQcwL.png)

**$QQQ Open Interest for the last 7 Days:** [https://i.imgur.com/x3679BL.png](https://i.imgur.com/x3679BL.png)

An additional table here would be the total premiums spent on each options contract for $QQQ - [https://i.imgur.com/rCvZpBW.png](https://i.imgur.com/rCvZpBW.png).

What do we see here? Well, for both **SPY** and **QQQ**, ***PUT open interest is gradually increasing while CALL open interest remains the same.*** That means people are more interesting in opening more PUT contracts right now than CALL contracts. Now, there can be several reasons for this but one of them is a slightly bearish outlook by investors.

&#x200B;

**TLDR - Volume is not supporting the recent rally in both SPY and QQQ. Moreover, open interest for PUTs has been steadily increasing which can indicate a slightly bearish outlook.**

Happy to hear your thoughts on this._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Where to trade? I recently came into some money, and I plan on investing it.

I already use Cash App, but I wasn't sure if I should continue with larger sums of money. 

Does it really matter or should I use something like E-Trade for larger volume?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Which is better for Pre-IPO shares: Carta, Forge, Equity Zen or buying direct from employees Has anyone used any of these companies to buy Pre-IPO shares? Or is it better to directly solicit an employee at a Pre-IPO unicorn company. I missed out on a few opportunities this year and want to make sure I do not miss out in the future.

How does one evaluate fair share price Pre-IPO. Is there a calculator for this?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ I draw with crayons so you don't have to. Last week I closed up $1,250 or $1.5% while the market dipped 1%. Tickers on the watchlist this week: HYLN, NIO, U, OSTK, WKHS, CODX I'm back again with the tickers that are on my watchlist for next week. This week I closed up roughly $1,250 which was about 1.5% of my buying power. The market indices were -1% this week, so I out-performed them (again).

**What am I doing?**

I do technical analysis and selling cash-secured-puts 1 to 4 weeks out on stocks that are nearing key levels of support. My goal is to collect premium, but should I get assigned I have absolutely zero problem running the wheel on stocks I want to own. As a backstory I nearly blew up my account doing WSB-style plays in March but have regained all of my account and then some running this strategy since April. What I do now is basically wheeling on weekly puts.

I watch over 200 stocks, I would say its 90% waiting game and 10% true technical analysis. My levels work, but it's normally because I am patiently waiting for an entry point. Yes that's a lot of tickers to watch, but I research my stocks on weekends and then monitor additional plays & levels during the weekday to see if there is an obvious setup I want to participate in.

**Here's a few things regarding my strategy**

**1.** I don't over-leverage with spreads because if the stock price blows past your long strike and you assume max loss you need a lot of capital to actually be assigned the shares. For that reason I don't really see selling multiple spreads as a "Theta Gang" play and is still very high risk. If I do open a spread it will be a protective put for $1-5 just to protect myself should the company randomly announce bankruptcy.

**2.** I only sell cash-secured puts with the capability to be assigned if need be. My goal is to never take a loss on a position and always wheel it back to profitability. If something has changed fundamentally with the stock then yes I will close the position and realize the loss.

**3.** If IV on a ticker is very low, then yes I will outright buy shares instead.

**4.** I only aim for 1-4% per week collecting on theta and an occasional earnings theta yolo. No call-buying, no spreads (unless buying a covered put), only put-selling and shares!

Honestly, that's about it. I'll go through some tickers on my watchlist this weekend and what I currently have open.

# Open Positions From Last Week

**CRM:** My CRM put will be assigned at roughly down 3% from my cost basis. I will sell a covered call after the open tomorrow expiring, this week or next depending on premiums and also what the shares open at.

**DKNG:** Up 40% here, looking on a continuation of the trend to close around 60-70%. Earning $25 on theta per day anyways.

**FROG:** This position is completely flat. I still like the entry so will hold and keep an eye out to see what happens.

**PLTR:** up 15% on the puts I sold. Highly volatile stock with 10% intraday swings. With the government contracts they just signed I think there will be continued upside here. I'm HODLing until I can get 70-80% profit then I'll close to free up some buying power.

**RKT:** Up 50%, this is one green day from being 60-70% profit and then I will close. **Here's the thing:** what happens if RKT begins to go down closer to my strike? As long as it goes down slowly, both delta and theta will increase. So each day that passes when it gets closer to my strike price I will start to gain more value with theta. Every day that passes my contract gets more exposure to delta as well, so any bounce to the upside will put me in a good spot to close it out. Once the stock price starts to rise too far from my strike and I've gained 60-70% profit, the theta and delta values both drop leaving me to gain only a few dollars per day. Right now my contracts give me $14 per day in theta. If RKT opens green tomorrow my position will hit my 60-70% target and daily gain from theta will be $2-3, so why hold it when I'm not earning anything?

**TDOC:** Up 55%. This position was slightly red last week on the dip. Similar to PLTR I have faith in the fundamentals on this stock. Dips will be bought and $190 is a good floor.

# Master Plays This Week

I just want to preface this by saying these are not recommendations to buy or sell any stocks. These are stocks that have come through my scanner and met a few criteria for me to sell puts to collect premium. I won't execute on every trade, but if the timing is right I will enter these, that's why they are on my "watchlist". My intention here is to sell the put, collect the premium, or get assigned the shares. If I am assigned the shares, I sell covered-calls trying to lower my cost basis and remain profitable on the play.

**HYLN - Hyliion**

[HYLN chart](https://imgur.com/PjaAR8N)

HYLN, formerly $HLL ticker that merge'd via [SP@C](mailto:SP@C). This ticker has been on my radar for a few weeks now, but I never quite pulled the trigger. I would have thought a base would form around the $21 level, but here at $17 I think it is prime for a reversal. I will be looking at selling the $15 strike put for January to give myself a bit more time. IV still very high in this name.

**Positions on the watchlist:**

1. Jan 15, 2021 $15 strike put sold for $1.40 or $140 premium. Return: \~10%

&#x200B;

**NIO - Nio Inc**

[NIO chart](https://imgur.com/SAkcXmt)

NIO is down roughly 25% from the highs. For me, $40 could be a good place to form a base and sell some puts 1 or 2 strikes below. News of China required more strict financial audits has hurt a lot of Chinese stocks. IMO companies like BABA, NIO, JD are all legit and I don't see them getting de-listed due to above reasons. The lines I drew on this chart is actually from last week and the stocks seems to be flirting with my support line at the lower end of the channel/trend. A hold here would be bullish to see a reversal back to the upside.

**Positions on the watchlist:**

1. Jan 15, 2021 $38 strike put sold for $3.75 or $375 premium. Return: \~10%

&#x200B;

**U - Unity**

[Unity chart](https://imgur.com/8svcBwi)

Unity IPO'd earlier this fall. It's been on a non-stop trek upward since and hasn't consolidated much along the way. The 10% drop last week gives a better entry point for the continuation in trend. If the price breaks below $138 or so, we could see more downside to lower $130's for consolidation. January puts offering very nice premiums on this solid company.

**Positions on the watchlist:**

1. Jan 15, 2021 $140 strike put sold for $13.50 or $1,350 premium. Return: \~9%
2. Shares and covered calls to collect premium from high IV.

&#x200B;

**OSTK - Overstock**

[OSTK chart](https://imgur.com/4HshYve)

Overstock was a 12-bagger from June to September and then the massive blow-off-top happened. The stock has been in the range of $55-70 since then, but looks to be consolidating recently. This was on my "watchlist" last week, but I saw better opportunities to be played. The stock is currently nearing the bottom of the trend and touching support, $53-55 looks like a good entry point for me with selling the $50 put.

**Positions on the watchlist:**

1. Jan 15, 2021 $50 strike put sold for $3.75 or $375 premium. Return: \~7.5%
2. Shares with a stop-loss around $40 and a target to take profit around $75.

&#x200B;

**WKHS - Workhorse**

[WKHS Chart](https://imgur.com/zxHR31t)

WKHS had a big gap-down recently and is trading at the very bottom of the upward trend. It's got support one dollar below current levels and could be primed for a reversal back up. IV super high on this one as well.

**Positions on the watchlist:**

1. Jan 15, 2021 $19 strike put sold for $1.75 or $175 premium. Return: 9%
2. Shares with a stop-loss at $19 and profit taking target around $25.

&#x200B;

**CODX**

[CODX Chart](https://imgur.com/lukNaiS)

Lastly we have CODX. The stock has taken an absolutely massive beating dropping from $31 in September to it's current price of $10. A 66% decline in just 3 months. Looking at chart, in my opinion, the selling looks to be coming close to an end. I think it will form a base around $10 or possibly $8 if it falls through the $10 support level. This is somewhat of a high-risk play, but premiums are nice and I am looking for a bounce.

**Positions on the watchlist:**

1. Jan 15, 2021 $9 strike put sold for $1.05 or $105 premium. Return: \~12%
2. Shares here could be a less risky play if you don't like volatility. I could see a bounce here back to $15 in the next 2-3 months if things go well for the stock._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ LULU- haven’t seen much discussion Hey y’all!

I’ve been thinking of buying LULU for a month or so now since their affluent customer base at this point is more resistant to the consequences of the pandemic if they have made it this far.

They took a 6% drop after positive earnings... anyone holding LULU or have opinions on this company?  Thinking I might try to start entering tomorrow._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_
