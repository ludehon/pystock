CURRENTLY DEEP RED but I‚Äôm a diamond-handed mother fucker so I ain‚Äôt scared._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Pour some out for the Palantir gang... _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Very bullish on $BBBY, DD included  Here's some DD for you people for an amazing play, the findings are from articles and their SEC filings which i looked trough.

BBBY - Bed, Bath and Beyond, has great potential. My last quick DD was $SOLO at $2.9, anyone who got in would have made some nice cash. I'm not guaranteeing or saying this will be the exact same, but i am very bullish on this stock for the next months.

As others have pointed out, they have had a new CEO for about a year. He has really gotten things rolling.

**#1**. They have been streamlining operations, meaning selling off unprofitable and outdated assets. This was asked for by analysts for multiple years, and the new CEO finally has done so. The great thing about this is, they managed to sell their assets for what was called a surprising amount \[1\] considering the state they were in ($245m for christmas tree shops, a useles brick and mortar chain that they aquired for $200m \[2\]), and a lot of the sales **will be reflected in the q4 earnings on 7. January as they fell into this quarter**. Also the operating costs of these assets will no longer press on the financial results, which will boost the results yOy especially considering that some of the assets were niche brick and mortar locations that would not have generated proper revenue in q4 anyway.

**#2** Their **q3 results were INCREDIBLY promising.** They had a **89% increase in digital sales** \[3\]. This is a direct result of the restructuring and will continue in q4.

**#3** They have **126m outstanding shares,** and have an **already authorized share repurchase** agreement **for $825 million** \[4\]. **$375m** of that will be purchased with an **ACCELERATED share repurchase program by no later than 27.2.2021.**

**#4 Institutions seem to be incredibly bullish on this.** If you look at 13F filings for BBBY ( [https://fintel.io/so/us/bbby](https://fintel.io/so/us/bbby) ), there is an **ocean of institutions buying** BBBY, but close to NONE selling.

**#5** **76% of the float is short (as of 14.12). Together with the incoming earnings, the MASSIVE shares repurchase program (within months), institutions being super bullish and the restructuring this is bound to force the shorts to cover their asses.** Even without the shorts this would be a great value play, this is only the cherry on top.

Risks: Shorts pushing down the stock before it pops. Theres been many great earnings reports where shorts have managed to push the stock down before it moons, but i find this to be a rather small risk. Especially if this gains any traction, this will snowball as fuck. Go shares if you want to minimize, but this will be an awesome stock for the next months.

**tl:dr: BBBY is in a great position to moon as their restructuring, sales, and massive acclerated share repurchase program and interest of institutions will fuck the shorts over.**

**Positions: Shares (yes), 15/1/21 22.5 Calls**. Will gather up more before earnings most certainly.

Most of the other info can be found in their SEC filings aswell, articles are simply easyer to read._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ BBBY earnings and technical play My last technical play [FCEL](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kghrjf/fcel_bull_flag_breakout/) worked out  so well (reached my 50% gain price target within a week), so I wanted to share a new play with hopes of recreating that magic. This one's a little different in that I'm entering sooner than I normally would, so I would start small and average in.

BBBY is exhibiting a wedge pattern and is on the verge of breaking out. Normally, I would wait for a confirmed  breakout with volume before getting in, but BBBY reports earnings on 1/7/21, so it might be too late to get in with a good price due to earnings IV pump. For reference, BBBY beat its last earning projection, and I would expect it to do well this quarter too. It's found good support at the low $18's, so unless it drops way below that, it's a low risk play to get in now imho. As an added bonus, like our darling GME, BBBY has a decent short interest too, so an earnings smash has the possibility for a good old squeeze.

I would look for post 1/7 calls with relatively low IV. 2/19 is probably the earliest I would go for now, with March a safer choice. Price target is difficult since it hasn't broken out yet, but I would put a conservative $26 target, and over $30 on an earnings blowout.

\*12/29/ update - I'm still waiting for the breakout but the ending was encouraging. We hit the 20 SMA (red line) in the morning before falling, but found support in the same low 18's we've had the entire wedge. Turning the 20 SMA from a resistance to a support is critical. February calls between 22 to 25 looked decent today, and I would even consider up to 30 for the March dates. For now, I've started a small 2/19 25C position and will look to continue adding every day. If we fall under $17 at any time, this play might need reconsideration.

GME üöÄüöÄüöÄ_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $LULU to the moon and here is why What's up retards, long time lurker and full time tendiemaker here. LULU is going to go full meme stock in the next 6 months and here is why. 

# Technicals

Okay let's get this out of the way for the idiots out there like me who thrive on Technical Analysis. Even the dumbest of us can see that LULU has been going straight up as far back as Robinhood allows you to go. It shows a clear reverse downtrend pattern, and is in the process of doing the double batman pattern. For you newbies out there, this means our trusty sidekick Robin(hood) is telling us to buy calls.

# Fundamentals

If you are an even bigger bullshitter, you'll know that Technical Analysis is for people that use the stairs. If you park in the blue and use the easy access ramp, then I know you are like me and check out the Fundamentals. 

1. LULU has basically always had incredible earnings reports, constantly beating analyst expectations. Furthermore, their stock price continues to increase the following quarter after a strong earnings report. Guess what? Earlier this month, they BLASTED earnings, beating expectations. You'll notice that all of 2020, their stock price has gone down immediately after posting earnings, but then will shoot back up in no time. The price has been going down because LULU has not issued guidance, siting COVID as the reason for uncertainty. But EVERY time this happens, the stock goes down and EVERY time LULU proves investors wrong by keeping a strong supply chain. 
2. Don't believe me that LULU is a good buy? Those of you who have TDAmeritrade should check out the "Fundamentals" Tab under analysis. Analyst ratings are all on ACCUMULATE and BUY. 
3. How about Price Targets? Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Deutsche Bank, and Barclays all raised LULU's Price Targets this month, with Morgan Stanley joining them a few days later. The highest price target is by JPM at $442. LULU is trading at \~$355 as I am writing this. And if you follow price targets closely, you should know that these big banks like to have conservative price targets so that they are more likely to hit their targets and don't look stupid to investors. If JPM is saying $442, what they really mean is $500+++
4. Do you guys know the CEO, Calvin McDonald? This guy is an all star and everyone loves him. Since he became CEO in 2018, LULU has been going PARABOLIC. This guy is basically the Lisa Su of athleisure, and I know how you weebs love Su Bae.

&#x200B;

# DD

1. Have you guys ever been inside a fucking Lululemon store? I went over the holidays to do some shopping with my tendies, and there was a huge ass line and stuff was flying off the shelves. I couldn't find half of the stuff in my size. I talked to the store associate and they said that they get inventory EVERY DAY, and that I could come back the next day. I did first thing in the morning and there was my size of stretchy chino pants for $128. Now think about it: does this sound like a company that has issues with supply chain or demand to you? Absolutely not. I guarantee their Q4 earnings are going to be insane.
2. Who are LULU's customers? Rich girls and boys with daddy's money who want to spend $100 on a fucking shirt. These aren't people who are hurting from losing their robs, these are people who are cooped up indoors and want to online shop so that when this summer comes around and everyone has vaccines, they have a ton of new stretchy expensive athletic wear to show off to the world. All the rich people with their new pelotons want something to spend their money on, and it's Lululemon. 
3. Have you ever worn these pants? They are insanely comfy and I look good as hell. I'm gonna buy more, and I showed my friends and family and they are all going to get some too. My wife is even buying some for her boyfriend and getting the alterations done free in-store.

just wanted to add my two cent to the current discussion around GME and offer an explanation to what the fuck has been going on ever since the jump.

As you all know, there are a lot of hedge funds on the opposote side, shorting the shit out of GME. As we all know, they were already short at USD 6, so they completely drowning now, that we hit USD 20. 

On important thing to keep in mind, is that annual bonuses are extremely important for hedge funds and annual performance for 2020 will largely determine how much money they can raise for next year.

So in synopsis, these funds will do everything to keep the price level down until the end of the year! They will fight, manipulate and pull up every trick they now to keep that motherfucker down.

To all retards, which own stocks, that means you still have a couple of days to load up on stocks at the end of the trading day, when prices converge back to USD 20. My prediction is, that there will be a huge breakout in January, most likely after the conference or after christmas sales announcement.

For everyone, who worries about the recent price rise, keep in mind, that the company is still trading at 0.3x revenues, which is pretty much a distressed valuation.

My prediction is the following:

- min. USD 30 in January 
- min. USD 40 after Q4 earnings
- min. USD 60 at year end (roughly 1x revenues)
- infinity after Cohen becomes the new CEO

Bless you_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ When friends ask me, what is going with PLTR? _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Novus Capital SPAC (read: AppHarvest) Alright so apologies in advance if this isn't good enough to be here with what I include. As a prelude to this, I am a professional within the industry this stock operates in, not quite an autist retard who has stumbled across a cool stock. 

So, AppHarvest is an agri-tech company that is soon to be going public. They operate large greenhouses in Kentucky. They have already had a huge amount of funding over the past two years, completed their first greenhouse construction a few months back and planted their first crop. They have already started on their next greenhouse which will double their capacity. They grow fresh produce 365 days a year, their location allows them to access about 75% of the US population within a 10 hour drive (which is absolutely huge in terms of freshness and driving sales).

They are going to be marketing their produce under one of the bigger brands over there in USA/Canada (Sunset Produce), I don't believe this to be a huge factor because ultimately demand>supply with their specific product to the market. But, it still helps to have a popular label for sure.

They operate high tech greenhouses, which have been perfected in Holland as a profitable business. The private investment in Europe for high tech greenhouses is huge, the returns are consistent and reliable and the thing is, the margins in the US are even greater because you're not bound to a lot of the rules in force in the EU. Energy price is a very big one, overall per KwH in the US at the moment you're literally looking at 30-50% cheaper electricity than places like Holland and the UK. Energy is the biggest cost next to labour within greenhouse grown produce and we still make it work over here.

Considering AppHarvest have plans to basically triple their current operations (at least) over the next 5 years or so, I don't see how getting in on Novus Capital before it merges and becomes AppHarvest isn't a good bet.

The information at the minute about an actual merger date isn't there, the best that has been said is before the end of Q4. Personally, I understand they planted their first tomato crop in November, which by my reckoning means they will have their first saleable produce by mid-late January, so I can see it happening around the time their first produce hits the shelves.

I've written this as a professional within the industry, although from the UK. Whether that means anything around here, probably not. But at least as far as it not being a great DD post then yeah, I say it so I can indeed answer further questions on why I believe it's a very good bet. It's a business that by default offers long term, reliable returns, with the added benefit of significant short term expansion plans.

I always see on here a shit tonne of posts as soon as there's some fresh news within the cannabis industry. Well look at it this way, the high tech cannabis growing companies are run by ex-fresh produce growers, utilising technology built for growing fresh produce, only with this we aren't waiting on legislation._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Options Trading vs. Sports Betting - Pretty Darn Similar? Don't really know exactly the point of this post. I do both since online gambling legalized in my state and am just consistently amazed by this. Hope everyone finds it insightful. Feel free to ask me any questions / make other points.

Online sports betting is now legal in a variety of states (most legalized this year) & is rapidly expanding to others. Sports betting is very, very similar to derivatives trading.¬†

**Similarities:**

\- It's a f'ing thrill.

\- The markets move, *quickly*. We see this in derivatives trading with earnings, regulation changes, central bank policy, etc. Volatility can shoot up or crash down, the underlying price moves as people trade, expressing their opinions in the market. Similarly, the Ravens may be -400 before the game, but Lamar gets COVID and they're quickly -200. Or sharp bettors come in and massively move a line. In trading & sports betting, you are using mathematics, statistics and all of the information you have at the time to make informed "trades" (e.g. bets).

\- This isn't investing where you're holding for years and hoping to realize some expected return. Especially for weekly/daily expirations, it's super similar to sports betting in that usually you know whether you were right or wrong fairly quickly. If you're buying a call option on AAPL for earnings, you'll know shortly after that earnings call if you're winning or losing. Just like buying an NBA team in a game and checking the score in the 1Q.

\-You're trading/betting against algorithms.

\- You can win. We see all the time here people consistently making money trading derivatives. It's the same in sports. This isn't slots or roulette; you can beat the house.

**Differences:**

\- US sportsbooks are inefficient markets.¬†Arbitrage exists. You can't go onto Fidelity and buy an option for $1 while simultaneously selling it for $1.10 on Robinhood. You can in sports betting; the¬†books all have different, independent lines.¬†

¬†\- Promotions exist; a lot of these sportsbooks (such as DraftKings, a $20 billion company) offer hundreds of dollars in site credit to new users when they join._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Perion - Very Undervalued with MASSIVE upside If you missed the run on Magnite, or The Trade Desk then here's your chance to invest in the advertising space that will crush the market in 2021. Perion recently extended the deal with Microsoft and has been working with MSFT for over 10 years.

\- Perion raised its Q4 revenue to $100M-$105M from $81M-$91M vs. $86.14M consensus

\- Stellar Q3 earnings. Beats on revenue and EPS. Revenue growth of 27% YoY

\- Company is well-positioned to reap the benefits of ads increase in the CTV space

\- Consistently has been decreasing debts every quarte

\- ARK has consistently increased its position in this stock and currently has over 200k shares in its Israel Innovative Technology ETF

\- Partnership with Microsoft has definitely provided brand recognition

\- The digital advertising and CTV space has been red hot in 2020 and has more than enough reasons to attract more $$$$$ in 2021

\- As of 12/28, the stock has taken a massive dip so it's trading at an unbelievable discounted price and options are very cheap too!

\- WAYYYYY undervalued stock right now when compared against its competitors:

1. EV/Revenue = 1.3x (vs 59x for TTD or 19x for MGNI)
2. Price/Sales = 0.55x (vs 61x for TTD or 14x for MGNI)

They sold lot of non-core stuff - sold [personlizationmall.com](https://personlizationmall.com), one kings lane, christmas tree shops, etc - the company went from 1.2B in debt to 200m in cash. They have also done a lot of changes to improve the business like reduce inventory, add omnichannel support, beyond+ - like prime, etc. The company posted positive comps. \*\* There is a 170 page [investor day presentation](http://bedbathandbeyond.gcs-web.com/static-files/2730f3a3-1969-414e-bd30-3fcf49e321d4) to see all the changes have done and will be doing \*\*

It trades dirty cheap - 9B+ in sales, 900m in profit expected. 2.34B market cap. 200m net cash.

They have a $825m share buyback going on (upsized from $650m) ! Large part of this is Accelerated Share Repurchase (short term). Remember 61% short - this ASR is bound to kill shorts !

Virgin Galactic made headlines a few weeks ago due to an aborted launch. The stock price fell from a high of $35 down to $24 because of the launch hype and subsequent failure. Naturally, people are spooked at the idea of a bunch of billionaires exploding in the sky. So what happened with the failed launch?



‚ÄúVirgin Galactic is now conducting post flight analysis and can so far report that the onboard computer which monitors the propulsion system lost connection, triggering a fail-safe scenario that intentionally halted ignition of the rocket motor.  This system, like others on the spaceship, is designed such that it defaults to a safe state whenever power or communication with sensors is lost.‚Äù





That means the safety systems in the rocket *worked* the way they were supposed to. The launch was canceled because of a bad connection. 




‚ÄúBut Bilbo,‚Äù you say ‚Äúwhat if this means the company is a bust?‚Äù





Don‚Äôt be a fucking gay bear. This company literally makes rockets that blast into space. What more DD do you want? But if that‚Äôs not convincing enough...



‚ÄùWe remain focused on the test flight program we have previously announced, beginning with a repeat of this test flight, which included two pilots and NASA payloads.  This will be followed by another test flight which will include mission specialists in the cabin.   And following that flight, we will have another test flight which will include our founder, Sir Richard Branson.‚Äù




That‚Äôs right, Sir Dick himself is going to space. When these launches hit in 2021, you retards are going to want to FOMO in. Don‚Äôt be an idiot, buy now.

But I have come to an impasse. 

I‚Äôve thought long and hard about this in the past 3 minutes and have decided to leave the fate of my relationship up to WSB pumping the market. Instead of buying an engagement ring for my girlfriend, I‚Äôm going to buy $GME 50x 1/22/21 $22c and hope to God that it works.

Edit: clarifying my position

$GME 50x 1/22/21 $22c_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ The Big Short Squeeze - QS Tl;dr Don't long underlying stock; if you're bullish on QS then buy calls to short squeeze, sell puts to collect very expensive premium.

First off, if you're long QS stock on Robinhood, you're a moron flushing money down the toilet.

Why? Consider this: an ATM Feb put goes for around $50, call for $10 (300% vs. 70% IV). Meaning that a synthetic stock position (short put + long call), which has an identical payoff as a long underlying stock, gives a guaranteed $40 extra compared to a long underlying position. This is usually arbitraged away by the law of put-call parity: do a synthetic stock, then short underlying. Problem is, stock borrow rates are off the roof.

Quick review of put-call parity, skip if you hate math: `C-P=F*S-K,` where C=call price, P=put price, S=stock price, K=strike price F = future value rate (based on risk-free interest). Using Feb 110 strike price, this gives us an implied future value at 78. Alternatively, we see that put price = call price at approximately 88 strike. Compare that to the $115 price as of writing. The way I interpret this is, even if you're bearish, the market has already priced in a drop to the 80s.

Currently the lending interest is 600%. Six hundred. Fucking. Percent. Seeing as Robinhood doesn't have a share lending program, and retail brokers that do have a lending program typically skim off 50% of interest earned, and considering the ability to construct a synthetic long position on a stock that doesn't pay dividends, buying the underlying rather than a synthetic position (or ya know, staying out entirely) is just plain dumb. Unless, of course, you can lend and your broker is paying you the 600% interest.

In fact, ATM puts are trading at 5x calls as of writing. If you want to break even if Feb expires at spot, which is the payoff of a long stock anyways, you could long 5 calls for every 1 put you short ATM, giving you a 5x payoff upside vs. a 1x payoff downside, rather than a 1:1 payoff of long stock. My options position (see below) has a similar payoff characteristic.

On the other hand, the more QS shares are held in Robinhood accounts, the shorter the supply of lendable shares, which increases short squeeze pressure due to the above. So the people who are holding QS but not lending them are collectively helping the squeeze. So hopefully this post doesn't reach enough people to hurt my position.

Also, with a 600% interest, consider the ease at which the shorts can be squeezed. Let's say their call is correct, that QS eventually goes down to $60, even $40. But let's say their timing is off, and that QS stays steady or increases for a while before crashing. The lending interest they need to pay forces them to buy more shares to cover, which also bids up share price.

Another point: when you buy calls, the market-maker on the other side of the trade must buy the underlying stock, which is known as Delta hedging. Only problem is, when stock moves up big, shorting calls = need to buy even more stock to remain Delta neutral. So you can imagine this positive feedback loop: the more QS goes up, the more market makers need to buy QS, further driving up demand and bidding up price. This phenomenon is called Gamma chase.

As long as these two short-term factors are driving demand, QS may continue to skyrocket. When the shorts have covered, lending rates are back to normal, and gamma shorts have closed their positions, it's time to wind down or get out entirely.

FAQ: Aren't current QS valuations crazy high? Yes they absolutely fucking are. But if there's any lesson I've learned by staying on the sidelines watching TSLA go to the moon, it's that fundamentals hardly matters in our current market conditions. It's all supply and demand, based on hype. And I'd say the hype for QS may have only just begun.

FAQ: Isn't QS just the next Nikola, doomed to fail because of an overhyped technology and sketchy leadership? Doubt it. I searched their employees on LinkedIn. A few of them are my classmates from engineering school. Jagdeep Singh is no Trevor Milton, he's been the founder and CEO of several legit tech companies in the past. And the technology is endorsed by well-respected Stanford engineering professors. Bill Gates and Volkswagen, the latter being the traditional car manufacturer that has made the most effort to catch up to Tesla in EVs, have major stakes too. It's not the next gravity-powered nonsense. So QS won't crash due to a NKLA-type scandal.

This doesn't mean a correction won't happen in the short term; in fact, I think it's the most likely case. But in the meantime, the stock can easily continue to skyrocket, allowing you to cash out your relatively cheap calls in the meantime.

So what's the strategy? I opened as many credit put spreads (Feb exp) until maximum notional at risk is around 10% of my entire portfolio value. Basically, you wanna short ATM/NTM put options (I like 40-60 delta) to collect maximum credit, but cover your downside by buying back an OTM put (I like 5-20 delta). I then use some of the proceeds to buy 16-40 delta call options, ranging from FDs to 1 or 2-months, up to 3% of my portfolio value. The idea of buying shorter-term calls is, I think the spike caused by short squeeze and gamma chase may be faster than the correction. The point at which I'll exit this trade is when lending interest is back to reasonable levels, i.e. when put-call parity starts to hold again. This is the point at which short squeeze has less pressure, the most likely point that allows this crazy bubble to deflate. Of course this may happen sooner, but that's why you cap the downside.

Compared to my max loss, this position is giving me a 1 to 1 payoff at a +0.5std move, 5 to 1 at +1std, 50 to 1 at +2std.

It's pretty degenerate to bet on an obviously overvalued company to continue rising. So I wouldn't risk more than 15% of my portfolio value at a time on this position. Instead of letting your winners ride, I would cash out and rebalance whenever it moves in your favor. For example, on Monday I entered the above position when it opened at $75 (sadly, I didn't discover this trade before). By Tuesday it was trading at $115, I made a 150% profit and cashed out my newly ITM calls enough so that I was once again risking 10% max loss, and re-bought more OTM calls. So in the worst case scenario I'm still above breakeven with this trade overall.

Maybe my very first WSB post will age poorly, and QS collapses soon after I post this. But I stand by this strategy, seeing as I'm already guaranteed to be above breakeven, despite having been very late to this party._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Every morning I wake up to great news about how well the Moderna vaccine is doing _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ JOYY is a fraud Ticker is Y Y.

The most famous earners on JOYY are terribly uninteresting and literally sit around doing nothing while broadcasting. Muddy Waters alleges that a lot of the "gifts" are from bots and/or are recycled from users or are being gifted by themselves. 

It has a market cap of 6.4 B which seems a lot for chinese Reddit streams. It has been falling pretty steadily for the last few weeks.

&#x200B;

* **Why the hell are you comparing SGMO with CRSP?** You‚Äôve probably heard of CRSPR but never heard of SGMO. Doesn‚Äôt fucking matter, because‚Ä¶ PATENTS. CRSPR tech got a lot of attention and press in its early days, mostly from a Radiolab episode and then lots of follow-up news stories. It‚Äôs used a lot of places for research because it's cheap and widely available... and that‚Äôs the whole problem. So many institutions use CRSPR and publish improvements and modifications to the technique/process that the legal landscape is a goddamn patent quagmire (giggity).

&#x200B;

* **Don‚Äôt believe me that CRSP‚Äôs patent game is weaksauce?** Check out this link: [Crispr patents by institution.](https://www.investorvillage.com/smbd.asp?mb=1933&mn=153484&pt=msg&mid=21490140) It has a 2019 table put out by IPlytics showing the # of crispr patents owned by different companies/institutions.

The first two companies are big agra.

The next 4 are UCSF, Harvard, MIT, and UPenn.

Right after that is SGMO.

CRSP isn‚Äôt even on the goddamn map.

&#x200B;

* **So SGMO owns the patents covering some of the IP CRSP is trying to use?** YES FUCKING YES \*bangs table\*. At least they sure AF do for this one covering BCL11A promotor genes: [https://www.investorvillage.com/smbd.asp?mb=1933&mn=153565&pt=msg&mid=21490140](https://www.investorvillage.com/smbd.asp?mb=1933&mn=153565&pt=msg&mid=21490140)

&#x200B;

* **What‚Äôs a BCL11A promotor gene?** I highly doubt at anyone really gives a shit, but it is a nucleotide strand that causes increased expression of genetic material following its locus in a DNA strand. If you can target insertion of it ‚Äúin front of‚Äù the gene you want to express (maybe genetic material encoding clotting factor in hemophilia) it ramps up expression of the subsequent gene. It doesn‚Äôt really matter. What does matter is that SGMO has a shiny new patent on it and CRSP is going to get taken to town (and not to have a lovely date at Olive Garden) by all the other IP departments of universities and SGMO if they ever manage to get a therapy approved.

&#x200B;

* **Rake, no big pharma company would be so stupid that they marketed a therapy covered by another company‚Äôs patent, right????** Well, Merck had to pay Bristol-Myers Squibb a one-time settlement of 625 million and subsequent sales royalties of 6.5 percent the first 5 years to market, and 2.5 percent the next 2 years on market for Keytruda (pembrolizumab) because BMS had IP protection on the use of anti-PD-1 antibodies.

&#x200B;

* **That must‚Äôve been a one-off screw up, right?** Unfortunately not. Kite had to pay Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 752 million for IP infringement surrounding Yescarta. That was after Gilead paid 11.9 billion to acquire Kite.

Both patent disasters are detailed in this IV article: [https://www.investorvillage.com/smbd.asp?mb=1933&mn=153598&pt=msg&mid=21490140](https://www.investorvillage.com/smbd.asp?mb=1933&mn=153598&pt=msg&mid=21490140)

&#x200B;

* **Of note, SGMO‚Äôs proprietary gene-editing technology, Zinc-finger-nucleases, are wholly owned proprietary tech.** And it has [better precision and specificity than CRSPR](https://t.co/uKtI6vrAeb__;!!Cjnu1T6GFXg!6oZ04-OqlWutwVsIdNAOAKQ-IlWoIkV_CL4WnJbLO1Q-WZ02b883DiQUGphgBOdnxRvphNk3Wg$).

&#x200B;

* **Why are they letting CRSP develop the tech and bring it to market?** You make more money that way? Patent trolling is pretty reprehensible, but if you can just let someone else put in all the money for development and clinical trials and marketing and FDA approval, then just sue them for royalties, you‚Äôre going to make a shit ton more than if you did the upfront work yourself.

&#x200B;

* **You mentioned ARKG?** Yeah, because SGMO isn‚Äôt included in it yet. But Takeda and Novartis (both partnered with SGMO) are. There is suspicion SGMO might make an appearance on the list soon because it‚Äôs massively undervalued, and it would only make sense to shift profits from all the other gene-therapy hockey-stick runups this year to diversify and invest in something with room to run. Don‚Äôt take it from me, [this analyst](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jo-mama-7774ba1bb) believes SGMO is a prime choice for inclusion in ARKG. If you reviewed his linked in profile you might be interested to know he also is overweight on DEEZ with an upside target of $69.

Got eem aside, if SGMO is included in ARKG it will experience a wicked bump in price just the like ARKG holding that has a low market cap and banned ticker that farms genetically modified salmon. They were at about $3-$4 a share for a loooooong time before ARKG inclusion and have since rocketed to a new normal of $9-$10 a share. The ticker starts with an ‚ÄúA‚Äù and ends with a ‚ÄúB‚Äù and theres a ‚ÄúQ‚Äù in the middle if you want to peep some hot price action.

Honestly, from what I can tell, it's mostly rumors at this point, but I highly doubt Our Lady of Gains Cathie Wood would not dip her toes in the SGMO pool.

&#x200B;

* **Shouldn‚Äôt funds like ARKG already know about SGMO?** I suspect they do, but way more importantly all the big pharma partners I mentioned earlier do. I said it before and I‚Äôll say it again- those guys know a hell of a lot more than I do about what works, and it‚Äôs probably the main crux of my thesis.

Unless SGMO‚Äôs CEO Sandy Macrae is Elizabeth Holmes 2.0 and this is a hilarious Sangameranos situation where I lose most of my retirement, things are looking pretty goddamn rosy.

And trust me, Sandy Macrae is nowhere near the level of charismatic as Elizabeth Holmes is. Excellent CEO, strong clinician focused on safety first, able to turn this company into a powerhouse through acquisitions (TxCell) and partnerships- yes. Charismatic, kinda hot with crazy eyes and deep Venture Brothers [Dr. Girlfriend](https://youtu.be/2rs7VVjz5A8__;!!Cjnu1T6GFXg!__RIcIDFTSmG7OdGlGLgvdEQh3gV5d43LeHXCqDyyIjUP28_p4pbc2G9jmchEUBAjRHnzHT4LA$) dominatrix voice like Mrs. Holmes- nope, not even close. Listening to this guy talk is like watching paint dry while you‚Äôre stuck in an elevator someone farted in, so I‚Äôm assuming he must actually be peddling something good. Macrae is selling the STEAK, not the SIZZLE.

&#x200B;

* **You seem to link a lot of IV articles, what‚Äôs up with that?** I‚Äôm just trying to distill down the important points for my fellow autists riding the short bus with me. PS, if my boy bct1192 from IV is reading this- much love, and know that ‚Äúundiagnosed autist‚Äù is a strong compliment in the parlance of this forum.

&#x200B;

* **Legit stacks? For real-real? Lunar Tendies?** Trust, WSB fam. I posted a YOLO screenshot in my first article before the pop this week, it was more than 51% of my IRA, and that‚Äôs just one of my 5 investment accounts.

**TL;DR summary**\- SGMO undervalued, owns the patents to CRSP. SGMO stock price should go up 4x to be equivalent market cap.

**TL;DR Investment moves**\- **Buy SGMO shares** since they are still relatively cheap, otherwise LEAP calls like **Jan ‚Äô22 $25 strike**.

Ontario Store Count: 

**Last Q: 150**  **This Q: 255**

Retail stores are the main driver of growth in the Canadian market, with most of the growth coming from store openings in Ontario. With a population of nearly 15 million people, it is by far the largest market in Canada(currently accounts for 28.6% of national sales) and up until June only had 70 retail stores open. As of December 1st there were 255 retail stores open, with 106 of those store openings coming during this quarter, a **71%** increase from the previous Q.

&#x200B;

[Store Openings this Q](https://preview.redd.it/a3dgzwnzgy761.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=d814583986fb7625298fccb7acf7498c2e29664f)

Health Canada releases sales data on the Canadian Recreational market every month, which effectively confirms that there is continued growth in the market. Sales increased in both September(2%) and October(5%) and I anticipate we see a larger jump in November due to a large amount of store openings in mid-October to early November. Aphria has shown its ability to continually grow with the Canadian market, as long as they maintain their industry leading market share in Canada we should see this trend continue.

My focus on branding is specific to 3 product categories; Dried Flower, Vapes and Pre-Rolls, which make up **86%** of Canadian sales. The data below was collected using Headset, which tracks the top 10 selling products by category, updated weekly.  

**Pre Rolls**\- 12% of the Canadian Market and 12% of Aphria‚Äôs Rec Revenues

**Kind Award**: Indica Pre-Roll of the Year: *RIFF*\- Subway Scientist

Aphria dominates the Pre-Roll market, their Jean Guy strain sat at #1 for the month of September and their Royal Highness strain took over the #1 spot for all of October and November. They boasted the top 6 best-selling products for September and maintained 4 of the top 5 spots for October and November. Aphria‚Äôs brands were #1 in pre-rolled market share in Canada last Q, a trend that will continue into this Q.

**Vapes**\- 15% of the Canadian Market and 14% of Aphria‚Äôs Rec Revenues

**Kind Award**: Indica Cartridge of the Year: *Good Supply*\- Purple Monkey 

Sativa Cartridge of the Year: *Good Supply*\- Tangie Kush

Hybrid Cartridge of the Year: *Good Supply*\- Pineapple Express

Another category that Aphria dominates, their Blue Dream strain held the #1 spot for the month of September while their Pineapple Express strain held onto #1 for October and November. They held 3 of top 5 best-selling vapes for September and October, and 2 of the top 5 spots for November. They had 4 products in the Top 10 from October to November and a recent PR stated they held their #1 market share position in both Ontario and Alberta in the last 3 months, ending Oct 31. 

**Dried Flower**\- 59% of Canadian Market and 58% of Aphria‚Äôs Rec Revenues

**Kind Award**: Craft Cannabis of the Year: *Broken Coast*

CBD Brand of the Year: *Solei*\- Free

Aphria has a strong presence in the Dried Flower market, with their Jean Guy strain being the #1 best-selling flower in October and November. They held 3 of the top 5 spots in September, 2 of the top 5 spots in October and 1 of the top 5 spots in November. At the end of August they launched their new discount brand B!NGO which targets the growing bulk-offering subcategory(15&28G offerings). This move immediately undercut all competitors by offering the cheapest large format options, with ounces as low as $4.18/G, all the while maintaining competitive prices with their *Good Supply, RIFF* and *Solei* products.  This will be this first quarter we see sales from these bulk offerings and its no doubt this move is intended to propel them from #2 in dried flower market share in Canada to #1. 

**Additional German Cannabis Revenue**

In early October Aphria made their first shipment of medical cannabis from their Canadian facility to Germany. This cannabis will be distributed through Germany by their pharmaceutical company CC Pharma, a leading distributor of pharmaceutical products, with more than 13,000 pharmacies in Germany and Europe. They also launched several new CBD wellness brands in Germany, CannRelief, Evoque and CannaPet. Products under the CannRelief brand consist of cosmetic oils, creams and supplements. Evoque provides natural and sustainable products, such as face creams and serums. CannaPet provides products designed to help with relaxation, relief and recovery of pets. All of these products are distributed through CC Pharma and will provide a new revenue stream for Aphria. 

**Speculative: MOON POTENTIAL**

***Georgia Senate Runoff***

The most important vote thus far in the cannabis industry. If the Democrats sweep the Jan 5 senate run-off election, they would flip senate control. This would be the largest catalyst for US legalization we have seen, and the sector hype will be all you guys talk about. With a Democrat majority in the Senate, the MORE Act; which would remove cannabis from the Controlled Substance Act would see the senate floor and likely pass; the bills sponsor is Vice President-elect Kamala Harris. The SAFE Banking Act would also hit the senate floor and likely pass, allowing banks to serve the Cannabis industry. Most importantly would be full on federal legalization, while Biden has supported decriminalization, a senate & house majority and nearly 60% of adults supporting legalization could push him towards federal legalization. 

***Aphria-Tilray Merger, Sweetwater acquisition***

Aphria has made a big splash in the US space in recent weeks, with the acquisition of Sweetwater Brewing and more recently merging with Tilray. SweetWater is one of the largest independent craft brewers in the US with flagship 420 beverages and award-winning beers. Aphria will immediately be able to sell beverages under the Solei and RIFF brands in the US with SweetWater‚Äôs distribution infrastructure, giving them a major entry into the beverage market. Tilray is a US based cannabis company, backed by WSB favourite Peter Thiel and a JV with alcohol giant Anheuser-Busch, but more famously known for its epic run to $300 in 2017. With a leading market share in Canada and a solid cash balance, they will be able to focus on the lucrative US market. Leveraging their connections with Anheuser-Busch, Peter Thiel and former CEO of WholeFoods Walter Robb makes them an attractive favourite among investors. The merger will effectively create the largest Cannabis company in the world, and both Aphria and Tilray are set to benefit if the democrats take control of the Senate on Jan 5. (US MSOs aren‚Äôt listed on major exchanges, cant trade options on them)

Docebo competes in the learning management system (LMS) market. Sounds complicated but to make it simpler, a learning management system is a software application covering the administration, documentation, tracking, reporting, automation, and delivery of¬†educational courses, training programs, or learning and development programs. Basically, if companies have employees, partners, or customers go through training courses of some kind, they go through the LMS software.

The corporate learning management system (LMS) market is a subset of the global e-learning market. According to various sources and Docebo‚Äôs management team, the global e-learning market is expected to reach $29.9bn by 2025. If true, this will be rapid growth from where the market is today. Management believes that enterprises see a correlation to ongoing learning opportunities to improved productivity, higher retention rates, and overall employee engagement and work satisfaction. Learning while on the job will always be important.

Management is comparing the LMS market to the early stages of the CRM market because just as the CRM market changed from non-essential to essential, the LMS market will make this transition. Initially, the LMS market was designed to host, deliver, track, and manage learning content. It's changing to new learning functionalities like social learning, learning on the job, and communities of practice/workgroups designed to drive organizational change. One of the potential tailwinds of the learning management system market is how remote work and the COVID-19 pandemic will impact this industry. As more employees work from home, a platform like this to help teach new employees may be critical to the success of a company or division.

Docebo competes in the learning management system market. There are many other competitors that offer a similar product but may focus on different customers or strategies. For example, Docebo competes with [Instructure‚Äôs Canvas LMS](https://www.instructure.com/canvas/), [Blackboard‚Äôs LMS](https://www.blackboard.com/teaching-learning/learning-management), and a handful of other companies in the LMS market. Some of these competitors focus on different markets such as education.

**Business Overview**

Docebo‚Äôs goal is to "redefine the way enterprises learn by applying new technologies to the traditional corporate learning management system market.‚Äù In simple words, Docebo provides a learning platform for customers to train employees, partners, and customers. Docebo allows companies to upload their own courses and material specific to their employees, partners, or customers. This platform also allows companies to segment the population by division, title, or other factors to allow access to specific groups within the company. Docebo also operates a content marketplace where companies can buy courses covering broad subjects like digital marketing, leadership, or sales. Although this marketplace is not a major part of their business, it is an interesting aspect that might become larger as time goes on.

Within Docebo‚Äôs platform, there are a number of tools and modules to help companies utilize courses and training to improve. Don‚Äôt let these modules distract you from the main part of the business which is just providing companies with a platform to host courses and other material. The modules are listed below:

* Docebo Learn
* Docebo Discover, Coach¬†& Share
* Docebo Extended Enterprise
* Docebo Virtual Coach
* Docebo Mobile Pages
* Docebo Discover
* Docebo Learning Impact

Docebo focuses on mid-market and enterprise customers. Docebo has a list of solid customers: Thomson Reuters, Pearson, HP, Amazon Web Services, Newcross Healthcare Solutions, Experian, Randstad NV, lastminute.com, L‚ÄôOr√©al, Heineken NV, BRF, BMW AG, and Denny‚Äôs. Having Amazon Web Services as a client is a sign that Docebo is doing good things.

**Total Addressable Market**

Management and other sources believe that this market will be worth \~$29.9bn by 2025. In 2019, the learning management system market was estimated to be \~$9.5bn. If the market will be worth \~$29.9bn by 2025 this will be a market that is growing at a CAGR of \~21%.

Many sources also believe there are additional market expansion opportunities such as analytics, automation, and content creation. This is an attractive feature that gives Docebo room for future upside. From my understanding, customers have to build and upload a course to their learning management system. In the future, learning management systems may help educators create course content and help edit content due to the feedback from the course‚Äôs analytics.

**Competitive Advantages**

From this shallow dive, it looks like Docebo may have a number of possible competitive advantages, yet I‚Äôm not sure how strong these are and how difficult it would be for competitors to replicate this.

1. **Switching Costs**  
Docebo sells to mid-market and enterprise customers. Typically these contracts are for multi-year periods and require negotiating and integration. These customers will become accustomed to their learning management system software. They will be familiar with the layout and where everything is located. Manual processes such as uploading courses and inputting employee information will be tedious to change if companies decide to switch platforms. Switching platforms, moving courses, and inputting employee, customer, and partner information will all be tedious work and the opportunity costs may outweigh any potential savings. Docebo‚Äôs customers that decide to switch may lose important data associated with course content. Switching to a more affordable or downright better competitor might be more attractive but the headache of these switching costs may deter many customers from switching.
2. **Economies of Scale**  
Like many leading companies, Docebo has the potential to be one of the leading companies in this growing industry. If so, it will know what additional offerings to provide for customers. Smaller companies may be priced out of this industry due to the cost of building up the LMS software needed to compete with more established companies like Docebo. Small startups can‚Äôt offer the same number of features or the reliability of Docebo. This competitive advantage can be seen by looking at other enterprise SaaS companies like Salesforce, Workday, ServiceNow, and others. Small companies that try to compete broadly with established enterprise SaaS companies often stand no chance. Larger companies can roll out new product features and crush smaller competitors or simply buy up future competitors.

**Financials**

Docebo has seen tremendous growth over the past few years. Revenue has grown due to an increasing customer base and increasing average contract value. Gross margins have also improved due to operating leverage. Docebo is currently in the phase where it‚Äôs investing through its income statement and likely will not show a profit for a number of years.

**Through September 2020:**

* Total revenue = \~$44mn
* Gross margin = \~82%
* Average contract value = \~$31,900

**2019:**

* Total revenue = \~$41mn
* Gross margin = \~80%
* Average contract value = \~$27,400

**2018:**

* Total revenue = \~$27mn
* Gross margin = \~79%
* Average contract value = \~$21,000

**2017:**

* Total revenue = \~$17mn
* Gross margin = \~75%
* Average contract value = \~$15,500

**2016:**

* Total revenue = \~$10mn
* Gross margin = \~73%
* Average contract value = \~$11,500

These numbers all demonstrate impressive growth and are just the tip of the iceberg for Docebo‚Äôs financial profile. Like many other tech companies, Docebo is looking to broaden its market share and focused on capturing long term value instead of short term profits.

**What‚Äôs Interesting**

What initially attracted me to Docebo was that it was a recent IPO with little to no coverage or big headlines like Airbnb, Uber, DoorDash, and other well-funded VC companies. This company has experienced tremendous growth with revenue growing from $10mn to $41mn in revenue in just three years.

Docebo is a small-cap company that is likely out of reach of larger institutional investors like mutual funds and hedge funds. The CEO is also the founder and likely has skin in the game and wants to make Docebo a success because it‚Äôs his prized possession.

After doing more research, Docebo looks to be an attractive company but I would need to do more research to initiate a position. Selling to large companies is attractive for a number of reasons listed above in the competitive advantage section, but at the same time so is selling to smaller ones. The fact that Docebo has a company like Amazon Web Services as a client is also attractive and further piqued my interest.

Docebo also stands to benefit from remote learning. As companies make the transition to remote offices, more courses and training will be done virtually and these companies will rely on an LMS platform like Docebo. Prior to this research, I had never heard of the learning management system industry but I believe it may be a crucial component of many companies in the future just like CRM was 15 years ago.

Docebo also has the potential to be a ten-bagger. It has a small market cap with attractive growth and has a realistic shot of being a ten-bagger based solely on its current size and growth. More work is needed to flesh out a valid claim to be a ten-bagger, but this is just a shallow dive on interesting companies.

**Future Questions**

* **How big is the corporate learning market?**  
An investment in Docebo comes down to your confidence in the size of the corporate learning market and the learning management system market. The corporate market for LMS software is small when compared to more established markets like customer relationship management (Salesforce), human capital management (Workday), and many others. If the corporate learning market grows to be as big as management says, then this will be an attractive industry. The attractiveness of this investment only grows if Docebo solidifies its position as the leading company in this industry.
* **How crucial is learning management system software inside companies?**  
Learning management system software sounds like fluff but it might be a crucial function for many companies. Employees often need to go through compliance training, onboarding, and other required courses to make sure that they are being held to industry regulation or other company-specific rules. This training runs through an LMS platform like Docebo. All employees need to be onboarded and often also go through annual courses. Other crucial content could be how to operate different company-specific software like a Salesforce training course or other tools.

**Conclusion**

Docebo is a good company from this initial review. I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôd initiate a position based solely on this qualitative information, but I‚Äôll be doing more research into the size of the corporate learning market and the differences between Docebo and it‚Äôs competitors.

If Docebo can be placed into the same ‚ÄúEnterprise SaaS‚Äù bucket due to LMS software being a necessity in many companies and if Docebo is the leading company in this growing industry, then it stands a chance to benefit greatly.

**Fun Fact**

Docebo = ‚ÄúI will teach‚Äù in Latin._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Ryan Cohen fucks a stripper (gone sexual) (üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ) It was Monday morning on the 28th of December. Ryan had just woken up in his bed when he realized he had the taste of raw fish in his mouth. He tried to figure out where the fuck in his apartment there was raw fish and that‚Äôs when he heard a snore. He looked to his left when he to his surprise saw a woman. ‚ÄúOh dear, **what have I done!?**‚Äù Exclaimed Ryan loudly in disbelief.

&#x200B;

**The day before:**

The three musketeers Ryan, Elon and Jack dumbfuck Ma had all planned to go to the new bar WSB to try and get laid before the new year. Jack had unfortunately been convicted for stealing Winnie the Pooh plushies and burning them on his roof. Needless to say, it was only Ryan and Elon that showed up. ‚ÄúElon, it‚Äôs time.‚Äù Ryan opened the doors and instantly try were blinded by extreme RGB lighting. The so called bar looked more like a casino the more the two gentlemen looked around. And that was when they saw her. On the grandest of poles right in the center of roulette hall was the finest stripper Ryan and Elon had ever seen. The boys looked at each other and simultaneously started rushing towards the golden pole.

When Ryan had made it to the pole, the woman he had gazed at had started dressing and seemed ready to walk out. ‚ÄúMiss?‚Äù Ryan asked, who had made it first to her since Elon had stopped on the way to talk to some nerd about how he was planning on selling the moon. ‚ÄúAnd you are?‚Äù she asked, followed by a smile that triggered a huge blush on Ryan‚Äôs cheeks. It was at this moment that he knew what he had to do, he had to fuck her. ‚Äú My name is Ryan Cohen and I would be honored if I could bed you tonight miss?‚Äù. ‚ÄúNames Palantir. My shift just ended I have a room upstairs follow me‚Äù She took his hand and started leading him towards the edge of the hall. Thoughts were rushing through Ryan‚Äôs head like a rocket ship headed for the moon. He couldn‚Äôt understand how he had pulled this off. On the outside, she looked like the finest bitch he had ever seen.

&#x200B;

**Fast forward to the morning after:**

Ryan woke up with his heart beating aggressively and sweat dripping like something terrible had just happened. He instantly ripped his iPhone 20X from his golden nightstand and pressed the familiar Robin Hood app. Fuck, fuck! he mumbled until the numbers loaded: GME shares were up 15% in pre-market. A sigh of relief went out, he sat there alone in his bed wondering what an absolute retard you would have to be to buy fuckin Palantir calls just to get an own on Warren maddafuckin Buffet who can die literally any day for being a fat fucking boomer!!!

ARKK _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ NIO will miss 4Q delivery guidance It pains me to write this as I am a NIO bull and believe this company will EXPLODE over the coming year(s), but it is almost guaranteed they will miss 4Q delivery guidance.  See below why.

4Q guidance: 16,500 - 17,000

Oct: 5,055

Nov: 5,291

Dec (To be released Jan 2 or 4): Need 6,154 for low-end of guide, 6,654 for high-end of guide.

Background:

Automotive chip shortage in China: 
A shortage of chips used in auto manufacturing could disrupt automotive production in China well into next year (Dec 4th)
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chinas-car-production-may-face-115148982.html

Nio has been affected by aformentioned chip shortage - their December production is bottlenecked at ~5,000.  Yes you read that right.  This was mentioned by the president of Nio at the annual communications meeting last week.  See below links.

Finally, and more speculative versus the more tangible proof listed above:
Why did Nio (and other EVs for that matter) do the share offering before they released deliveries and even before Nio Day for Nio?  Why would they not wait a few weeks if deliveries would be great and grad a much higher offer price and XXXbillions more?

Seems suspect.

Let me be clear, this is a temporary bottleneck for Dec deliveries and I truly believe Nio is destined to be a massive player in the EV market.  They have all the boxes checked and I am massively bullish.  However, we can't ignore that is going on at the industry level with chip shortages and literally what management mentioned at thier annual communication meeting just a few days ago.  

They said bottlenecked at 5k.  Even if they hit 5.5-6k, that is a massive delivery miss - they will be BELOW the low end of guidance.

Positions 43.5p 1/8/21

I plan on going all in long shortly after - assuming all goes as planned.

The US market is expected to rally, but expect larger gains on the renewables market for the next few days.

The 2021 US budget, which includes the $900 billion COVID stimulus bill, also includes sweeping measures on combating climate change and push for renewable energy:

**$35 billion on renewable energy research and development**

This includes solar (*TAN*) and wind R&D (*FAN*), upgrading the Energy department sustainable transport initiative (*XL sounds interesting*), developing decentralized smart energy grids (*GRID*), and high-risk R&D.

**Tax credit extensions on renewable energy projects**

Solar projects get a two-year extension on tax credits, while onshore wind projects get an extra year. Offshore wind projects finally get its own tax credit, while carbon capture and waste-to-energy credits are extended as well.

Fuel cell vehicles get an extension (*PLUG, FCEL*), as well as electric motorcycles. Non-hydrogen fuel refueling installations also get an extension.

Energy-efficient home installations retain its tax credit. Energy projects in commercial buildings are now given permanent tax credit (*HASI is a close fit*).

**Other provisions**

Hydro-chlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) are to be phased out in 15 years. Low-income families get additional subsidies to install renewable energy in their homes. Excise taxes on coal and oil are extended.

&#x200B;

**Caveats and future events that could make or break the rally**

The Georgia senate runoff elections will dictate the control of the executive and legislative branches. A Republican win can stall the meteoric rise of renewables but it is still expected to gain significantly for 2021. Expect IV in renewables to be high for at least a week after the election, as the decision may not be finalized immediately.

**Recommendations**

It's never too late to hop on the renewables train. üöÄ

Here's why. H&R Block is a pure-play tax prep company specializing in doing taxes for you or an online tax prep software. If you did a bunch of trading in 2020, you need special tax help, because online tax prep software doesn't handle important rules like wash sales or capital loss carryover. Miss a wash sale here or there and expect Mr. John IRS to give you a knock on the door for a special consulation ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)

HRB also has a small market cap of 2.8B and a low P/E of 15.2. Management is seeing a massive rebound from COVID lows and continues to pay the 7% dividend and also bought back $150 million in shares last quarter. \[All wall street analysts give it a price target of $21\]([https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/hrb/analyst-research](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/hrb/analyst-research)).

97% of HRB shares are also owned by institutions.

So you might think $INTU is a good play, and you're not wrong, but the biggest üöÄüöÄüöÄ potential is $HRB. $INTU is overbought and focused on self-service tax prep for normies while $HRB is a better tax prep company for traders and is also undervalued.

Buy low and sell high. Position yourself for the 2021 tax season with üöÄüöÄüöÄ $HRB üöÄüöÄüöÄ_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Quick Stock Market News for Today | SP500 / NASDAQ / DOW JONES / ALIBABA [BABA] | [12-28] **Do you want to know what happened in the stock market on Thursday? Let‚Äôs talk quickly about that and what were the latest news over the weekend**

**\~Long Post\~**

Hello everyone and Good Morning! I‚Äôll try to keep this as short as possible this time so that everyone can enjoy the holiday period as much as possible. So, let‚Äôs start with the recap of Thursday, as we saw all 3 big indexes closing in the green with the [SP500](https://ibb.co/25nr29H) leading the way up .35%, but still lost ground for the week, down .14%, the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/zRsdNyJ) gaining .26% and finishing .38% up for the week and the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/dr0WyrS) rising by .23% to close the short week of trading with a small gain of .1%.

We also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/pbKmzP9) dropping by more than 7% again to bring the volatility index down to the previous levels before the 30% [spike](https://ibb.co/hMjhQhH) we saw on Monday, as it has [dropped](https://ibb.co/kgPCkvn) almost 7 points after that spike.

We had a pretty much even market with just over 100 new highs as most [companies](https://ibb.co/SJCrVzX) traded below average volume on the short day, with 10 of the 11 [sectors](https://ibb.co/YbSSMt3) of the SP closing in the green, with Real Estate, Utilities & Technology leading the way while the Energy sector was the only one which lost ground Thursday, as Large-Cap growth companies were the [biggest](https://ibb.co/hYTsTLG) gainers, with small-caps finally underperforming after a great run in the past weeks.

Here is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/8MKCB9h) from Thursday, with most big tech Names gaining slightly, except Alibaba which plunged after China started the probe into the monopolistic practices of the company, while for the [week](https://ibb.co/f2NzK9d) we can see a pretty mixed stock market with big gains being made in the tech sector mostly, while big healthcare names, utilities and most of the Energy companies lost ground this week.

We also got a couple of economic numbers in the past few days, as holiday retail [sales](https://ibb.co/bB4XtGm) are estimated to be up 3% with online sales up almost 50% between the 11th of October and the 24th of December as e-commerce accounted for almost 20% of overall retail sales, up more than 6% since last year with big winners like Amazon, Wayfair an Etsy as well as big gains in the home improvement and home furniture sectors.

The other big number we received is more worrying, as investors have made a new high in margin debt, with over $700B in [margin](https://ibb.co/qYxdPtw) through November, I personally don‚Äôt use margin even when buying leveraged products to avoid too much volatility in my portfolio.

And one last report that we got from Reuters, is that they expect [China](https://ibb.co/LtKVg0T) to overtake the US and become the biggest economy by the end of the decade.

We only have a fed survey coming in [today](https://ibb.co/170H4tD), and this [week](https://ibb.co/Gsjqvf8) will be most of the same, with only some sprinkled numbers in the middle of the week, and not anything interesting to be reported as earnings go, before a closed day on New Year‚Äôs Day.

And in some other stock market news, we saw Alibaba increasing the stock [buyback](https://ibb.co/SXgfNW8) plan to $10B but this wasn‚Äôt enough to stop the bleeding for the company as this news came alongside the demands made by the regulators for [Ant](https://ibb.co/55zL5VK) Group to fix problems in some segments of their business before they can move on with the company going public.

Let‚Äôs hope for a good day in the market as the [FUTURES US](https://ibb.co/1XWqjyW) / [FUTURES INTL](https://ibb.co/D5TJ4Cs) seem to be pointing at a good open, with all 3 big indexes in the green as the Nasdaq is leading the way, after President Trump finally signed the [stimulus](https://ibb.co/55v9p8L) deal last night, finally ending this long messy situation.

**Microbiology PHD estimates there have already been 100k reinfections**

>In actuality, there are most likely around 50,000-100,000 reinfections in the world, excluding asymptomatic first or second infections which may not have been caught on either screening.[[0]](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/kj6f2s/observational_study_on_healthcare_workers/ggv298c/)

Reinfections are common given the opportunity [[1]](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/khsw6u/scientists_urge_concern_not_alarm_over_new_virus/ggo8qir/). Reinfections can be used to estimate anti-body half life for anti-bodies created by the vaccine. [[2]](https://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/antibody+half-life). Reinfections can also be used as an indicator for B cell immunity, as B cell immunity created via an infection is the same as B cell immunity created by a vaccine. [[3]](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/mrna.html). **Reinfections indicate anti-body half life is short and B cell immunity is weak**. This implies booster shots are needed but bi-annual vaccine boosters are not logistically feasible.

Antigenic drift can reduce efficacy rapidly. Its not possible to vaccinate for multiple versions bi-annually. [[4]](https://twitter.com/trvrb/status/1340409968818671616?s=20). "Immune Evasion" can already be seen occuring in the South African strain [[5]](https://sciencespeaksblog.org/2020/12/22/covid-19-south-african-variant-may-be-worse-than-uk-variant/). Suspiciously, there are also 1594 untested and suspected cases in fda report for pfizer vaccine, in vaccinated group. [[6]](https://www.fda.gov/media/144245/download). 

**The Moderna Vaccine‚Äôs Antibodies May Not Last As Long As We Hoped**

>A significant determinant of vaccines‚Äô effectiveness in controlling a pandemic is antibody duration‚Äîhow long the antibodies last in a person‚Äôs system. [[7]](https://www.forbes.com/sites/williamhaseltine/2020/12/22/the-moderna-vaccines-antibodies-may-not-last-as-long-as-we-hoped/)

**A Prospective Study on Rapidly Declining SARS‚ÄêCoV‚Äê2 IgG Antibodies Within One to Three Months of Testing IgG Positive**

>**Conclusions**
>Our findings show that the protective COVID-19 IgG antibodies rapidly decline over one to three months. Rapidly decaying protective IgG antibodies would impact herd immunity and vaccine durability. It is critical for the potential vaccines to generate both protective T- and B-cell immune responses in a sustained manner. [[8]](https://www.cureus.com/articles/46453-a-prospective-study-on-rapidly-declining-sarscov2-igg-antibodies-within-one-to-three-months-of-testing-igg-positive-can-it-lead-to-potential-reinfections)

**Anti-body half life can be determined from the following equation.** [[10]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life)

>Nt = No √ó (0.5)  ^ (t / thalf)

>10 = 100 √ó (0.5) ^ (90 / thalf)

>0.10 = (0.5) ^ (90 / thalf)

>ln(0.10) = ln(0.5) √ó (90 / thalf)

> thalf = (90 √ó ln(0.5)) / ln(0.10)

> thalf = 27 days

A vaccine would provide up to 4 times the initial anti-body count as a natural infection. 

**Re-run the equation to find how long it would take for anti-bodies, provided by a vaccine, to drop below the critical threshold.**

>10 = 400 √ó (0.5) ^ (t / 27)

> ln(0.025) = ln(0.5) √ó (t / 27)

> t = (27 √ó ln(0.025)) / ln(0.5)

> t = 143 days

Stonks fall fast. Spy 315p 6/9/21 (Fauci's expected booster date)

**TL;DR**: Anti-body half life is short. B cells immunity is weak due as indicated by reinfections (100k estimated). Vaccine boosters needed ~143 days after second dose (+10 to 12 days to reach max anti-body count), or bi-annually.

>Bonus Points: The 100k reinfection estimate sourced from a PHD in Microbiology / Immonology AND is also in charge of ordering bootser shots [[9]](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/kj6f2s/observational_study_on_healthcare_workers/ggv4kmm/)

You've probably heard of Unity and the reputation of Unity games. But did you know that Unity commands 70% of the top 100 app store games? Almost half of all mobile games now are made using Unity.

Okay so big deal I hear you say, they're big. But everyone knows their reputation, all shit games, right? Wrong! Not only do they dominate the mobile market but even AAA studios love Unity.

A few small names powered by Unity:

* Hearthstone
* Pok√©mon GO
* Rust
* Wasteland 2
* 7 Days to Die
* Kerbal Space Program
* RISK: Global Domination
* Firewatch
* Escape from Tarkov
* GTFO

Or any other number of massively successful titles & AAA studios which use this fantastic engine:[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_Unity\_games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Unity_games)

**Growth Potential:**  
Unity has always been vocal, not only about expanding what they're doing in the game industry but with software far outside of just video games. Aquarium touch screens? Unity. Business deep-learning prediction software? Unity. Virtual museum? Unity.

But what makes their plans for the future more special is their new scriptable render pipeline. Originally Unity was meant to be an out-of-the-box "One size fits all" model so that as many different games could be made with it as possible. With the introduction of the scriptable render pipeline they've now introduced URP and HDRP. So what does that mean?

Knowing all the ins-and-outs of Unity was what was originally required for making a game look good. You had to know about the package manager, about how to make good post processing, etc. Now with HDRP & URP you get a premade choice. URP if you're going for mobile or performance. HDRP if you're going for AAA quality. Unreal Engine's starting to look dated by comparison!

**Why has there never been anything like it?**  
Companies prior to around 2012 always had to write their own engines from the ground up usually in hard-to-program frameworks and in intensive languages like C++. Now games have become so complex that companies are opting to license out to software like Unity or Unreal Engine.

What makes Unity special though is that this is the first time that a third party game engine has gone public. Literally history in the making. Millions of game developers and investors across the world immediately began pouring money into the stock and its increased in value over 100%. The stock opened September 18th @ $75 and is already valued at $166. And as the first publicly traded engine this also means they now have access to a massive cash pool with they can use to innovate, and expand in a way their competitors just can't keep up with!

With the massive growth of companies in and outside of game development switching to Unity the company is seeing unprecedented levels of growth. And with their introduction of the scriptable render pipeline & HDRP they now even threaten their main rival Unreal Engine's advantage which was primarily in graphics. Not to mention the large asset store, a mini free market where developers can put up their own paid game assets which Unity taxes every sale of. Models, Scripts, Audio, you name it. And with it being all virtual there's little overhead.

What's more is that similar to Windows or Apple, Unity inspires loyalty among its users who believe in it. This immediately meant that software engineers, game designers, and more began investing in it. And the better it does, the more those who waited jump on board.

This concludes my wsb talk.

Let's fucking go tomorrowüöÄüåö _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Bulls VS Bears _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ The 'Tutes' vs PLTR compared to SNOW and AI... and why PLTR is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for retail investors (until now... ) It should surprise no one that Institutional Investors and Hedge Funds love the traditional IPO process: a company wants to raise money and provide liquidity for their stock, so they engage the entrenched financial industry in a process of listing shares on a public exchange to raise capital to fund growth.

The underwriters organize a horse show to hype the stock to the Tutes, whonunderstand that a similar barrage of media hype will be produced to stoke the fires of retail demand. The company gets funded, often above their initially defined goals, and the Tutes get in at a price that leaves plenty of room for a 'pop' on the debut of the stock's trading: when retail investors hungry for the opportunity to own the stock pay market value at whatever price shares start trading, the Tutes make instant profits.

SNOW and AI both conformed to the industry paradigm, performed traditional IPOs, and despite being egregiously overvalued,  have continued to rise from even their debut prices to push the limits of valuation to absurd levels (I'm not talking about IPO prices, but the prices at which they started trading).

I have no problem with the 'forward looking growth'' theory behind the valuation of these stocks, but the more I research and understand the business models behind SNOW, Ai, and PLTR, the more I feel the IPO industry is simply punishing PLTR for doing a direct listing rather than performing an IPO that would have given the Tutes their presumably entitled benefits.

Let's pause for moment to explain this to anyone who doesn't understand the traditional IPO process vs direct listings.

SNOW and AI both entered public trading on the stock market through the traditional IPO process. Both companies are burning through cash faster than they are earning it, and opted to raise their next round of financing by engaging with a group of underwriters (Goldman, Merril, etc) to create a bunch of new shares and sell them - generally these shares are sold to institutional investors: hedge funds, pension funds, high net worth individuals,  and other 'smart money' pools of significant capital. Retail investors (you and me) are left out. 

For weeks, the company, with the guidance (connections provided by) their underwriters, pitch their company to these Tutes, and the Tutes have decades long relationships with these underwriters upon which they understand that this process is designed to ensure their mutual profit.  There is an entire indistry built around launching these IPOs to ensure that the Tutes make an instant profit by allowing them to purchase shares at a price that meets the debuting company's financial goals, while a parallel media mechanism is deployed that hypes and justifies relatively absurd valuations to retail investors. The end result being a process where Tutes are able to buy a stock at an IPO price that is significantly less than the price at which retail investors can buy it later in the day.

SNOW IPO price: $120.
SNOW debut trading price: $245

AI IPO price: $42
AI debut trading price: $101

Ok, crazy, right?
But here's the thing, the 'analysts' and major publications that influence retail investment behaviour all supported these valuations as though they were justified by future growth expectations! All they talked about was the importance of data analytics and artificial intelligence. No hesitation, no doubt, no talk about risk or downside, just pure unadulterated pump and hype.

Funny thing is, SNOW and AI seem to be as closely aligned in terms of business model to PLTR as any other products/services I have researched. All 3 provide software services that allow large organizations to more effectively aggregate, visualize, and apply AI to large data sets for the ultimate purpose of making critical business decisions. 

But here's the thing... when PLTR decided to float their stock on the public exchange via a direct listing, rather than through a typical IPO process, the Tutes got left out... and they were clearly pissed.

The number of disinformation articles I read that tried to paint Palantir as just a consultancy, with too much exposure to a particular political party or government contracts in general, or lack of profitability (despite being cash flow positive), was a clear relflection of the industry's attempt to punish and apply downward pressure on the PLTR share price.

Funny thing is, we now know that many hedge funds have been loading up on PLTR while their media counterparts were depressing the share price. I expect we'll learn that more have been doing the same since then, and I suspect that many have been hoping to keep the share price as low as possible until the lockup period expires sometime in Feb/March.

It's pretty ridiculous when an analyst like Barron's downgrades the stock rating while simultaneously increasing their price target from just a month previous by nearly 50%.

It seems that almost everyday I read an article that chastises the retail investment market for pumping PLTR to a share price that equates to a 50x revenue multiple, yet they are ok with SNOW trading at a revenue multiple of over 175x, AI trading at over 90x. Meanwhile SNOW and AI generated revenue in the $250M ballpark in the last year, while PLTR posted over $1B.

PLTR direct listed their shares on Sept 30, 2020 at $10/share, and unlike SNOW and AI, did not feel the need to raise amy funds in the process. You would think that indicated financial strength for a company.

Had PLTR gone public via a traditional IPO and followed the trend of every other tech related stock to IPO this year, the IPO price may have started at $10 and inflated to an IPO price in the $20-30 range before debuting for retail trading in the $50-60 range.

With the IPO industry's promotional hype and backing, the stock likely goes up from there, or at least holds and pops on every new government contract headline.

Instead, the Tutes played a game of disinformation - holding the price down below $10 for the first month of trading while quietly building their positions. But then the silent period expired, earnings were released, the cat got out of the bag, and even Shitron Tweets could only temporarily subdue the rally.

It seems like the only headwind in site is the lockup period. And with plenty of involvement with Covid vaccine rollout, seemingly weekly new government contracts, upcoming promotional events, and a lilely stellar ER, there's no reason not to expect PLTR to soon join the lofty valuations of SNOW and AI in the upcoming months.

+++

... and here's why this opportunity to buy in alongside, instead of after, the Tutes take their positions.

This past week, the NYSE approved the decision to allow companies to do a direct listing WHILE raising additional capital for their company in the process (PLTR did a direct listing without raising additional funds).
The incentive for companies to pursue the traditional IPO process, which has proven to leave substantial funds on the table, while primarily benefitting the underwriters and their clients (the Tutes), may be significantly disrupted. 

And similarly to the way in which SPACs have provided more parity for retail investors to buy into stocks before Tutes have taken their pound of flesh, the next round of direct listings should provide previously unavailable opportunities for retail investors to take positions in newly traded companies at levels alongside, rather than underneath, those of institutional investors. 

Am praying that Roblox and a few other upcoming debuts decide to follow this path as well.

With all the DDs and internal information that is already out there on WSB about GME, I figured that I'd save you from hearing about the nonsense that everyone else has pretty much already said...

Instead, I decided to do my own Technical Analysis on GME:

The chart below is the full history of the GME stock, you can clearly see that there is a lot of resistance around the $21-23 range *(I know its hard to tell because its messy but just try to follow along as best as you can*). 

When we look at 2006, once it made a clear break of this $21-23 range, it shot up to $63.77. Especially in 2008-2012, there was a lot of consolidation around these price ranges but eventually did squeeze up to 57.70. Just to prove my point a bit deeper about this zone, around 2015-2016 prices finally came back down to the 21-23 range and guess what it did...**IT CONSOLIDATED IN THE $21-23 ZONE!** Once it broke that support, it took a pretty steep fall so in short... this 21-23 zone is a very strong zone to keep an eye out for.

Here is a 5d-15m chart of GME. On here you will see lots of lines and shit. These lines and shit have some meaning to it so just bear with me alright! If you already couldn't tell, these are my support and resistance zones. **The most important zone on here is going to be the purple zone which is $21.33-21.52** , which is also going to be my entry point if GME can make a clear break of that zone. Best way to put it, if it can clear $21.33, wE iS tO Da mOoN bABy üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ

BUT HOLD YOUR FREAKING HORSES! if we fall below 20.02...we might be in for quite a steep drop as this $20 zone has been acting as a strong support level for the past week. If it makes a clean break of support, we'll probably fall back to $18.75...if it can't hold that? 15.80 again and we'll have to start this awful process all over again. I am extremely bullish on GME so I am not too worried that GME is going to fall under $20, but it is always good to have a back up plan, ya neva kno:/

&#x200B;

To wrap this long and boring TA up. I am not entering until GME can clear $21.33, if it breaks this zone with a lot of volume... mark my words fellow autists, **WE WILL SQUEEZE UP TO 32.80 BABY**  üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ *(refer to red zone on first chart to see why 32.80 is my first price target)*

**TLDR:**

$22c 1/15/21

$25c 1/29/21

$30c 2/19/21



UPDATE: I am making this edit for anyone who may be concerned about GME today, I am still very much confident that GME will burst this week and as for now I am still keeping my eye out for the 21.33 zone. As we know, it broke that resistance earlier and ran up a lot but the volume was just way too low and it wasn‚Äôt able hold. Long story short, I will be going in heavy if we can break the 21.33 zone with substantial volume.

EDIT: BEARS IN TEARS TONIGHT

# _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ The Ultimate Parlay: DraftKings ($DKNG) Here on a Sunday night to give you autists some time to cross-check my info, start your RH instant deposit, and let your wife's bf know you're coming back with a vengeance. Here's an in-depth analysis on DraftKings and how to maximize profits over the foreseeable future to squeeze this for every tendie we can. Now that many states face revenue shortfalls due to the coronavirus pandemic and wider budget deficits, there needs to be a push to fill that gap and nothing is better positioned than sports betting.

As you all know, $DKNG came to market through a SPAC merging with Diamond Eagle back in April, at the worst of the pandemic when live sports were dead and there was more uncertainty than ever for what was to come. Jason Robins, Draft Kings CEO, has balls of steel and knew that they needed to get to market quickly for a sports betting run-up the likes of which we've never seen. Sports are now on their way back, with a huge amount of positive catalysts coming up in the next few months to skyrocket this stock to the moon and beyond.

# Management

I want to clarify that a large amount of my conviction from this play comes from the incredible management team leading the company. CEO Jason Robins is a stand-up guy and has led the company through a huge amount of scrutiny since its founding in 2012. He comes from a data analytics background which could not be a better fit for the sports betting business. He prioritizes the high speed data that fuels the DraftKings platform as its most valuable asset and speaks often on the commitment his team has to ethical values and encouraging a trustworthy environment for its users to gamble their paychecks on the DraftKings platform.

I've linked a great interview to get to know the CEO and give further insight into DraftKing's plans moving forward below and highly recommend anyone going in on this play give it a quick watch. Jason is optimistic about the future of state's legalizing mobile sports betting moving forward and says they will continue to invest boatloads of money into customer acquisition costs through TV ads and billboards on a state-by-state basis. Link: [https://youtu.be/2OVFB9piEC0](https://youtu.be/2OVFB9piEC0)

Any of you who have come across DraftKings commercials, YouTube ads, billboards, know that their marketing is on point. This is a great play because DraftKing's expansion has occurred thus far on a state-by-state basis. This means that there's a large part of the nation (actually the majority) that is still ignorant to the sports betting wave that is coming in 2021. DraftKings is positioned extremely well to lead the way into the \~25 states still waiting to pass the bill.

# Legislation

The fact that the top 4 states in the country still have not legalized online sports betting presents a HUGE opportunity to ride this wave with little downside risk. Sports have already gone through the worst-case scenario during COVID shutdowns and survived‚Äînow we‚Äôve got a great amount of positive catalysts coming up (NBA season, March madness, Super Bowl, etc.) that the general population is begging for some action on, paired with more money in their pocket from significantly less entertainment costs since the pandemic started.

The Wuhan Virus gave DraftKings a shot in the arm to streamline its way into most (if not all) of the remaining state's ballots during Q1 and Q2 due to the huge cut in tax revenues that the lockdowns caused across the country. Governor Cuomo of New York released a statement last week stating he is now considering the passing of mobile sports betting in order to raise the state's tax revenue during a time where Congress completely skipped them over in terms of providing aid through the stimmy. New York is a huge catalyst moving forward. In my opinion, this is a make or break for how things look for DraftKings moving forward, and will largely influence how other states react. Mobile sports betting scares states as it is new and so accessible, but if you do research into the Powerball and other loterry companies, it just took a push in the right direction for states to realize how much money they are leaving on the table by not participating in these emerging markets. Sports betting has already benefited the 9 states which passed the bill (NJ leading the way) and has NY as well as every other governor, feeling major FOMO.

Current states where online (mobile) sports betting laws have passed:

* New Jersey
* West Virginia
* Indiana
* Pennsylvania
* New Hampshire
* Iowa
* Colorado
* Illinois
* Tennessee

Some of the reported revenues from sports betting:

**New Jersey:** $931.6 million

**Pennsylvania:** $491.9 million

**Illinois:** $434 million

**Indiana:** $250.8 million

**Colorado:** $231.2 million

&#x200B;

[On May 14, 2018, the United States Supreme Court found the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act \(PASPA\), the federal law prohibiting states from authorizing sports betting, to be unconstitutional. It is now up to individual states to decide if they want to authorize and regulate sports betting in their state. Congress can also take action on the authorization and regulation of sports betting but has so far left it up to individual states.](https://preview.redd.it/dxnojqu80u761.png?width=2060&format=png&auto=webp&s=bc94391759232c4e1337d8af2b2cf1cfcb090141)

As you can see, states are cashing out on the mobile sports betting wave, with New Jersey leading the way and making a large part of that revenue from NY residents crossing state lines to get their gambling fix in. Gov. Cuomo has been opposed to legalizing sports betting in the past, calling it "a violation of the constitution"...buut that was before covid lockdowns and his state was drowning up to their neck in debt.

DraftKings management issued extremely bullish guidance without even taking into account new states passing legislation. This is one of the things that I love about CEO Jason Robins that stood out to me in the hours of interviews/articles I‚Äôve looked over. This man is the pinnacle of **underpromising and over delivering**. The staff at Draft Kings are extremely customer centric and focused on strong ethics to help them provide a platform for sports aficionados to enhance their viewing experience.¬†

# Data-Driven/Proprietary Tech Stack (the MOAT)

Legislation aside, the other huge catalyst is DraftKing's unique approach to owning its own data and proprietary tech stack. I believe that this will be where DKNG separates itself from the competition that is rushing to this space and will give it the upper hand in acquiring, and retaining, a large percentage of new users across opening states.

**From investor presentation:** *"Upon close of the business combination, DraftKings will become the only vertically-integrated pure-play sports betting and online gaming company based in the United States. Through the business combination, DraftKings expects to realize synergies by transitioning its risk and trading sports betting platform to SBTech‚Äôs, instead of relying on a third-party platform. In addition to reducing costs, DraftKings will control its backend system and product roadmap, differentiating the company from other U.S. operators and giving it the ability to tailor its sports betting product to U.S. sports and users."*

*"SBTech is a global leader in omni-channel sports betting and gaming, with more than 1,200 employees in 10 offices worldwide. Since 2007, the group has developed the industry‚Äôs most powerful online sports betting and casino platform, serving licensees in more than 15 regulated territories. SBTech‚Äôs clients include many of the world‚Äôs premier betting and gaming operators, state lotteries, land-based casinos, horse racing companies, and iGaming start-ups. The group supplies highly flexible betting and gaming solutions to clients looking for exceptional configurability and the quickest route to market, complemented by proven business intelligence and reporting capabilities. The SBTech offering includes its seamless sportsbook, Chameleon360 iGaming platform, managed services, on-property sportsbook and omni-channel solutions that provide players with constant access to sports and casino products across all online, mobile and retail channels. Supported by unrivaled expertise in trading and risk management, acquisition and CRM, and the highest standards of regulatory compliance, SBTech‚Äôs partners consistently achieve rapid growth, enhanced brand loyalty and record revenues."*

DraftKings prioritized **OWNING** their own backend technology via this merger with SBTech, making them the first, and only company in this space to own their risk and trading platform. This gives DraftKings a *huge* edge to the rest of the market. It forked up the cash to keep everything in house not only to provide a better customer experience, but also to widen the moat against competitors as new states come onboard. The key here is to clarify that DraftKings and SBTech combined to be the only player in the market with 100% vertical integration and control of their own backend. Jason Robins and the rest of the management team are placing their efforts on having the best technology and the best product and really going all in on owning the U.S. landscape opening up, with as little need for cross-platform interaction as possible.

This acquisition of SBTech was a complete game changer because it allowed them to be independent from paying revenue share to a third-party for betting lines and risk management services.

**Clarification: no other sports betting/fantasy sports/casino company currently has 100% vertical integration on the level that DraftKings has established.**

# iGaming Boom

This is where the market is missing the mark. Take the time to read over analyst reports, news articles, and interviews and you'll quickly notice 99% of the general market is completely glazing over DraftKing's iGaming sector. This industry has been a CA$H COW in Europe for awhile now, and is only getting started in the United States. Out of the companies that occupy this space, DraftKings is the only one to create one synergistic platform for Fantasy sports/Sportsbook/iGaming. This will be a huge value proposition that will ultimately rocket DraftKings to the top of the gaming market and solidify it as THE gaming powerhouse moving forward.

&#x200B;

[The infrastructure driving DraftKing's products and Tech \(all in one platform\)](https://preview.redd.it/t7x2af1k0u761.png?width=2156&format=png&auto=webp&s=8630f1eb26f047e004675572a4288b8eb183f9e2)

Anyone that's watched the run of Skillz and the hype pushing PaySafe, knows how much anticipation there is for iGaming to become the new norm in the world of gambling. DraftKings has emerged as the market leader in each state they've launched in, and continue to gain more and more market share. Once new users get introduced to their platform, the cross-selling opportunity is limitless and creates an extremely sticky customer acquisition cycle.

Competitors like Penn and MGM are dinosaurs in this space and have been playing catch-up to DraftKings since 2012. The new age of gamblers don't want to drive to a physical casino location or buy a home desktop to gamble. Everything will be mobile and run in real-time. DraftKings has been building an incredible live-sports ecosystem (first to market) and innovates the possibilities of what you can bet on a daily basis. Just download the app for yourself and do some exploring. I believe this is going to boom in the TikTok/millennial crowd as more states start to hop onboard.

# 2021 Projections

Pulled from the investor presentation, $DKNG has smashed every one of their 2020 assumptions listed below. For any stats guys out there, I would love to see some models at how much of this market is still up for grabs. DraftKings has positioned themselves to be at the head of this movement, and I believe that 2021 will be the year we really see them take off into triple digits share prices.

The catalysts are there, and the market is ripe for the taking. Their projections are extremely conservative and management lets the numbers do the talking. In my opinion, this is a bet on the management putting the dots together to EXECUTE as state legislation starts to go their way, once NY happens this shift will occur *rapidly.*

&#x200B;

[https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/1772757\/000110465920032214\/tm2012476d1\_425.htm](https://preview.redd.it/fci6corp0u761.png?width=2302&format=png&auto=webp&s=8a44dc5ecd56485439611c32db456b72d0664c49)

The management is incredible and truly displays a vision for wanting to prop up shareholder value in the long-term through valuable data, a fully integrated platform, and aggressive customer acquisition to take control of this market as states realize the economic deficits which they are facing going into a new year. This along with the unprecedented hype that is going to be involved with sports events this year, will skyrocket DraftKings to new heights.

This is not a bet on sports betting alone, it is a play on a data-heavy and analytically driven behemoth, with strategic partnerships (league, team, and celebrity partnerships) and one of the most aggressive marketing strategies I have ever laid eyes on. The stock soared earlier this years upon news of the Michael Jordan partnership ([https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/02/investing/draftkings-michael-jordan-deal/index.html](https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/02/investing/draftkings-michael-jordan-deal/index.html)) and there is many, many more big moves in the pipeline.

# Conclusion

Long-term I am extremely bullish on people wanting risk to make up a daily part of their lives. The psychology of sports betting resembles that of the lottery and is becoming a must-have for people to have the choice to place bets from the convenience of their mobile phones. We are moving into a future where if risk and leverage are not involved, people will have little interest in dedicating their time to things. This shift can be seen with the boom in retail options trading (shoutout wsb gang) and will have a similar effect in sports, iGaming, and random prop bets/surveys that Draft Kings is innovating heavily in. This is not to mention the infrastructure that DKNG is continuing to build out to rival that of Europe in terms of live sports betting (which makes up three quarters of revenue for online sports books in the UK) and expanding their horizons to lesser betted on sports such as tennis, golf, soccer, etc.

If you've gotten this far, congrats you're just a few steps away from striking gold. Any feedback, comments, rebuttals, bear scenarios, etc. please comment. Good luck.

 So Netflix's market cap is 227 billion vs At&t which is 204 billion, Hbo max which is brand new only has 6% the amount of users compared to Netflix so it has a shit load of growth potential. 

Also on an anecdotal note most people I know either have an HBO max account or are talking about getting one.

We also all seen how much Disney has shot up do to Disney Plus (which has 86 million users, but has been out for 13 months compared to HBO max which only been out for 7 months, also it's twice as expensive as disney plus).

**My Pt4 of DD is coming but I just want you guys to be aware of the following going into Monday December 28th.**

It is true that shorts have been bullying us left right and center. They‚Äôve been pushing us around for months. They‚Äôve been manipulating the stock to put downward pressure in every way they can.

I got so fuckin tired of those using money/power to push little guys around, it compelled me to write my very first Reddit post about a move a bully made to push GME down. Shoutout to u/The_Bossss for spotting their next move too.

&#x200B;

**But not every move of theirs sits in plain sight like this.**

* Ones who‚Äôve been keeping an eye on the price action would know this but Oct/Nov: all those ‚Äòsharp 5\~10% rise‚Äô the first market hour followed by gradual decline throughout the day could have been them taking the steam out.

Think about it. After 20 days of you messaging your friends ‚Äúoh shit GME is squeezing today!‚Äù you start to fall into ‚Äúfuck it, I‚Äôm wrong again, GME will never squeeze.‚Äù

* It‚Äôs also VERY possible, that they are amongst us, selling us believable stories like ‚ÄúDecember 24th is going to squeeze because of A, B, and C.‚Äù and feed us believable bullshit to:

A) to create disappointment again/take the steam out of us or

B) to scalp us on options (honestly these posts could also be written by just straight up scumbags amongst us for this purpose). Options that were $0.01 $0.02 a couple days prior as a result were $0.10, $0.15. Doesn‚Äôt seem like much but we‚Äôre talking easy 10 baggers and 7.5 baggers for these scalpers.

C) They genuinely believe it, but you need to be aware of A and B and take it with a grain of salt.

* It is possible that they bought leading up to earnings/ran the price up, only to dump to set the ‚Äòdirection‚Äô and cause a bigger sell-off utilizing the paper handedness of WSB. Yes, missing revenue was missed by 9.73% and that‚Äôs not good, but when their earnings are beaten by 38.5%, did it really warrant almost a 20% slide the next day?

Again, this was likely due to FOMO and disappointment, but I want you to be aware of the possibility.

&#x200B;

Similarly, they may have bought the past week only to cause a dip one of these days.

The moment you paperhand it, is the moment you accept defeat and let the bully have their way once again.

Look around you, you got a whole gang of people on this sub alone that will never let it get so bad. Our big brother Cohen will slap Melvin back to hibernation before you get seriously hurt.

Don‚Äôt turn your back and cry away just because you got bitchslapped. They are laughing at you as you walk to the corner to cry.

(This is where your and my interest conflicts because I just deposited more funds and I‚Äôm hoping for a dip so whatever you do is fine by me.)

**Don‚Äôt be fooled/read Seeking Alpha/Motley Fool articles likely paid off by Melvin Capital to be written that says GME may crash and burn or whatever because, on the contrary:**

* It is true that ICR now has GameStop under ‚ÄúTechnology‚Äù now and it is true that Eli and Peyton Manning are doing a Q&A at 5:30pm, which is just after Gamestop‚Äôs presentation.   
**Important edit:** Mannings were scheduled well before Gamestop's schedule changed from the 13th to 11th. Mannings may not have anything to do with Gamestop. 

Maybe they‚Äôre going to announce a development of light weight/portable/budget friendly Omni directional treadmill? next generation gaming wearable? VR?

‚Äì look up OmniPad for example of light weight ones (these guys are working with Facebook now).I will talk about this in my Pt 4 DD but this is the future of gaming, e-sports even conferences/trade shows and even ZOOM calls (think room-like 'depth' so different conversations don't end up over-running each other). This would be HUGE.

* At the very least, just like how it has us guessing, it‚Äôs enough to make Melvin Capital‚Äôs head start spinning wondering if they should trim their position just in case.

They must have at the very least had an internal conflict/dialogue about their GME short position there by now.

They can start closing any day now. I personally wouldn't try to time this. It can easily mean the difference between 10x baggers and 6x baggers.

* It could also be possible that the ‚Äòbeef‚Äô between Cohen and Sherman is not real.

Look at the wording of the letters, look at the changes that Gamestop has been making over the past few months on their website alone.

For all we know, the 'weaknesses' are shown just to keep the shorts piling. They could be working together. Who knows, Cohen and Sherman? might even share a common background.

* It is true that all shorts are under water currently and they are paying fees/interest on their position (I know this is so obvious/repeated many times, sorry)
* Ryan Cohen bought at $16.00. He‚Äôs not even sweating.

You gotta wonder, how did he come to 12.9%? Is that his max? is that all he‚Äôs got?

As u/ronoron pointed out, Cohen is not even fuckin sweating.He‚Äôs just trying to meme ‚ÄúOVER 9000‚Äù (holding 9,001,000 shares)

* You also have to understand that in the world of high level execs/finance (and even politics), people all somehow know each other/are connected in a way.

There is a criss cross web of connections. As much as they fuck us and swat at us like bugs, up there you can‚Äôt be so rash.

Cohen can‚Äôt just come to the scene and instantly make the squeeze happen. He‚Äôll make enemies that way.

It has to be done in a way where he‚Äôs given so many warnings, given them so many exits along the way and made his intentions so clear all throughout.

Also, he‚Äôs Canadian so he‚Äôll probably even say sorry as he makes the squeeze happen.

Source: I am Canadian and I am sorry for the long DDs.

**Armed with this information:**

You guys are not all delicate snowflakes anymore. You guys are all carbon atoms. Some of you guys who can take some heat will make out as carbon fibre, but those who can take the real heat and real pressure will make out as diamonds.

Remember, the squeeze is a war and the moment the Spartan 300‚Äôs marching shield formation is held, GME can see $300s.

I will get to the boring math stuff one day of how I got to $103 minimum squeeze price and $326 on the upper end. I know my DDs are long, but fuck I know for sure I‚Äôm gonna lose y'all on the math.

Seeing how you guys handled the last round of puts, I think it might even go higher but we shall see.

For those like me who had/have to build everything from $0 and never got any inheritance/financial help, the squeeze can be the greatest transfer of wealth you will ever experience. This time, you'd take from the bully.

**positions**:  Shares as well as options JAN 15 15C, 30C, APR 16 30C. GME makes majority of my port.

Still not too late to board a rocket if you pick the right one. There is a lot of profit-taking going on after recent run-ups, once that is passed there could be another 10-20+% short-term gain. Even more, if something goes full meme.

**Background**

I‚Äôm not even going to start explaining the 2020 Russian hack. If you want to know more: [https://www.vox.com/22187866/usa-cyber-hack-solar-winds-microsoft](https://www.vox.com/22187866/usa-cyber-hack-solar-winds-microsoft)

Great post that actually preceded the FEYE üí• üí• üí• from u/Chalupuhh: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kgdp82/feye\_and\_other\_cyber\_stonks\_on\_the\_rise\_from/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kgdp82/feye_and_other_cyber_stonks_on_the_rise_from/)

Even before the hack, a lot of these tickers were starting to get significant press: [https://investorplace.com/2020/10/7-cybersecurity-stocks-to-buy-for-the-5g-wave/](https://investorplace.com/2020/10/7-cybersecurity-stocks-to-buy-for-the-5g-wave/)

There are a number of players in the cybersecurity space. Some of them (CRWD, NET) have already achieved demi-meme status and/or had huge run-ups before the hack. This overview is just a limited slice. Depending on how things evolve, I may revisit it and add other tickers (feel free to suggest).

&#x200B;

**Fundamentals**

Not even sure why I included this. No one here cares ‚Äì and certainly, 2020 doesn‚Äôt give a damn. If you look at anything, at least digest the P/E and put/call ratios.

[A bunch of shit no one here will look at.](https://preview.redd.it/1wrz49pzet761.png?width=2390&format=png&auto=webp&s=f23f94821dec8fc28f06137c2cfa9648b7e1faa0)

**Charts**

Charts are all 4h (I have limited trading access during the day; therefore, I can only really trade daily momentum). Bollinger bands, MACD, and RSI are below if you‚Äôre into that kind of thing.

There is one over-arching pattern for many of these companies ‚Äì gap up on 12/18, peak on 12/22, sell-off through 12/24. 

I hope you smooth brains stumbled into the run-up on FEYE. FireEye has been trading sideways for years. The mini-üåù trip allowed some people a convenient exit point for profit-taking. The short-term chart (30min) shows the stock bouncing off a support level of around 22.35. Institutional holdings have gone up since 12/18. If it gets up above 23, there could be another decent run-up store (obligatory üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ). Prior to almost meme‚Äôing, volume was low (\~7m) and has increased to around 40m. The put/call ratio remains favorable (\~0.65). Options premiums have continued to go up; however, depending on where you look on the options chain there are bargains. Next ER is expected around 2/3/21, time options intelligently as the already inflated IV can lead to an even bigger crush.

CRWD has gapped up twice in Dec, once after the hack and once earlier in the month. This has happened in the middle of a 30% run-up. IV is actually at a historical low (\~60) and options volume remains high. 

https://preview.redd.it/7cjnp5njft761.png?width=1098&format=png&auto=webp&s=f1b85e42140e4546167c76f6c1d1342a49eaa530

PANW jumped in mid-November after an earnings miss (-2.36 on an expected 1.33). Why did jump after a big miss? Because 2020. It had the sector-wide gap up on 12/18 of around 5%, but volume and IV have not gone up significantly since.

FTNT has been rolling up steadily for a couple of months now, having had a 30% run-up. Same 12/18 pop. The difference is that prior to the 10/29 ER, it dropped from 130 to 110 and has been making up ground since then. When you put the last couple of months in that context, it feels like there is more room to go up.

NET (Cloudflare) has a similar feel to CRWD. There was a big jump in Oct (44 to 60) in response to product announcements, but a limited response to the hack.

**Plays**

FEYE could achieve full meme status. There are still some deals to be had in the options chain if you hunt around. ATM calls for a couple of weeks out are still reasonable, with break-evens that are below the recent peak (25.46). If the drop at the end of the spike was profit-taking, then it could go to a price target of 30 or even üöÄüåù.

FTNT feels like a solid long-term play. The fundamentals are good, YoY growth is great but not spectacular, and it‚Äôs trading at a P/E that‚Äôs low compared with everyone else. Naturally, it will beat earnings in February and immediately drop 20%.

Options for CRWD and NET have a big greed premium attached to them. Cloudflare (NET) still hasn‚Äôt had the same gap up others have, but it‚Äôs at the end of a big run-up. There‚Äôs a decent chance they will both get an earnings beat in February, especially as companies hand out contracts after the hack. Impossible to predict how things will go after that ‚Äì probably up bigly as people have attached huge P/E ratios to both.

I‚Äôm still trying to figure out how to play CHKP and MRVL.

As always ‚Äì information and plays here are suggestions only. Invest at your own risk.
