Cramer thinks we have the best DD and we're all 12 years old. [Skip to 0:28] _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ AMD getting ready to rally! _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Goodshit _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Why settle for KNDI, when you can have TENDIES? Alright listen up dipshits, prepare for the gayest bear DD you’ve ever attempted to read but stopped halfway through because there was a four-syllable word.

TLDR: KNDI is a circle-jerk scam of Chinese meme gods that is bound to leave a bukkake-sized load on the face of the EV industry before its delisted and the execs are sent to gulags.

Position: $5P exp 6/18/21. Enter when the stock is between 10-11 and expect to average down until these motherfuckers are pocket change. Then wait.

Now, before the actual DD, I implore you to simply google what KNDI’s product is. It looks like the minivan and a Smart Car were somehow cousins and KNDI is the autistic offspring. And you retards think this has a shot against all the cybertrucks this sub is going to run them over with? Good luck. I’d take TSLAQ level losses on this play before you could pay me to cash out on a KNDI vehicle with my tendies.

I’m going to be upfront, if you’re interested in this play, read the Hindenburg Research reports. This dd is moreso about the feasibility of KNDI in scaling, which presents significant risk to investors, which given that they haven’t been able to raise a market cap at all yet, means they never will.
The number one claim to fame this stock has is that it made the cheapest EV. Cool. It’s almost like the Chinese didn’t yet have a reputation for flooding the American market with cheap goods. The problem with that business model in this application, is that it has to present a feasible alternative to its competition. And if you think for a single fucking second that this company can compare with Meme Lord Elon, youre an even gayer bear than I am. 
So in addition to not being able to sell to American consumers, it appears they can’t even sell to Chinese consumers either. Essentially, it’s extremely likely that their balance sheets and revenue are completely fraudulent, and that the execs of the company have literally just been buying their own cars and counting it as sales. The reasoning for fraud is that the company has been through three auditors already, and one of them is banned from ever auditing in China again after fucking up harder than you retards fumble earnings calls.

Electrical-based technology is the future; and electrical technology requires copper.
 
Just look to Tesla’s 10% gain in share price today and profit numbers last quarter (surpassing expectations).
 
Tesla is not an auto company – it is a *technology* company, involved with a spectrum of industries: automotive, space, electronics, high-speed transportation, solar power, among others.
 
And Tesla is just one firm of many in the tech space – this is seen in the NASDAQ, for example, which up nearly 50% in the past year *alone*! The tech sector is experiencing growth at an *astounding* pace.
 
With all this technology and need for copper – it’s no surprise that Copper is approaching it’s highest prices since January 2011!
 
And where will this COPPER *come from*??
 
######Enter Freeport-McMoRan ($FCX) :
 
$FCX is an American-based mining firm – one of the largest producers of copper in the world.
 
The fact that $FCX is American is important. A majority of $FCX’s mines are in the USA (9 out of 13). With global tensions between China and USA running high, it is anticipated that copper sourced and purchased locally may provide major benefits to American tech firms in the future. For example, tariffs on foreign metals may be implemented if China-USA tensions continue – making American copper that much more enticing to both investors and enterprises alike. China poses a major threat: over the past decade they have ramped up precious earth metal mining to record levels. US Government way put in place new laws to help incentivize American mining firms like $FCX to also expand their mining practices. $FCX would be a prime benefactor of a government policy move, should one take place.
 
There is no doubt that $FCX will be a huge player in the Copper mining/distribution in the future – and this is made dramatically clear in the growth of it’s stock price: Up 50% in past 3 months, Up 125% in past 6months!
 
Current price: $FCX = $24.60

why tf none of you gamblers are talking about this? anyway, DKNG is disgustingly undervalued (currently \~48$), and I can easily see 300% gains in next 2 years, and have 70$ target in mind in next 1-3 months

**short term bullish**

1. united states are starting to legalize online sports betting, and are doing it fast one by one (last they did so in MI, they are launching in early 2021)
2. 2020 was void of sports due to beer plague, and all big competitions (euro soccer, olympics etc) are moved to 2021, and 2022 is following immediately with world cup
3. company still had great profits (i'm sure some - probably one or two of you - can read financial statements better than me, but what i have seen is pretty good)

**long term bullish**

1. legalization in the US
2. US is really young market compared to europe and asia, it's actually funny - there is so much space to grow it's insane
3. management - guy that started this, could've cashed out a long time ago - but here he is, company has no debt, and is valued 20 bil during global pandemic when most of the sport was canceled, postponed etc, computer science and marketing major - golden ticket in this industry (lots of dinosaurs that still think retail betting - betshops, ssbt-s are a way to go
4. clean balance sheet - 2.5 bil assets, 0.5 bil liabilities and no debt

been working in the online sports betting and online casino industry for the past 3 years, so i've got some insights on the topic

industry insight:

\- average hold (how much the house keeps of each bet) is 7% for prematch (matches that you bet on before they begin)- average hold for live bets is around 11% (margins are insane here)- average return to player on casino games is around 95% (so 5% hold on each spin on online casino)- player retention is off the charts, **average** session duration of around 20 minutes- players that register and make deposit are not going anywhere, where they usually start betting, continue betting there for a long time (there are a few reasons for this, not sure how interested you are in this though)- acquisition cost per customer drops steadily more players you have- US has really just began embracing online sports betting market (huge upside potential)- increase in operations cost for each new player is negligible

wouldn't be surprised if this went to moon in the near future

The bounce at the 0.5 held and we've just broken above the 0.618 of the only remaining bearish fib left.

What we want to see here is that PLTR can stay above that 0.618. A bit of a sell reaction is to be expected (just like what happened when it broke above the 0.5 earlier today), but it's important to recognise that PLTR could reverse here for another leg lower. As far as sell-side Fib traders are concerned, 29 USD is exactly where that reversal would happen.

As can be seen from the volume profile (far left) there's seldom trade volume above here. This is excellent for bulls because it means a lack of 'trapped' longs that are desperate for a chance to get out at break even.

**tl;dr: first upside target is 39.3, but watch for a reversal to the downside here at 29**

Elon Musk says we need to double the world's electricity by 2040. How is that going to happen--Solar? No. Wind? No. 

The only way to ramp up base-load capacity so quickly is more natural gas, coal, or nuclear plants.  Natgas and coal are out because they aren't green. Nuclear is the best option.

Here's the quick and dirty DD:

To get nuclear plants going, we need to mine uranium. Uranium stocks have roofed the last two trading sessions because congress just passed a bill to start a US stockpile of the stuff for national security purposes. The scramble to get mines operational has begun, but that's only the trigger that will set off a much longer rally based on industry-specific factors. 

The fact is, the world is set to go into a decade-long drawdown of uranium inventories. Despite the Fukushima disaster last decade, nuclear capacity will continue to grow year after year, but mines aren't keeping up. That's going to set the price of uranium soaring, from around $30 per pound today, to $50 or even more, so that mines actually get paid to produce.

Uranium mining companies like Cameco (CCJ in the US exchange and CCO in Canada) are levered to the price of uranium, so that when the uranium price rises, the stock prices rise even more. And with options, idiots like us at WSB can be levered on top of that leverage. The daily gains can be explosive. 

That's how I made 55.8% today: options on CCJ. See the screenshot. A good chunk of these options were out of the money when I bought them, but now they're all in the money. What can I say--sometimes the idiots at WSB do win! I should have bought even further out of the money, like CCJ 14 Jan 21 calls, given the pace the underlying is currently moving.

Positions: Lost almost all my portfolio due to palantir so I could only do  55c 24,2020  at 1.28

AZN is a multinational pharmaceutical and biopharma company with over 70k employees. Before I even start let’s look at its revenue.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gz9qt80smt361.png?width=1272&format=png&auto=webp&s=fa13fc08771057a10d27bed1b57fae4826b04324

You can see that it has been consistently profitable while also maintaining growth. It had a net income of around 1.2 billion dollars in 2019. Now you might say this is a hold stock. Well that’s true. You can do your own dd for its vaccine  but rn its kinda shit. It  has  weird results and allegedly stated “it administered the wrong dose amount” yet that resulted in a 90%.

“The vaccine stopped an average of 70% of participants from falling ill, an [early analysis](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/terminal/QK8M480C92BS) of the data show. The effectiveness rose to 90% for one of two regimens, using half a dose followed by a full one later, close to the high bar set by Pfizer Inc. and Moderna Inc.”-Bloomberg

Now if they are able to do something and establish a better foothold the stock will probably skyrocket. So far the vaccine has been priced in however the vaccine has been priced in by how much it sucks so if they are able to do anything to increase it to around the 95%< mark I think they will become a major footholder in the vaccine race. However, that is a big if so fuck that don’t be retarded and take the risk. I want to focus on something that will make you retards quickckkkk money. On december 20 AZN and its partner Fibrogen Inc. have a pdfua set for the drug Roxadustat. It is an oral pill which is used for the treatment of Chronic Kidney Disease with anemia. Now there are around “more than 37 million American adults may have CKD,1 and it is estimated that more than 1 out of every 7 people with kidney disease have anemia. Most people who have kidney failure—when kidney damage is so advanced that less than 15 percent of the kidney is working normally—also have anemia.”-[www.niddk.nih.gov](http://www.niddk.nih.gov/)

With this a 37 million reach just in America is no joke. If this is approved the smallest dose of Roxadustat (10mg) goes for 60USD. So their new market just in the US is a cap of 2,220,000,000 dollars….. Now I could go into the chemistry for this however I think those who actually read this will do their own dd into it. So let’s get into if this will pass or not. Now I am telling you this it is 95% going to be approved. 

Why? 

Roxadustat is currently approved in China for the treatment of anemia in patients with CKD, regardless of whether they require dialysis, and in Japan for the treatment of dialysis patients with anemia of CKD. FibroGen’s partner Astellas also intends to file a marketing authorization application with the European Medicines Agency in the first half of 2020.

\-biospace

Also, if you want more proof the fda didn’t even have to hold a advisory meeting for this and its establishment as a working treatment with little to no side effects has already been established. So if this passes. Fibrogen Inc with ticker Fgen will actually skyrocket and AZN will as well through direct partnership and the fact that they are going to commercialize together. So you can get into whichever ticker you wish tbh but I chose AZN. This comes out december 20,2020 so positions for December 24 will be good and I am a bit skeptical for AZN long term growth for their vaccine but for this quick pump and maybe not dump I would recommend buying a couple of options at least. 

Most recent news:

AZN is looking to get emergency approval for its covid vaccine and since India is corrupt it will probably go through ;however, they will not have the same reach as pfizer due to their weird ass results

This article points out that upper management never planned to permanently close any locations; I believe this was a major mistake as they could have used this pandemic to trim their less profitable locations and focus on improving their money makers. This means they have just been paying all the expenses on these properties while they don't make them ANY money.

the company just sold a bunch of this shit called junk bonds to keep them above water. I don't know about you, but selling shit bonds because your business can't make money doesn't seem like a winning long term recovery strategy.

The stock jumped 28% after news of the COVID vaccine came out; not out of any boost in the valuation of the company. When the earnings come out this week, we will truly see how badly Dave Busted. This is going to drive the stock down, and I think we should all collectively short this little bitch. I don't even know if it helps me to have other people short the stock too, but fuck it, I kinda like some of you guys and this could be a guaranteed (terms and conditions apply) money maker.

PLAY 10 12/18 25P_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ AirBNB IPO preshares for hosts I know most of you won't care, but AirBNB is doing an IPO option for hosts at the initial strike price $44-50. I got in to buy up to 276 shares at the initial offer price (max available). This is basically what banks and large investors get before it opens up on the general market. There's a weird process where you have to make an account at morgan stanley and then fund it before December 9th. You have six hours after 6PM to confirm your allocation. Then I guess it's all to the moon. Anyways, I thought it was interesting they allowed plebeian retards to participate. To the moon!!!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $BBY tanking for 2 weeks What is going on with Best Buy. It's been selling off relentlessly for 2 weeks and I can't imagine that they are struggling right now. I've been in the store and done curbside pickup several times in the last month and it seems to be poppin.

Anyone have any theories on why they are selling off or when it might level off. 

If it hits 95 I'm going all-in, but its tempting to pick up some long term calls at the current price._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Thanks to EV hype, kids will have some food this winter. (TSLA, NIO) _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Why Canoo is Ahead of All Other EV SPACs and Will Change the EV Market **A Quick Intro:**

Canoo is an EV company going public through an SPAC merger later this month. Their 1st vehicle will begin mass production in 2022. You can look at it [HERE](https://www.canoo.com/design/)

It plans to offer it's product (vehicles) through a subscription based model. These subscriptions could be 1 month, 3 month, 6 month, 1+ year, etc. The subscription includes the vehicle, registration, maintenance, charging, and access to insurance.

**What Puts Them Ahead?**

There's a few things that do. The easiest to see is the fact that they have a product. Their first van type vehicle(aka the BangBus) has already went through 50 crash tests and has actually been driving on the  highway.

The most exciting fact is the **Skateboard Design.** First watch [THIS](https://youtu.be/8m3fRujSlW0). The skateboard is essentially everything that makes the car go. Combine this with their steer by wire design(frees up a ton of space and can be put anywhere) and you have everything you need to make the car drive in the floor of the vehicle. This means for every model they're just adding the top "shell" to the skateboard and BOOM: you have a vehicle. Once they finalize the skateboard design(which they pretty much have done) then they can pump out new EV models like nothing. I'm talking delivery van, pickup truck, sports car, sedan, etc. [This picture sums it up](https://i0.wp.com/alabamanewscenter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Canoo_Design_Exterior_Possibilities.jpg?ssl=1) All they have to do is the design work, slap it on the skateboard, and run some tests.

Their **Subscription Based Model** makes electric cars available to a a whole new market. This includes people who don't want to fully buy/own a car. The monthly fee covers literally everything so it's perfect for them. It includes people who can't afford to buy an electric car. The subscription model lowers the price of owning an EV, making it accessible to more customers. And then since it's easier for them to make new models, they may be the first to put an electric delivery van or pickup truck on the market. This would attract a TON of retail businesses/people.

Now the rest is **Purely Speculative** but there are plenty of potential deals that may arise that make a lot of sense. The most being an **Uber** or Lyft deal. The subscription model makes Canoo vehicles perfect for Uber drivers. No gas expense, no maintenance fee, won't have to dirty your own car, etc. And Uber could then play this up in advertising by saying many of their drivers "drive electric".

This is another popular one but a shot in the dark. **Apple** has been wanting to get into the EV game for awhile. Canoo would be the perfect target for an investment. An innovative product that rethinks how vehicles are traditionally made and sold. It's not like Apple has ever made anything like that before...........

**The Stock Itself:**

Canoo has largely been under the radar until the past week or so. They have a lot of good things happening this month, which could serve as major catalysts. They're unveiling their delivery van on December 17th, voting on the merger on the 21st, and who knows what else might happen. Canoo is being valuated at $2.4 billion through this merger, which is criminally low. The only way I see this company going is up from here on out.

[Watch this is you want to feel as confident as I am in this company](https://youtu.be/9F_W8pev4XQ)

TLDR; Shares, Warrants, Calls. They all go.

Edit: Forgot to add that they have an engineering contract with Hyundai and Kia to help them develop a skateboard for their Electric line of cars. An EV company with a product AND revenue?? Is this possible? Also there's already 15,000 reservations for it's van with no marketing_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $PSEC FTW!!! Strap yourself to this rocketship for some RTard Level 5 TENDIES! 💥 🚀 Gather round fellow autists! I have a story to tell. I recently happened upon a lil ol thing called $PSEC. Prospect Capital, that's right! This is a BDC which doesn't stand for Big Dong Cashmaker (not ***YET*** anyways) but I digress. This is a Biz Development Company. Which means a couple of *very* important things, so listen closely:

\- Businesses make $ 

\- Developing Business def makes beaucoup $$$

\- These BDCs are regulated by the SEC and are req'd to pass 90% of profits to shareholders. 

\- This is a stonk. Stonks only go up. 

\- Literally can't go tits up.

\- Money is good. me want. 

These mfers still haven't *fully* recovered since the beer flu (which is practically over btw, thanks Biden!). BDCs pay a pretty generous dividend and essentially trade on their dividend. Well, PSC's dividend is back in action after a brief pandy pause. I checked their most recent earnings transcript b/c my autism was dropping one afternoon and as luck would have it their dividend isn't going anywhere but (maybe) up for the foreseeable future. This ~~Big Dong Cashmaker~~ Business Development Company is effectively paying nearly 15% annual dividend (paid monthly) rn. If the stock stays flat, you're still earning approx 15%. BUT BDCs essentially trade on their dividend; PSEC's dividend has fully recovered and their stock price has not. And w/ interest rates likely to rise you can expect to see the popularity of investment vehicles like this one grow yada yada yada derr derr WSB autism. stfu and let's get some tendiezzz!!!

*Do your own DD mfers.*_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ /u/jagyolo is famous now _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ VTRS. Semi DD Semi- DD: here me out.  Two large generic pharma companies merged (viatris) with a market cap of only 20B.  If you look back 5 years ago the market cap alone of the one (Mylan) was 30B +.  If you add in the Pfizer side, the market cap would have been another 30B.   The one side, Mylan, is easy to read into. Mylan struggled bc of poor executive management, poor PR, and troubles with the FDA.  However, with the merger, the majority of executives from Mylan are leaving.  The most important part of their 5 year decline was their two largest manufacturing sites were under fda warning letter for a couple years which inhibits their output from over 30 billion doses per year to roughly 8-10 billion.  With the warning letters lifted, manufacturing should pick up..  Above and beyond Mylan the Pfizer side of the deal brings a significant number of well known products such as Viagara... Additionally, the two merged companies expect serious cash flow (4 billion a year of which they will pay out 1 billion a year in dividends) immediately and within the next 30-45 days will detail a $1 billion dollar annual cost savings plan.  

If you evaluate the historical Pfizer target of a dividend of 4%, this means viatris believes their stock price should currently be $20.  But this price point and stated dividend is prior to their 1 billion in cost savings, prior to manufacturing picking up and prior to new products in New markets.  this company is set to deliver big returns.  

This stock is likely to double or more in the next 6-12 months.  Looking at the options for July 2021 specially the $22 strike price, you should be able to make a killing assuming the company remotely executes.  

To summarize a Viagara driven stock rally by a newly formed massive us based pharma company.  

Lastly they are yet to announce their dividend but it’s likely to be solid out of the gates.

Ok, so I was long on WORK - left holding the bag following their IPO. With the recent acquisition announcement I broke even and then 6% return on top. Now WORK had been an eye sore in my portfolio and I was looking to cut my losses anyways so this announcement was a pleasant surprise and I can now get back my initial investment and some change. YAY.

“Under the terms of the agreement, **Slack** shareholders will receive $26.79 in cash and 0.0776 shares of Salesforce common stock for each **Slack** share, representing an enterprise value of approximately $27.7 billion based on the closing price of Salesforce's common stock on November 30, 2020,” the announcement reads.

So now I'm wondering... if someone was to ***hypothetically*** load up on WORK common stock now? Trading at $43.11 today - 2,000 shares for $86k. Based on the merger deal that breaks down as follows: 

2k \* $26.79 = $53,580

2k \* 0.0776 = 155.2 shares of CRM

Based on CRMs price today it would break even - maybe net a small return. One could likely hold CRM for a bit to maximize upside. What is the downside? CRM slides further and I one is back to being left holding a new, different bag?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ PLTR - When you get your family in on the spaceship to the fucking moon. _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ PLTR to the moon _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Do you like the way I flick my tongue or nah? _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ American Tower Gonna Print American Tower is one of the worlds largest REITs and focuses on the development and operation of a over 100,000 broadcasting and wireless communications sites.

Now given the fact that I don’t know shit about shit, right now AMT options are looking cheap as fuck because their implied volatility is so low, but their historical volatility points to a potential miss pricing of the near term contracts.

They are probably dropping from their debt offering in late November but since no one is partying at fucking cell towers and people are using wireless networks MORE I don’t know how this can go belly up their financials are a bit subpar but so are most other companies at this point. The fact they are getting into 5g is just another reason they have a bright future which I do not give a fuck about since that doesn’t mean dick for the short term.

I have the answers I have been collecting and analyzing data from popular subreddits. This week I am looking at the options contracts that have been mentioned on the subreddits I track.  Specifically, I am looking at contracts expiring this Friday 12/11.    The data collected for this analysis was collected from 11/29 – 12/5.  For Friday’s expiration there are 186 contracts and 330 mentions of these contracts.  The most popular contract is the 12/11 TSLA 600 Call with 14 mentions.  


The goal here is to track what reddit is following and to see how reddit preforms.  There is this notion that retail investors often fail to beat the market. This is why financial advisors recommend that you buy into the major ETF’s such as SPY.  As historically there have been few people that manage to beat the major Index’s year over year.  My hypothesis going into this week is that I should bet against the trends on reddit as typically the retail investor is wrong.  


Call Data


* Out of the 186 contracts 150 are calls (+80%+ Long)  

* 75.3% of the calls are out of the money

* The out of the money Calls are an average of 23% out of the money. 

* The in the money calls are an average of 19.3% in the money. 


Put Data


* Out of 186 Contracts 36 are puts

* 86.1% of the puts are out of the money

* The out of the money puts are an average of 20% out of the money

* The in the money puts are an average of 8% in the money 


On both the call and put sides the out of the money contracts are an average of 20%+ out of the money.  I am not that surprised as there is a lot of yolo culture on reddit.  It is surprising to see the number of contracts that are out of the money in general.  Out of the 186 contracts only 42 are in the money as of last Friday’s close. 

The most popular calls that are in the money are the 

* TSLA 570 – 590 
* ACB 10.  

The most popular puts that are in the money are all NKLA.  

The most popular calls that are out of the money are the 

* TSLA 600 - 650, 
* GME 20, 
* PLTR 25 - 40, 
* AMD 100, 
* SPY 370 - 380,
* APHA 9.  

The most popular puts that are out of the money are 

* NKLA 15, 
* PLTR 15 – 21, 
* NIO 40 
* ACB 7.  

As I said above my hypothesis going into this week is that the majority of these contracts will end up being losers.  Based on this data I would probably look to sell the 370 Spy Calls and TSLA 600 calls if my hypothesis turns out to be right.  For now this is just for fun, but I will be running more in-depth analysis to see if I find anything interesting. 

Edit For reference as of 12/7 Market Open:

* SPY 370 Calls: $2.10
* TESLA 600 Calls: $2500_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Luminar Technology Long - gapping up at each open! _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ 14.5k $PLTR put YOLO _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ SESN tendies holder Okay, I’ve posted once and commented once about SESN so this will be my 3rd and final post about this company in my very lazy shill campaign.

Q3 2020 for Dec 8th, the earnings are expected to be negative as well but the stock will go up. Last Friday was the best time to buy the stock before it goes up this earnings call. 

For those asking about the short squeeze, NOW LOOK at the expected Q4 2020 and Q1 2021. They’re both expected to be positive earnings. So the stock is just going to keep going up and any news about the future and Cohen will keep driving it up. At some point, in theory,  the short squeeze will happen.

Everyone and their wife’s boyfriend want CRISPR technology to be successful.  These have been running riot in the last few months, but they still have a long way to go.  CRSP, EDIT, NTLA are already old news.  Sure, you can cure beta-Thalassemia, and Sickle Cell Disease, easy-peasy.  The problem is that the double stranded breaks that CRISPR uses are super bad for you.  Google that shit.  That has been one of the ways scientists studying aging have prematurely aged mice in the lab.

Enter BEAM Therapeutics.  BEAM uses the same CRISPR concept to locate a specific spot in your DNA, but doesn’t require breaking the DNA strands at all.  They use a strategy called Base Editing, where the CRISPR protein finds the DNA that you want, and then they edit the single nucleotide by changing it into a different nucleotide.  It’s genius.  On top of that, they have the next, next technology: Prime Editing.  This makes a little nick in the DNA and also doesn’t require a double stranded break.

BEAM has a market cap of somewhere between $3 to $4 billion depending on the day.  They have enough funding secured for a 1-year runway.  There are recent successes with boomer CRISPR (looking at you CRSP) that will cause tons of money to flow into the gene editing field.  All of those companies have ultra-small market caps compared to the value they add to society.  I’m long the whole field, but because of the double stranded break issue, I have to believe Base Editing and Prime Editing are the future.

There has been a race in the EV space. Per the article, the current assessment is that Tesla is in the lead. A company with a shot at getting the second spot would be VW. If anyone is interested in finding out more about about VW's approach, it is helpful to read up on their actual approach (through Herbert Diess). His vision is to transform the company into a digital company which operates millions of mobility devices: https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-we-transform-volkswagen-herbert-diess/

This is important as it highlights the similarity with Tesla's approach to how the cars are conceived, built and updated. VW has a project named "Mission T" so this is no surprise. Approaching the car like a software product where the data plays a critical role. The product is used to collect data and feed it back to the manufacturer, so the relationship with the customer is not over once the sale is complete. The collected information is used to continuously enhance the product and create software updates and even new features (autonomous driving, etc.)

A company in the EV space using a more traditional approach will have hard time catching up as the the market leader will always be moving at an exponential rate.

They make a 3D printer that makes small metal parts that were once thought to be difficult and expensive to make. Now through a complicated process I don't understand well enough to explain, it can be printed saving time and money. The process is explained in way more detail on their [website.](https://www.desktopmetal.com/)

They have a variety of different products, including a range in systems from smaller scale production designed for engineers building prototypes, to a larger scale printer for mass production. The metals they print include Copper, two different grades of stainless steel and three other metals I don't know anything about. Again more details on their [website.](https://www.desktopmetal.com/materials)

Customers listed on their website include 3M, Medtronic, Toyota, BMW, and even the US military. Basically any company that produces anything with small metal parts could in theory become a customer making the growth potential astronomical. The industry as a whole is expected to grow from a total of $12 Billion today, to $150 Billion by the end of 2030.

The key difference between this company and it's competitors is something called "single jet passing." Through this process, the system can produce everything faster than any other system currently available.

There are however draw backs to the company. They are relatively new, and therefor need to expand to reach their full potential. The industry as a whole also takes time to change, and growth for the company will progress as slowly as their market changes. As a result DM's aggressive targets for growth seem difficult to attain. Essentially, patience will be key as most of their current and immediate value will be dependent on the hype they generate.

The stock is up 75% in the past few weeks, so it's really no secret. The buy low opportunity has come and gone. But the long term payday here is immense. It's being regarded as a potential 10 bagger based off of industry trends.

Alex Karp, the co-founder and CEO of Palantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR), spoke via teleconference on December 3 with Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis about Palantir’s ever-expanding partnership with the government of Greece to support their COVID-19 response efforts. Dr. Karp and Prime Minister Mitsotakis were joined by Palantir Executive Josh Harris and Kyriakos Pierrakakis, Minister of Digital Governance of Greece, to explore new ways to keep Greece ahead of the curve with their public health response.

Since the start of the pandemic, Palantir has worked with the Greek government to help enable data-driven decision-making in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic response. The government is leveraging Palantir’s Foundry software platform on top of Amazon Web Services infrastructure to deliver COVID-19 response workflows to government officials responding to the pandemic. Of particular value has been the deployment of a crisis-control center dashboard for the Prime Minister, which displays a holistic overview of the state of the COVID-19 pandemic in Greece in real time.

“Our partnership with the Greek government was borne out of necessity once the pandemic began,” said Alex Karp, co-founder and CEO of Palantir Technologies. “We have readily played a key role in their COVID-19 response effort, which from our experience has been one of the best in the world, and we look forward to broadening this partnership for years to come.”

The Ministry of Digital Governance, leading Greece’s rapid digital transformation, played a pivotal role in facilitating the partnership swiftly, enabling top decision makers to start generating actionable insights within a matter of days. As the pandemic continues to evolve, Palantir will deliver advanced integration and analytic capabilities to a range of government initiatives, to enable data-driven decision-making.

So in short, $SNOW has risen rampantly recently and become a bubble. People only see the headline revenue growth without noticing its **declining growth rate, declining NVRR, significantly worse-than-estimate EPS, below-average guidance, and intensifying industry competition**. Among all the companies with 50+B market cap in the US stock market history, **none of them** has come even **remotely close** to $SNOW’s **INSANE** valuation.

&#x200B;

**Position**: 12/18 350P, 1/15 300P, 5/19 250P.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2020 is coming to an end. This year we have witnessed the almighty power of retail investors -- buying blindly after reading just headlines; following 18yo investing “gurus” on Twitter, TikTok, or StockTwits;  and riding pump-and-dump schemes trying to take advantage of greater fools. Against this backdrop, we managed to create a bubble as big as $SNOW. Now trading at $113B, $SNOW’s current valuation dwarfs other tech firms at the height of the dotcom bubble in 2000.

&#x200B;

# Why Are People Buying $SNOW?

$SNOW reported earnings for the first time last week. Its result was slightly upbeat, although I would rather call it **mixed**. However, retail investors do not care about the actual state of the company. **The only thing that matters is how the news headlines are reporting it.** Since headlines read “$SNOW Q3 revenue growth over 100% yoy”, people have now started buying fearlessly, without realizing how much of a bubble $SNOW has already become.

&#x200B;

# What the Headlines Do Not Tell: the Ugly Facts behind $SNOW’s Valuation

**1. $SNOW’s revenue beats estimate, but not by much, and it’s far from a surprise**

Q3 revenue is 159.6M, which beats estimate 147.1M by only **8.5%.** Yet, stock price has risen **40**\+%, from 290$ to 400+$. Something does not add up here. $ZM rose about that much after its Q2 earnings. but $ZM’s revenue beat estimate **more than 30%?** Moreover, $ZM gave up most of that gain just a couple of days later. And now after 3 months, it is still trading lower than back then. **Don't you see that $SNOW’s jump is a lot more overdone?**

&#x200B;

**2. $SNOW’s revenue growth rate and net revenue retention rate is already DECLINING.**

Source: [S-1 Form](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001640147/1c70b06a-4d3b-4a37-9c42-76ec47742398.pdf) [10-Q Form](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001640147/afd24d78-1425-49ca-9cd9-6ae57c5712c0.pdf)

It’s true that $SNOW’s revenue grew more than 100+% yoy this quarter. But if you expect its revenue to keep doubling forever, **you would be completely delusional**.

$SNOW’s revenue of fiscal year ending Jan 2019 and Jan 2020, was $96.7M and $264.7 million → **174% yoy growth.**

$SNOW’s revenue of six months ending Jul 2019 and Jul 2020, was $104.0M and $242.0M → **133% yoy growth.**

And now $SNOW reports Q3 yoy revenue growth **115%**. Do you recognize a trend here?

**174% > 133% > 115%**

**Its growth rate is DECLINING**, people! **It cannot keep growing 100+% over the next few years**. $SNOW grows fast right now because its current revenue is **too small**, **smaller than 1/200 of its market cap**. As the company matures, it's almost certain that growth will slow down.

**Same story with the net revenue retention rate** (NVRR), which the SaaS industry uses as a valuation matric. Retail investors read the headline and see a 162% NVRR, thinking “this must be a buy”. But back in Jan 2020, NVRR was 180%. As of Jul 2020, it was 169%. And now, it is 162%. **180% > 169% > 162% right?**

&#x200B;

**3. Positive revenue growth does NOT mean $SNOW is making more money. In fact, $SNOW’s EPS is 3 times WORSE than estimate. $SNOW is not expected to make money even in 2023.**

Q3 **EPS is -1.01$** vs estimate **-0.26$. $SNOW is LOSING 3 times more money than expected** to realize that revenue growth, which beat estimate by only 8.5%.

**3 TIMES** EPS miss → just **8.5%** revenue growth beat? Does that really sound positive to you?

As I quote the company’s SEC filing again, “*We have incurred substantial losses during our history,* ***do not expect to become profitable in the near future, and may never achieve profitability***.” I really wonder all this extreme hype surrounding $SNOW is based on what? Are retail investors really seeing something that even the company itself does not see into the future? Or **is everybody just dreaming**?

Goldman Sachs estimates $SNOW will still be bleeding money even in 2023.

&#x200B;

**4. Q4 revenue guidance is BELOW AVERAGE estimate**

For Q4, $SNOW projects $162-$167M in revenue, which is below the average estimate $166M. This is largely the reason why **$SNOW’s price was falling at first after earnings.** As the more rational $SNOW investors are selling their shares, bagholders on Twitter, TikTok or whatever, start to pump the stock using **cherry-picked positive numbers**.

Some analyst says the guidance “could be” conservative. Conservative based on what? Based on the fact that you are long so you want to pump the stock? With the declining growth rate as we have seen, the guidance makes perfect sense.

Another cloud company, $SPLK also reported Q3 revenue this week. It missed estimate by 9% and its stock dropped 23%? Was its estimate also “conservative”, Mr. analyst?

&#x200B;

**5. $SNOW’s market cap is even higher than its Total Addressable Market (TAM) of 2023.**

According to IDC, the markets for Analytics Data Management and Integration Platforms and Business Intelligence and Analytics Tools, which $SNOW addresses, will have a combined value of $56 billion by the end of 2020 and **$84 billion by the end of 2023**. Let’s not talk about how **$SNOW’s market cap is even larger than the its entire market in 2023**. But how much of market share can $SNOW realistically achieve?

Its FY2021 revenue estimate 578M is **only about 1% of the total market**. For SNOW’s market cap to make sense, people are expecting it to own at least half of market share of the entire market in the long run. Is that possible? Cloud is an industry with ever tougher competition. You **expect $SNOW to grow its industry presence by 50 times, while other competitors: Amazon, Google, Microsoft do nothing, sit idly and watch**? There will be more discussion on this later.

&#x200B;

**6. $SNOW’s CEO’s compensation is worth MORE than the company’s revenue!**

[Source](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-04/snowflake-ceo-collects-a-95-million-payout-every-month#:~:text=Snowflake%20CEO%20Collects%20a%20%24108%20Million%20Payout%20%E2%80%94%20Every%20Month,-By&text=A%20compensation%20package%20he%20received,or%20about%20%241.3%20billion%20annually)

CEO Frank Slootman now collects **$108M** worth of compensation **every month**. That’s **324M per quarter**, but the **company’s quarterly revenue is only 160M**? I know the compensation is not all cash, but linked to RSUs and options. Yet still, doesn’t it ring an alarm bell? At what other company can **a CEO be paid twice the entire company’s revenue**? And it’s REVENUE, not profit! The company has no profit yet. Doesn’t this illustrate how insane the company’s valuation has become?

# 

# How Does $SNOW Compare to $ZM, $TSLA, and the Dot-com Bubble

**1. vs Analysts’ price targets**

I personally do not trust analysts’ targets. This year, analysts are handing out positive ratings like candies. We have seen **crazy sh\*t targets like a 79$ for $NKLA**. Lol. And moreover, **$SNOW’s IPO have pretty much everybody on the street as its underwriter**. This make the banks **more biased** to give a buy rating.

Even so, $SNOW’s current price is still **much higher than even the most bullish analyst**. Analysts want retail people to buy blindly. They just did not expect people could go **THIS blind**.

JP Morgan target: 250$ (36% down potential)

Morgan Stanley: 265$ (32% down potential)

Credit Suisse: 265$ (32% down potential)

Goldman Sachs: 308$ (20% down potential)

&#x200B;

**2. $ZM**

If you are that impressed with SNOW’s 100% revenue growth, you probably forgot about **$ZM’s 367% yoy growth this quarter?** Not only did that beat estimate by 12%, its EPS also beat by over 30%. Even so, **$ZM's price fell after earnings because it didn't live up to people's expectation**. So  what are people expecting for $SNOW's next quarter? $SNOW’s market cap is now almost as big as $ZM’s, although with **only 1/5 revenue, 1/3 growth rate, and a negative EPS.**

If you think $ZM is trading cheap because vaccine is coming and WFH is ending, but $SNOW is trading expensive because WFH does not have an impact on $SNOW’s business. **Think twice**. **WFH has accelerated cloud adoption**. As people cannot go to office to maintain on-premise data storage solutions, companies were forced to embrace the benefit of cloud. **Same with video conferencing, after WFH ends, growth in cloud business will decelerate**.

When the vaccine news came out on Dec 9 and Dec 10, **both $ZM and $SNOW fell significantly**. This proves **$SNOW also belong to the WFH stock category**. With vaccine FDA approval on near horizon, $SNOW is destined to fall again.

&#x200B;

**3. $TSLA**

I don’t have a view on $TSLA, I just want to compare. There are some people who think $TSLA is overvalued. I guess they never heard about $SNOW. **$TSLA’s valuation is nothing when compared to $SNOW.**

* $TSLA’s P/S ratio is smaller than 20. While $SNOW’s is close to 200. **10x as big.**
* $TSLA’s P/E ratio is positive, with forward 12M P/E at 162. Whereas $SNOW will be bleeding money even in 2023.
* $TSLA has a chance to become the leader in EV industry, like an iPhone among all mobile phones. Can $SNOW become the leader in the cloud space? Highly unlikely.
* EV market annual growth rate is expected to be 21% [Source](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/05/15/2034346/0/en/Electric-Vehicle-EV-Market-to-Rise-at-21-1-CAGR-till-2026-Product-Innovations-are-Leading-to-Wider-Adoption-says-Fortune-Business-Insights.html), while IDC forecasts SNOW’s industry to grow only 15% annually.

&#x200B;

**4. The dot-com bubble**

Through the stock market history, **no company at $SNOW’s size has been trading at such high valuation multiples**. Among all the companies with a 100+B market cap… You know what, let’s make our comparison even broader, let’s look at **all the companies larger than $50B**. Amid the 2000 tech bubble, $CSCO was trading at the highest P/S ratio. **On Mar 22, 2000, $CSCO’s P/S reached all time high of 57**. It’s been 20 years now. After the bubble popped, CSCO’s **price today is** **still more than 40% lower than 20 years ago**.

Now you would argue, $CSCO and $MSFT etc. are big mature companies, how can you compare a growth company like $SNOW with them? Well, **20 years ago, $CSCO and $MSFT were growth companies too**. A lot of the “growth” companies back then, do not even EXIST anymore. Do you really want to compare $SNOW with those bankrupted companies?

Microsoft’s highest P/S ever: only **29,** reached during dot-com bubble.

Google’s highest P/S: **22 in 2005**.

Facebook’s highest P/S: **22.2 in 2014**.

Apple’s highest P/S: only **8, reached in August this year**. (Yes Apple’s P/S was even lower when first iPhone was launched)

**NO BIG TECH HAS REACHED A BUBBLE OF THIS SCALE EVER. Like, ever.**

# The Myths People Are Spreading about $SNOW

**MYTH 1: Warren Buffet invested in $SNOW, which means you should buy too.**

**BUSTED**! Warren Buffet is a value investor known for his reluctance to invest in technology. Of course **he did NOT participate in $SNOW IPO**. Oh dear god, please wake up, people! Buffett's deputies, namely Ted Weschler and Todd Comms, invested in $SNOW, **not Warren Buffet himself**!

[Source](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/mergers-and-acquisitions/buffetts-deputies-bring-in-bets-from-snowflake-to-scripps-1#:~:text=Warren%20Buffett%20may%20have%20his,thank%20for%20a%20busy%20September.&text=financing%20deal%20announced%20Thursday%20and,Ted%20Weschler%20and%20Todd%20Combs%20)

And now people are **using this as a propaganda to pump $SNOW**. “Warren Buffett bought, you should buy too!”

Yet I still do not understand the logic here. **Berkshire bought $SNOW when it was 120$ per share**, probably expected to make like 30%, 50% from their investments. And now, **you crazy retail people are buying $SNOW at 400$ per share, more than 3x IPO price**? What? So your investment logic is: **Anything Buffett buys, you would buy it at 3x price?** Oh in that case, if I am Warren Buffett, I would just buy everything in sight, then there will be some retards willing to pay me 3x price I paid. Lol, I just discovered an infinite money making machine.

**If you believe in Berkshire, you should YOLO your money in $BRK/B, not $SNOW!** Or alternatively, you can read Berkshire's 13F filing which lists most of its investment. You should **start buying every single stock in that list until it goes to 3x current price**. Why don't you do that?

&#x200B;

**MYTH 2: $SNOW has technology that nobody else has and will achieve monopoly in the cloud space.**

I fully expect there will be $SNOW cultists arguing in the comment section “nobody competes with $SNOW because they are the best. You don’t understand its business.” blahblah. So, I hereby quote the company’s own words.

$SNOW competes with “*1. large, well-established, public cloud providers that generally compete in all of our markets, including* ***AWS, Azure, and GCP***\*; 2. less-established public and private cloud companies...; 3. other established vendors of legacy database solutions or big data offerings; and 4. new or emerging entrants seeking to develop competing technologies\*.” The company recognizes “*The markets in which we operate are highly competitive.* ***Many of our competitors have substantially greater brand recognition, customer relationships, and financial, technical, and other resources than we do***\*\*.\*\*”

The biggest difference between Snowflake and others that I see, is that $SNOW bills customer per usage, while others often adopt fixed contracts. Other than this, there may be a couple more of data types supported, or a bit more optimization here and there. I **don’t see anything game changing** with Snowflake that other competitors are unable to offer. Plus, the competition is getting real intense. Just days ago **Microsoft announced the launch of Azure Synapse to compete with Snowflake and alike**. [Source](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-03/microsoft-takes-on-amazon-snowflake-in-cloud-data-services)

And moreover,

*“****We currently only offer our platform on the public clouds provided by AWS, Azure, and GCP, which are also some of our primary competitors****. There is risk that one or more of these public cloud providers could use their respective control of their public clouds to embed innovations or privileged interoperating capabilities in competing products, bundle competing products,* ***provide us unfavorable pricing***\*, leverage its public cloud customer relationships to exclude us from opportunities, and treat us and our customers differently…\*”

**This is the RISKIEST part of $SNOW’s business**. **$SNOW is running its cloud on the infrastructure provided by its COMPETITORS**. Huh? Isn't it the same as **exposing your biggest weakness to your rivals**? Even if $SNOW manage to grab a much larger market share and become No.1 in the cloud space, if Amazon or Microsoft find $SNOW a threat and want to hamper its growth, **they can simply stop offering their infrastructure or raise the price**? If that happens, how is $SNOW going to survive then? **$SNOW's lifeline is literally in the hands of its biggest competitors!**

If you are buying $SNOW at current valuation amid the ever-intensifying competition in cloud space, fantasizing how $SNOW will beat everybody else, then **I think you are kidding yourself**.

&#x200B;

# Some Final Words

I am not trying to convince you to go short, you are more than welcome to pump the price higher, then I can add some more puts. I just hope people can reflect on their rationale of buying $SNOW at 400$ per share. Do you really have a logical point, or are you just blindly following some random headlines? It’s your own money. Make your own decision.

FYI, yes some others have mentioned on this sub that **$SNOW’s lockup will start to expire in a week’s time**. That is correct.

GG, I'm done. 20x leverage isn't a game. TLDR: Hedged a long position whilst down -£70k on ElectionDay-1. Markets turned bullish. Didn't trade out of my hedge. Flipped to a short view and closed my long following bearish news flow. Got killed for it throughout Nov. Position was leveraged 20x using a margin account. Closed the position after index hit a new high. Panick-hedged, panic sold. Love the game. Played it badly.

This was supposed to be a HEDGE against my core (long + 20x leveraged) position; opened the Monday before the US election. Markets were tanking, so went short to protect my downside risk.

My long allowed a 1000pt drop on the UK index (about 18%) before I'd get closed out. I figured it'll never happen in a day, so I can always trade against my core position if needed to ride out downward swings - plenty of time to react. Months went by and I found myself -800pts down after a bout of uncertainty in October; US election was 1 day out and markets were drilling hard.

My short position was opened at 1am UK time, outside of trading hours. With the negative news flow, talks of no stimulus, and a new Biden govt that wasn't market-focused, I genuinely thought there was some sell-side action about to kick off.  I figured the hedge would at least let me come back in at a lower level as any long losses would cancel out with my short gains. 

Markets opened around 5650 at the open (I hedged short at 5544 so already -£8000 down on the hedge after 7hrs). Never dipped lower again. I'd essentially locked in my losses at this point and didn't want to let go of the hedge position so soon as the election hadn't even happened yet - it's still 1st Nov. 

Market's took off that week; then came the vaccine news on 9th from Pfizer, and again on 16th Nov. My hedge at a bigger loss than my core position within minutes of the first announcement (was about 6:35am US time iirc, 11:35am UK). That was 9th Nov. It's been a painful 4 weeks. 

Closed my core position a few days later - I still ask myself why; I proceeded to  💎🤲🏽 this one hoping markets would dip lower. The news flow was still dismal for the UK outlook. Been 🤞🏻 for a month but in the last week Brexit news and vaccine news seems to have accelerated the buying action. Today I saw -£80,000 I hit the button immediately.

Obviously, the market's now moving down and I could have closed out at -£74,000 if I'd waited 3hrs. Would I have closed out though? Probably not.

KBNT - Kubient, I see a single post on here about this a few months back and they were right, they needed to prove the product and get some revenue.

Net revenue for the third quarter increased to $280,000 from $92,000 in the prior quarter and from $56,000 in Q3 of last year.

***TLDR:*** Stacks of stonks make memes, get them back or the dream dies. See you in 2021, thanks for the laughs you degenerates._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ LMPX - high-growth disruptor in the automotive industry. LMPX - an opportunity to 3-4x your investment within a year.

Briefly about the company: LMP Automotive is an online auto dealership which is positioning itself to be a disruptor through its subscription model and online platform.

&#x200B;

**Let's look at what happened to the firm recently:**

\- COVID-19 boosted LMPX's online sales and turbocharged the industry's transition to the online channel, subscription models and ride-sharing.

\- LMPX grew topline revenue by 240% in the 9 months of FY2020. I am projecting revenues to triple for the full year 2020 and at least double in FY2021. I will briefly talk about the valuation later.

\- Management announced a major acquisition and substantial investment in new auto inventory as well as new facilities to expand its business. After analyzing management commentaries, it is evident that there is a supply constraint which prevented revenues from increasing much more than 240%. Expansion plans will allow LMPX to grow revenues rapidly going into 2021 and 2022.

\- LMPX announced partnerships which shows that suppliers are eager to partner with LMPX and see the firm's growth potential and a promising business model.

&#x200B;

**Upcoming catalysts in the next 6-9 months:**

Disclosures in company reports as well as commentary from the CEO indicate LMPX stock can get a substantial boost from the following upcoming catalysts:

\- Successful closing of financing agreements with banks and closing of the ongoing acquisition.

\- Significant expansion of its online platform with approx. 10,000 autos being planned to be placed on the platform.

Quoting the CEO: "we are one of the top 3 online-centric automotive companies in the country, but better than that, we're all about performance, we're all about execution. We believe that will drive sales to levels that it will be harder to fulfill than actually having the leads and lead conversions given the test markets and given the competition. That I believe will be the largest catalyst, when we put it all online."

Also, insiders own around 40% of the outstanding shares and are aligned with investors. Recently, insiders have been accumulating more shares in the 10-20 dollar price range and the CEO mentioned in an interview that he believes the stock significantly undervalues the company's near-term fundamentals which is the reason for such high insider ownership. What this all means is that 2021 can be a blockbuster year for LMPX and its stock.

&#x200B;

**Market opportunity / TAM:**

\- Subscription based vehicle sales are estimated to account for 10% of all vehicle sales by 2025, which translates into a $100 billion opportunity by 2025. LMPX is one of the first movers and is expected to capture a large portion of this growing market.

\- The fact that LMPX revenues are up so much when the rest of the auto industry is down due to the pandemic indicates that LMPX is a disruptor and could see revenues multiply very soon.

&#x200B;

**Valuation and price target:**

\- LMPX delivered revenues of approx. $26million in the 9 months of FY2020. I estimate full year 2020 revenues to come in at about $33 million which equates to a 200% increase over FY2019.

\- With the stock trading at $27 and with 10 million shares outstanding, LMPX has a market cap of $270 million. On a price to FY2020 sales basis, the stock has a P/S multiple of 8x. This is a very low multiple considering multiples the market is giving to other growth companies and considering that LMPX tripled revenues in 2020 and is expected to grow them considerably going into 2021-2022.

\- I expect revenues to at least double in 2021 and the stock to peak at a 15x P/Sales multiple. This implies a price target of $100 by year end 2021. Having said that, I aim to take profits in 90-100$ price range.

&#x200B;

Positions/disclosure:

I am long 150 shares bought in at an average price of $27.5 and I am looking to add to the position once the price starts to indicate more upward momentum.

&#x200B;

**TLDR - Long LMPX, current price $27, YE 2021 price target at $100.**

It should go even higher.**

For the 8 of you still reading, I present to you a somewhat neglected stock hurt by Covid that hasn't fully recovered, but also one whose February high of $60 is not a ceiling.

Yes, Coca Cola has had a decent run from it's $36 March lows and is even up 12% since October, trading about $54/share as of Friday before pulling back a bit this morning.  It's not done yet.  Let me provide a few reasons why.

To understand where we're going, let's look at where we've been. Here's a 5 year chart.

&#x200B;

[5 year performance of KO: courtesy of CNBC](https://preview.redd.it/4lmb773xnl361.png?width=1538&format=png&auto=webp&s=8e426700a92d40cd64e6d58994cb5f330a9b8658)

The stock has been of a bit of a snoozer until it began to awake from its slumber about 2018, which accelerated through 2019 and then Wall Street really started to like it in 2020.  It had upward momentum, upset by Covid.  This momentum will return, very soon.

**Catalyst:  In Person Dining**

Why will momentum return?  Most importantly, vaccines will return restaurants back to normal operations by summer 2021. The restaurant industry has been in total carnage.  Independent restaurants are closing permanently every day, with large chains taking market share.  BUT - those that are still operating are living off of Off-Premise consumption.  IF people get drinks to go, they get one.  No refills.  This has depressed an entire major sector of Coke's sales.  As restaurants return to normal, they'll have more customers, and existing customers will be consuming more cokes per sale than they are now.  That's a double re-open win.

**Catalyst: Cutting overhead like a mo-fo**

There's more to this story.  Coke has used Covid as an opportunity to cut costs and streamline operations.  They've cut employees and overhead expense - [more than 1/3 of their North American employees](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2020/08/28/coca-cola-says-layoffs-buyouts-likely-part-restructuring/5654218002/).  They've cut a lot of niche product that had overhead burden and marketing/distribution expense but had little revenue, much less profit, [like Tab.](https://www.beveragedaily.com/Article/2020/10/19/Coca-Cola-discontinues-TaB-diet-soda-in-the-US)

They're going to come out of this a leaner, more focused company.  They may still have an old and sleepy brand image, but they're also a cash printing machine, and they're going to be printing even more tendies to share with us.

**Catalyst: Falling Dollar**

But wait! There's more!

Coca Cola generates [roughly one third of its revenue from North America](https://www.statista.com/statistics/271136/coca-colas-revenue-distribution-worldwide-by-operating-segment/).  That leaves the balance subject to currency fluctuations.  With the dollar tanking, [those foreign profits are going to be worth even more.](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/economics/09/how-us-benefits-when-dollar-falls.asp)

**Not Priced In**

Looking at the [CNBC.com](https://CNBC.com) earnings helps demonstrate that the street has not priced in the recovery, much less the benefits from restructuring and currency.  The company itself has not been providing guidance as they have no more visibility than we do how the almost random shutdown/reopen orders will happen.  They did, however, [warn that Q3 would be hampered by currency exchange rates when the dollar was strengthening](https://www.barrons.com/articles/coca-cola-stock-is-rising-after-earnings-heres-why-51595335348), the opposite of what is happening now and projected to continue for a bit.  How did Q3 end up when the currency was facing headwinds?  They beat the street consensus by 18.8%, and were just one cent per share less than a year ago - when unemployment was at a record low and everything was "normal".

&#x200B;

[Coke's Earnings Trend - CNBC](https://preview.redd.it/34xwla91jm361.png?width=1326&format=png&auto=webp&s=15d64af9e6559ac5d1bb1e8bf1cc76f77e8f219b)

Based on the same CNBC data, the street is projecting that one year from now, after restaurants are fully operational, after the company has completed a worldwide restructuring that will eliminate 1/3 of its North American employees, and after the benefit of a presumed lower dollar, the company will just be earning 3 cents more in Q3 and Q4 2021 than it did in 2019, pre-covid.  Again, this would say that reopening their fountain sales division to normal levels is only worth 4 cents per share from this past quarter when much of the country remains shut down.  That seems low.  Too low.

**Benchmark: Starbucks**

What's the upside here?  I'm using Starbucks as the benchmark.  They're both beverage companies, though Starbucks is clearly more of a direct restaurant play, and more of a pure play on China's reopening - which is far ahead of the US's and the rest of the world's economy.

&#x200B;

[Starbucks One Year Performance - CNBC](https://preview.redd.it/ifebi0x2tl361.png?width=1562&format=png&auto=webp&s=606fe19138dfcfc86ff139b105225bc1b2dab23b)

Starbucks hit a high of about 93 in January, as Covid was already gripping China.  It then fell and rebounded to about $90 in February before beginning the March market swoon.  On the way back up it kept bouncing into that $90 level (frustrating the hell out of me holding $90 calls) before finally breaking through on the way to all time highs, now at $102, almost 10% above the January highs.

Looking at a similar pattern (though KO held on longer before a much quicker descent) I would expect KO to test $60 soon, and probably bounce off a time or two before breaking through.  Again, based on prior momentum I would expect once it clears $60 it should easily run up another 10%.  The market will quickly recognize when they reopen they're going to have more operating leverage than when the shutdown began, and they're going to start seeing currency gains as soon as this quarter.

**Benchmark: Pepsi**

Pepsi is probably viewed as Coke's more direct competitor.  Coke had been outperforming them over the last 3 years until the Covid dip.  Pepsi, more diversified because of its snack businesses, was the better stay at home play.  Coke has a decent catch up trade remaining.

[3 year performance Coke vs Pepsi: Barchart.com](https://preview.redd.it/x6eb2dahfm361.png?width=2326&format=png&auto=webp&s=9d74d592426a18cfc7be54f10f760bc19dd8fd53)

**Strategy:**

Sugar water doesn't get stock analysts excited any more than WSB casino patrons.  For that reason, I would not be looking at any FD's.  This one needs some longer dated options.

I want to get past the next earnings on 1/28 for evidence of the currency lift to begin to show, but the country will likely still be in winter Covid shutdown mode so I'm not sure we'll get guidance then based on restaurant openings.  I'm also feeling like mid-January/February could be a bit rough after a lights-out November and a presumed Santa Claus rally at month's end.  Keep some powder dry to buy this on dips. I am.

I'm thinking there's a three-prong approach here.

For the first taste, February 55 calls.  Relatively low risk (only slightly OTM), gets us a few weeks past the next earnings date when we should at least see a currency boost, but also captures any run up as the market starts to figure out there's still reopening meat left here to take off the bone.

I'm going to put the heart of the play into June 60 calls.  The country should be mostly vaccinated, restaurants should be back to near normal.  Hopefully this will be telegraphed by the April earnings call.  If this gets priced in sooner...[Vega is your friend.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k7eto7/you_trolls_are_in_desperate_need_of_understanding/)

For a stretch, going to throw the balance of the play into leaps for Jan 2022 65's.

I'm starting this position with $5K.  Because I expect a decent dip sometime Jan/Feb, will hopefully have some dry powder on the sideline to increase these positions if I've been too early on this move.  But as we've seen with many of the reopening plays, when the market decides it's time, I don't want to be late....or any later than I already am.

So dollar has around 71-82% of its value from year ago.

That would put current value of SPX at 2618$-3015$ in 2019 dollars.

So if true, we are technically not at the ATH.

It would also mean, to reach same "value" of its (3380$) top from last January it would need to go to:

4121$-4760$

Also Buffet indicator (Market value to GDP) is at +70% (DOTCOM was +71%)

So probably calls before next stimulus, then UVXY, SPXS and stocks you cannot cheat or lights out (For me its uranium/graphite)

Given these are insiders not to the companies themselves but to all of the news and action that goes on in the US, I am SURE they have a major advantage while not "technically" breaking the law. 

Does anyone know if there is a good resource out there that discloses US Senator/Congressmen stock trades? It would be amazing if someone was tracking this in a more up-to-date manner - whether it be through rumor or through some sort of public record?

1. Some of you may know the initial life cycle of a stock after its IPO

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/k4ezmfwt9q361.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6e2bccafaf7b8be65602664bcfda034b5d121f55

I sat down this morning with a cup of coffee and briefly looked at NIO and Palantir stocks

And It is not always the case but something much more thought requiring and complicated

2) Basically, NIO and Palantir look like 2 distant realities

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/c4vswn8b9q361.jpg?width=1125&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d125665ae074fa251ecacf5bc455e188b39ed3e9

It did not go immediately into the main hype and It took 2 years to do so. Of course, before the end of May 2020 NIO was just a Chinese tech company with little awareness in America, being IPOed in the US, It explains such a time

But the more (time), the merrier (volatility), and the little awareness about NIO and how things are going in the company created a highly inefficient market. The stock rose from its low of about 1.20$ to 57.20$ (47.66 times of 4666%). It is a tech company, and Who doesn't love the juicy tech?

Also, there've been 2 small hypes before the main hype (as opposed to the graph above with its 1 small hype rise and the main hype rise)

(The diagonal blue line is the mean that is drawn based on the lows and highs on the graph above, the curve is the 200 EMA)

3) But Palantir is another story

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/8xgi2wdc9q361.jpg?width=1128&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4b17da2d42cb1e154779d83a5505283419a6c5cc

It started trading on 30 Sep. 2020, and It took just 1 month to start the main hype. There was no initial hype (well the kind of a rise that you can consider to be substantial, Before 30 October It just got up and down by approx. a 1 $, relative to the price before the rise of approx. 10 $)

There is a nice dip on 30 Oct and after that, there's a shallow but continuous rise before there's the dramatic rise in the price (the tendency that you can also see in NIO)

These two stocks crashed (Well, They actually just went down not substantially) right after they IPOed.

The market basically wanted to get to the dip and to trigger some selling activity just so the smartest traders can get more shares for cheap

There are 3 great dips on the trend of the main hype, in an upward channel manner in both NIO and Palantir. NIO has longer and shallower dips indicating the uncertainty and the lack of Information behind the stock. Palantir had dips ranging from a couple of hours to 2 days

The two dips before the main hype are below the mean (Which can be drawn initially before the main hype, using the low at the very beginning, further lows and highs and their support resistance channel levels, and the general upside direction, Just like in the pictures above).

This quick analysis takes the time period between when Stock IPOed and the top of the main hype.  The analysis doesn't look at what happens next after the stock reaches its hype top.

The coffee was good and the morning was nice and I hope that you can build a good strategy on the initial life cycle and behavior patterns of hype stocks.......

Well now is your chance. Hello fellow Autists. I am presenting easy money. You ever hear of Calloway Golf (ELY)?  

Its a golf sporting equipment company that designs, manufactures, markets and sells golf equipment products, more specifically clubs and balls, also including accessories such as bags, gloves, and caps. But the company has now taken a huge step and expanding the ability to create revenue and bring more recognition to their brand, and finding a new way to target new golfers. THEY ACCQUIRED TOPGOLF.

&#x200B;

[They sell equipment for golf](https://preview.redd.it/a2bzny0juo361.png?width=275&format=png&auto=webp&s=17e342d886306a04a286e90fe170538a0fb6cf1e)

Topgolf is a global sports entertainment company. It is a game that anyone can play (and win). Score points by hitting micro-chipped golf balls at giant dartboard-like targets on an outfield. The closer you get your ball to the center or 'bullseye' and the further the distance, the more points earned. Making it competitive. Meanwhile they find ways to sell you food, beer, have a bar, sell merchandise, and host parties. Plus the locations across the country and world (UK and Australia) are really cool and look like something out of a sci-fi movie at night with all the cool lights. Below I posted pictures of the location. 

&#x200B;

[TopGolf Location](https://preview.redd.it/n7tomtnlto361.png?width=300&format=png&auto=webp&s=9aa87799d68b05fad89d38e8472b44845464bbe2)

Every time I have gone to this place day or night it is packed. Making reservations on a weekend night? Better fucking do it 14 months ahead of time if you even watch a shot at securing the reservation. They have 5 hour wait times on weekend nights and is open well into the morning and still have to turn away customers The place fucking sells and it is awesome. Way better then watching your wife fuck her boyfriend on a Friday night. These places are popular and are only going to grow as it is a fairly young acquisition. It was founded in the year 2000. Highly recommend you go to a Topgolf location, even my young non boomer ass who can't swing a driver to save his life thought it was a great time. Look at the fucking pictures and tell me you wouldn't take the family or boys out for a night to get fucked up and spend 100$ rather then 500$ because your broke ass keeps buying puts on TSLA. Well by doing this play....you can finally make enough money to afford a fun night at Topgolf and just maybe...MAYBE...your wife won't fuck her boyfriend for one night and give you a chance.  

&#x200B;

**Valuation and reasoning for the run up:** Calloway is a 2.15 billion mid cap stock right now. It has been at these levels before and has retard strength momentum right now as it is trading at around 23 dollars a share. Earlier a few weeks ago it was at 16$..this has the possibility to be the next fucking meme stock for wallstreetbets but you autists won't pile into it because it seems to good to be true...but once again this will make you money rather then donating it to the wall street rich guys through TSLA puts. **The fact that it acquired Topgolf is a gamechanger. It made 1.1 billion dollars in revenue in 2019 and has grown at a 30% compound annual rate since 2017.** has made this stock (ELY) a fucking game changer. Morgan Stanley put a $30 price target on this stock in the next year. 

&#x200B;

The only negative comment regarding the TopGolf merger I've seen is that ELY paid too much for the company, especially during a pandemic. This view is very shortsighted because back in 2017 ELY valued their 14% stake in TopGolf at a $2.1Billion valuation, which is before the company had 3 years of 30%/year growth. Other than the weak overvaluation argument, the analysts are unanimous in calling the TopGolf deal transformational to ELY and expect the company to deliver strong growth for many, many years. A vaccine or treatment for the virus should arriving soon, which would make the TopGolf deal suddenly undervalued again and send ELY shares to new highs. TopGolf is currently in hypergrowth mode, especially with their Top Tracer business which is only 1% penetrated worldwide. I listened to the merger conference call and it was obvious that the ELY CEO was being overly conservative in his projections, it sounded like the EBITDA projections he was giving was the bare minimum that the combined business will achieve. Definitely and under promise, over deliver scenario here. 

TopGolf rakes in money. Now Callaway equipment will be in front of everyone that walks through those doors. I understand the dilution worries but they acquired TopGolf for an incredible price. Looking long term this is a great acquisition to help them broaden their footprint.

If you can't tell already, I am referring to the hoards of Stripe/PSTH conjecture. The truth is, Ackman would love to acquire a minority stake in Stripe–and so would I, along with everyone else in the world who loves the color green. Hold on one second...

PSA: I am not taking Stripe Public

Anyway, regardless of what your astrological signs say about a PSTH deal, ***no compelling case exists for Stripe to even rush to become public*** for a number of reasons:

* It has no shortage of private investor interest because it's disrupting the global e-payments industry
* In the words of John Collison, Stripe's "still growing at startup-like rates and investing at startup-like rates." John even said he thinks they will be "continuing to operate in that mode for a few YEARS"
* Being listed would burden the company given the reporting requirements, transition, additional regulations, and would distract from Stripe's long-term vision
* John Literally Said 👏We 👏Have 👏No 👏Plan 👏To 👏IPO (and if you think that leaves a SPAC merger on the table, read this article [https://www.independent.ie/business/stripe-co-founder-john-collisonis-bullishon-post-brexit-uk-andsays-no-ipo-or-banking-planned-39818524.html](https://www.independent.ie/business/stripe-co-founder-john-collisonis-bullishon-post-brexit-uk-andsays-no-ipo-or-banking-planned-39818524.html))

Ultimately, Stripe will go public. But not now, not with PSTH's $5B, and not in Ackman's specified timeframe. By the way, John Collison mocked PSTH on Twitter. Don't pester people. ([https://twitter.com/collision/status/1326640110373367811](https://twitter.com/collision/status/1326640110373367811))

If PSTH and my call options tank because the Collisons formally reject all this "SPAC-ulation" I'll be disappointed to say the least. Be patient.

In Bill We Trust, Amen.

TLDR: $TRIT 15C 12/18 and $TRIT 17.5C 1/15_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ ATSG - a sneaky play on AMZN ATSG - Air Transport Supply Group.  An under the radar play on Amazon and likely an acquisition target. Stick with me here:

ATSG subsidiary Air Transport International will fly the six Boeing 767 converted freighters under a preexisting contract with Amazon to provide crew, maintenance and insurance. Amazon is leasing the planes for 10 years from another ATSG company, Cargo Aircraft Management (CAM), part of a deal this summer for 12 aircraft. 

The first leased freighter began operating under the Amazon banner in May, with the remainder scheduled to start work next year.

With the new flight award, ATSG projects that its airlines will operate 38 767s for Amazon Air by April 2021, 36 of which CAM leases to Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN).

In exchange for the commitment for 12 more leases, Amazon will receive 7 million warrants to purchase ATSG stock, increasing its potential ownership stake to 38%. If Amazon leases five more aircraft under the 2018 deal, its equity stake in ATSG could reach 40% — double the investment rights granted in the initial 2016 partnership. So far, Amazon has not exercised any of the warrants granted by Wilmington, Ohio-based ATSG.

I believe this is a strategic acquisition target for AMZN, as they have made a strong push into their own delivery and owning the process end to end. From delivery to the distribution centers to delivery to the customer. 

https://cheddar.com/media/amazon-replacing-usps-with-own-delivery-network

Based on their growth with ATSG and their potential 40% ownership stake - it is a logical progression and one I’m betting on.

ATSG is a leading provider of aircraft leasing and air cargo transportation and related services to domestic and foreign air carriers and other companies that outsource their air cargo lift requirements. ATSG, through its leasing and airline subsidiaries, is the world's largest owner and operator of converted Boeing 767 freighter aircraft. Through its principal subsidiaries, including three airlines with separate and distinct U.S. FAA Part 121 Air Carrier certificates, ATSG provides aircraft leasing, air cargo lift, passenger ACMI and charter services, aircraft maintenance services and airport ground services. ATSG's subsidiaries include ABX Air, Inc.; Airborne Global Solutions, Inc.; Airborne Maintenance and Engineering Services, Inc., including its subsidiary, Pemco World Air Services, Inc.; Air Transport International, Inc.; Cargo Aircraft Management, Inc.; and Omni Air International, LLC.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/i6jc7j/coverage\_on\_splk/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/i6jc7j/coverage_on_splk/)

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/i9wrpv/coverage\_on\_splk\_part\_2/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/i9wrpv/coverage_on_splk_part_2/)

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/iea6hk/estc\_and\_splk\_earnings\_next\_week\_826\_amc\_saas/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/iea6hk/estc_and_splk_earnings_next_week_826_amc_saas/)

Although ESTC doesn't compete directly with SPLK, certain market segments do overlap. Analyzing the SPLK tech stack, their moat is not in visualization nor data interface, but it's in making huge amount of data easily searchable and able to be aggregated, something ESTC does better.

On post Q2 earnings, the analysts were saying

[https://www.yahoo.com/news/splunk-slips-pre-market-revenue-095557873.html](https://www.yahoo.com/news/splunk-slips-pre-market-revenue-095557873.html)

>“While optically it may seem as if SPLK missed its revenue target, cloud ARR is heading in the right direction which is the important metric investors should focus on,” Eyal wrote in a note to investors. “We expect SPLK to maintain a strong pace of revenue growth for some time to come, driven by growth in its cloud business, and we believe the company should be able to expand margins through operating leverage and efficiency gains"

My thought on this was

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/iijc4h/coverage\_on\_splk\_part\_iv\_aftermath/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/iijc4h/coverage_on_splk_part_iv_aftermath/)

>"Bullshit, they paint it as if nobody can sell software anymore except as a cloud SaaS, this is definitely not the case. Look at ESTC, non cloud rev still growing along with top-line"

Then when Q3 results came in, everybody was acting surprised with some even filing lawsuits against SPLK

[https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/12/03/why-splunk-stock-was-slammed-on-thursday/](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/12/03/why-splunk-stock-was-slammed-on-thursday/)

>"Splunk's Q3 results and management's guidance for Q4 were both well below analysts' expectations. Revenue came in at $559 million, down 11% year over year. On average, analysts were expecting revenue of $613 million. Splunk also reported an adjusted loss per share of $1.26 -- far behind the $0.09 per share in profit analysts had been modeling for."

[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/shareholder-alert-splunk-inc-investigated-152200094.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/shareholder-alert-splunk-inc-investigated-152200094.html)

>"JPMorgan, who was “blindsided by the magnitude of too many large deals slipping in the final days of October.” Shares are presently down approximately 25% from their December 2, 2020 closing price, representing billions of dollars in lost market capitalization."

Why they all act surprised when Q3's results continues Q2 's trend and the stock plummeted 25% is beyond me. I'm guessing since SPLK is such a fund darling, they were stalling until they can divest enough to the retail crowd and state pension funds before revising the price target.

My main gripes with all the sell side analyst covering SaaS cloud companies, is that they always take a braindead cookie cutter MBA analysis of the company, just focusing on ARR and RPO without taking into consideration the Tech/operational side of the product. However for SPLK case, it was pretty obvious even from  Q2's financial results that their cloud ARR growth, which cost them a lot more compared to traditional licenses, won't make up for the declining on-prem license revenues

https://preview.redd.it/wc19qrxoho361.jpg?width=591&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c3ede9b4d9ef04da261f8080cae8b35bff026417

In Contrast to ESTC, which recorded revenue rise across the board even in traditional on-prem license revenue

https://preview.redd.it/uf7wkczpho361.jpg?width=593&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e34b9c463d736a301f574c55c3648215b20a24ea

From an IT management perspective, for a CIO/CSO, ESTC have made it possible for literally almost anybody to implement SPLK-like functionality in their IT-OPS environment. Rather then buying expensive SPLK cloud or on prem license,just use ESTC opensource or buy the basic license, and have either someguy in bangalore or poland to implement the visualization and data interface for 150 bucks a day.

An ESTC base license + 40 man days at cheap outsourcing rate, you'll get a solution 2x as flexible as SPLK at 10 percent of SPLK's TCO.

# GME Short Squeeze to 19+ Before Falling of a Cliff for Earrings?

GME has been in a rounding bottom since 11/30 and is 2/3 the way complete. The rounding bottom is a consolidation pattern.

It appears that a hidden bear wedge is forming - this could indicate downward projection.

If GME makes it up to the 18.30 - 19.30 range, expect a top and downtrend to appear. Perhaps just in time for earnings cliff dive?

Be mindful of a position fake out and GME to begin forming a cup and handle - bullish pattern.

Recommended Positions:

HEDGE:

* 17c 12/11 exp and 17p 12/11 exp.
* If GME passes 17.44 with volume, play 17.5c 12/11 and trim around 18-19.30 area.
* If GME falls below 16.5 with momentum, play 16.5p 12/11 exp.
* And take profit at around 16-15.12 range.

# THE NIGHTMAN COMETH ONE LAST TIME to TALK ABOUT NIO

Possible long squeeze happening with NIO due to china delisting fears. IMO. They won't get delisted.

&#x200B;

Last "Thursday, an analyst gave a negative view of China's EV industry, sending NIO's stock lower by 5%. UBS issued a note on NIO rival XPeng, cutting its rating from buy to neutral based largely on the huge run-up in valuation that XPeng had seen. NIO investors seemed to take that message to heart as well."

&#x200B;

NIO is in a healthy downtrend channel and needs to hit support at around the 38.18 range to complete. It should bounce off resistance and head back to  39-40 level where it may find some resistance. If it breaks resistance at that level, anticipate NIO to climb to 41-42 range for the second resistance level. It may bounce or may exit the downtrend since the pattern will technically be complete. If it jumps out expect a  PT of 42-45 within 3-4 days of the breakout.

If NIO fails to break the first resistance level at 39-4o level, anticipate it to drop to the 38-36 range.

&#x200B;

NiO shouldn't go lower than 30. 30 PT is a danger zone. We are getting near the bottom so be mindful of your indicators and oscillators.

&#x200B;

[30m timeframe](https://preview.redd.it/s7cpzcgahq361.png?width=2446&format=png&auto=webp&s=040a9fc3cedd1d6bcd13771a50970e1c60b96e08)

# Suggested plays for NIO:

&#x200B;

* HEDGE: 42c 12/11, 42p 12/11
* If NIO breaks 44.28 resistance, convincingly, play a 44c 12/11 exp and trim or take profit at 45.11 - 51.93 (not getting even close to 51) range.
* If NIO breaks support at 41.16, convincingly, play 40p 12/11 exp and trim or take profit at 38.18 - 29.06 range.
* I recommend you let your hedge expire worthless or you could try to sell you put at the bottom and keep your call for on the way up - this is WSB after all.
* BIG BRAIN with bullish sentiment for next week towards NIO might hedge with a 42c 12/18 exp. and 42p 12/11. If you take that strategy. Good luck friend. Diamond hands.

User commentary as replies to the messages below are encouraged. Report bugs to /u/zjz._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Why your next stock purchase better be HYLN **I MEANT CALLS FUCK**

Many of you know that the next big move in EV's is who can take the biggest share of the transportation industry. I'm not talking about your mom taking you to the nearest autism center, I'm talking about the transportation of moving your favorite fidget spinner into your Gay Bear hands.

**Why HYLN when Tesla providing trucks soon you fuck???**

Very simple answer, Tesla trucks are nice and all but they have two major limiting factors. 
1.	The truck range is only 500 miles (Hyliion's ERX is 1300 miles)
 2. CHARGING A SEMI IS NOT THE SAME AS CHARGING YOUR MODEL S E X OR Y. 

Many reports have come out that state that to charge a tesla truck, it would require revamping entire grids to support those key charging areas. Now imagine when you have to deliver something to bumfuck nowhere, aint gonna be no efficient chargers. The technology just isn't there yet. 

https://www.greenbiz.com/article/electric-truck-fleets-will-need-lot-power-utilities-arent-planning-it

Ok, what does Hyliion do to "solve" this problem. Simple. They use natural gas. NATURAL GAS??? WHAT? Yes natural gas. There is already 700+ natural gas stations around the United States, that means that it can easily travel anywhere it needs to, and it is much easier to establish new natural gas stations than it is to revamp electrical grids for tesla chargers, (think of how long its taking to fix flint's water) 

Additionally, it uses an onboard generator under the hood so that when you are driving, IT IS ALSO CHARGING THE BATTERY, this means that the range of a hyliion ERX truck is 1300 miles with an increased payload than Tesla's semi truck. You probably don't know this but many truck companies send out truck drivers in pairs, because of regulations, one drives while the other rests. With tesla trucks you can't do that since it only goes for 500 miles, they would need to stop and charge, while hyliion ERX truck will keep on going.

Also Hyliion's products are actually net negative carbon emissions. HOW? When cows fart, they give off methane (a pollutant), which is used to create natural gas. As our population grows, more meat eaters, more cows, more methane. Natural gas takes methane out the air and powers shit. Hyliion uses natural gas, that means using hyliion products not only produce clean efficient energy, you are also rapidly removing methane out of the air, a net negative carbon emission.

Now their current amazing product that Hyliion produces is that they  convert the rear axle of EXISITING TRUCKS to electric. Many companies do not want to do the jump in EV because they have already spent millions on their existing trucks. Well that whole market is up for grabs for hyliion because their product will give those existing trucks a 10-30% fuel cost reduction and will give them more torque and power so that when they go up hill, they have a much easier time than now. Additionally they use algorithms to help the driver get the most efficient drive possible and gives them points, think of a mini game for those truckers. 


**Yo autismo, I just saw their stock and it dipped massively recently, what happened???**

Hyliion on November 30th announced that they will redeem their public warrants. Now some people can say that's bad, others say that they are using that extra ~~144 million that they will receive to finish up their infrastructure etc. Either way, do you want to buy on a day its up 50% or do you wanna buy when the stock is red???

NOW IS AN AMAZING OPPORTUNITY TO BUY THE STOCK FOR LOW PRICES.

The stock had a 20-40% short ratio against it in the past week, and it refused to break the $18 support level. It is itching to go up from here once the news of the warrants are settled. 

I am in at 100 shares and buying 600 more in the upcoming days NEXT YEAR DATED CALLS

TLDR: YOUR NEXT STOCK PURCHASE BETTER BE HYLIION DO NOT MESS UP ON THE NEXT TESLA TRAIN. BUYBUYBUY

(I LOVE TESLA AS MUCH AS THE NEXT BULL BUT HYLIION TAKES THE TRUCKING INDUSTRY)

*P.S. I AM NOT AN EXPERT, BUT I BELIEVE IN THIS STOCK*_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ “Don’t make major financial investment decisions off of a single comment you read on Reddit.” 😂 _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Buy the close & sell the next open...how do we feel? _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ UPDATE: stonks / wsb_portfolio.csv 2.0: free market edition (see thread for changelog).

* More filter options, including external linking to different financial websites (RH included).
* Sentiment scores for each post, with emoji indicators using weighted sentiment score for each ticker.
* Improved ticker parsing. Instead of trying to parse as many tickers as possible from OP’s, it determines the primary ticker for each OP instead. In other words, each post is associated with one ticker now. And instead of “ticker mentions” it uses upvotes for (fake) shares. If you’re reading this and you plan on writing up a DD or sth in the future, putting “ticker: \[ticker name\]” in your post somewhere will automatically qualify the post for that ticker.
* New set of columns —> shares, average cost, current price, total return. That’s right, I was able to get the approximate price of each post by using the price of the ticker at open/close (whatever was closer to the posts timestamp). See site footer for details on how each column is calculated.
* Open-source. Repo’s been made public and a github link’s been included for anyone wanting to contribute.

Those are all the major ones I can think of. Thank you all for the feedback last week, I won’t be doing any more major updates, it’s totally up to the community now to take it from here._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Why my oil calls are kill _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ buy the fuck out of UPS listen boys, I work as a truck loader in my local UPS warehouse. its a pretty big one, probably top 40% in size, amount of employees, and volume of all of their warehouses. the warehouse has 4 centers. the center I work in has about 20-25 preloaders on shift per day. each preloaders loads 4 trucks. in my warehouse, the expected volume each preloader is supposed to handle is somewhere around 180 packages per hour. over a standard 5 hour shift, that's about 900 packages. 

me and every one of the other loaders in my center handle about 1500 per day.
