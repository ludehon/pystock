 My Watchlist For 1/6/2021 **\*\*I trade off of the 180D/4H chart. I use the RSI, Stochastic, Vortex, and 10-50-200 EMA Lines as well\*\***

&#x200B;

$BGS - Beautiful channel going on. Extra strong support area, it may dip lower so be prepared for that. RSI over sold, and Vortex has never been lower. 

&#x200B;

$DRE - Has room to drop to $38 but this 200EMA bounce is strong; and an area of support. Higher lows is a great sign. Stoch is super low and so is Vortex.

&#x200B;

$EBR - Has a tiny bit more room to drop, but 200EMA, support, and channel? Love it. All 3 indicators are oversold, time for a reversal.

&#x200B;

$ED - I mean.... what a channel to play off of. What a great value at $69. Stoch super low, RSI is fair price.

&#x200B;

$KNDI - More risk; I want to see life first. But strong support and channel area to play off of here. All indicators are consolidating.

&#x200B;

$KREF - Fantastic area of value, stochastic divergence, and RSI is over sold. The price action alone is enough to buy in, but the indicators are just icing on the cake.

&#x200B;

$MORF - Resistance retest as a support now, can dip to the 200EMA line still. RSI is fair, and Stoch is super low. May have another day or 2 of selling off.

&#x200B;

$NSA - Fantastic. 200EMA, Support, and a channel altogether here. All 3 indicators are low, this should be a great reversal. 

&#x200B;

$OPTT - Reversing above the area I would like to see, but if it holds go long. Massive potential, more risk than usual. RSI is fair, But Vortex is low and has room to run.

&#x200B;

$PEAK - 200EMA and support are here. Could drop to $28 still. All indicators are oversold, but if it lives we are at the ground floor of a new channel.

&#x200B;

$PEG - Great channel up, this areas has support and trendline. All indicators are low so we should see a reversal soon.

&#x200B;

$WYY - Strong support, strong trend, possible flag here? Massive move possibility. More risk than I like though.

Optimization So we all know that time in the market beats timing the market. This is what makes "buying the dip" a worse performer than DCA: missing out on the big gains made while forever waiting for the next dip.

But what if you lower your "dip" expectations in order to trigger at least \~1 monthly dip? The goal is to invest monthly, as with DCA, but not at a random price. Pro: prevent buying overpriced/all-time highs. Con: stay out of the market a few more days.

There can be many strategies to identify this dip. Personally, after the paycheck I make my one monthly buy&hold at the 1st occurrence when the price passes over the 15-day moving average, as I found this a sweet spot to trigger at least one monthly buy opportunity at "discount".

I've been doing a lot of work in the US cannabis space and 2021 is shaping up to be a big year for the cannabis industry and for Ayr Strategies (AYRWF), a US multi-state operator.

**TL;dr: The stock could be a 3-6x over the next two years and 10x+ longer-term. The US MSOs will be the most direct beneficiaries of growing cannabis consumption, and AYRWF has a strong management team, the highest growth over the next two years, best-in-class margin profile, and lowest valuation.**

*Note: the company is listed in Canada under AYR.A and is available over-the-counter under AYRWF (OTC ticker recently changed from AYRSF to AYRWF).*

**Thesis**

* Cannabis is a $80-100Bn consumer staple category but only $20Bn are legal sales. The rest of the market is illicit. In addition to seeing the overall industry grow, the US operators should see a strong tailwind from illicit sales converting to legal sales
* AYRWF is expanding its footprint in seven high-growth states including MA, PA, NJ, AZ, OH, FL, and NV (see table below)
   * Limited license dynamics gives AYRWF a buffer against new competition
   * Recent acquisitions in Florida and New Jersey give the company a strong position in two large, growing markets. Deals slated to close in 1Q21/2Q21
* Strong financial profile
   * AYRWF projected to grow \~140% in 2021 (75% organic) and 65% in 2022 (40% organic)
   * The Company has 40%+ EBITDA margins currently
* Company has a strong, sophisticated management team with a background in finance, mergers & acquisitions, and operations. They run a tight ship as evidenced by their high EBITDA margins and ability to execute through COVID-related disruptions throughout 2020
* Several industry catalysts including:
   * Adult use legalization in PA, FL, OH
   * Banking bill would allow cannabis businesses to access the banking system, reduce their cost of capital, improve their margin profiles, make customer transactions more seamless, and allow AYRWF to list on a major exchange
* Stock is significantly undervalued
   * AYRWF trading at 9.5x and 5.0x 2021 and 2022 EBITDA, respectively vs peer average of 21x 2021 and 13.5x 2022
   * For context, GRWG trading at 40x+ 2022 EBITDA

**What is the stock worth?**

* If AYRWF simply traded at the group average of 13x 2022 EBITDA, the stock would be worth $75, or a 3x from here...
* ...but what would you pay for a high-growth consumer staple business growing 40%+ organically with 40%+ EBITDA margins? 25x EBITDA ($145 target price - 6x upside)? 30x ($170)? 40x ($230 - 9x upside)? I believe the stock will get a higher valuation as we get positive news throughout 2021 and cannabis increasingly becomes a part of the mainstream
* How does the valuation gap close? Deal closures, execution, and discovery. Until recently AYRWF has been a strong but smaller player that not many people had heard of. Through a series of acquisitions (some of which have yet to close) the company will have a diversified footprint indexed to some of the best markets in the US. The company is well positioned to become a top 5 MSO by the end of 2021

**Risks**

* Recently announced deals to acquire assets in FL and NJ don't close
* Delays in implementation of adult use sales in AZ and NJ
* Execution missteps

**Overview of AYRWF's state footprint**

* PA: market estimated to grow \~60%/year from 2020-2025 (assumes adult use legalization by 2023)
   * AYRWF expanding from 1 dispensary to 6 in 2021
* MA: market estimated to grow 10.5%/year from 2020-2025.
   * MA is already an adult use state but the story here is around Boston where AYRWF recently received a license to operate a dispensary in downtown Boston. Sales to begin in 2021
* NV: market estimated to grow 12%/year from 2020-2025. NV performance through COVID shows strength of this market
   * AYR has 6 dispensaries
* NJ: market estimated to grow 80%/year from 2020-2025. Adult use sales likely to begin in 3Q21
   * AYRWF recently acquired a vertically-integrated license in NJ including 3 dispensaries
* AZ: market estimated to grow 15%/year from 2020-2025, with growth front-loaded in the next couple of years as adult use sales begin in 2Q21
   * AYRWF has 3 dispensaries currently
* FL: market estimated to grow 25-30%/year from 2020-2025 (assumes adult use legalization by 2023)
* OH: market estimated to grow 50%/year from 2020-2025 (assumes adult use legalization by 2024). Relatively nascent medical market that has surprised many jumping out to a $250MM run-rate in a little over a year

From interviews of Cathy Wood, she also said that the major reason why Tesla is undervalued is due to the potential of self-driving cars and the software that comes with it. Not necessarily EV sales.

&#x200B;

From a Quora post responding to the question,

"[**Is Tesla, Inc's stock (TSLA) undervalued right now?**](https://www.quora.com/Is-Tesla-Incs-stock-TSLA-undervalued-right-now)**"**

"As an EV manufacturer, Tesla is, by every metric, overvalued. I mean, it's valued at 9x VW, yet VW sells 14x more cars.

HOWEVER, if Musk pulls off what he claims he will - that Teslas produced from 2016 will suddenly turn into self-driving cars next year, or even if he's a year late, then Tesla begins to look undervalued.

A recent video makes all of this seem a lot more possible than some, including myself, previously thought. It shows a Model 3 self-driving from San Francisco to Los Angeles - that's over 350 miles of urban streets to highways - with almost no help.

Pretty incredible.

Tesla's USP has been EV but that was never going to be enough - as other manufacturers have been fast-joining the bandwagon.

**The real battleground is self-driving cars - whoever gets this right first will benefit from a huge first-mover advantage - huge because the gathering of real-life data first will drive home the advantage - a network effect.**

And Tesla already has hundreds of thousands of these cars collecting data.

The biggest winner in the automobile race isn't going to be the first that mass-produced EVs. It's going to be the first to win in software - like we've seen for PCs and mobiles. That may well end up being Tesla."

**One company, in particular, has had multiple underwritten offers issuing warrants with a different strike price from one another.** Not to mention a different strike price for the warrants sold on the IPO.

Only after they had their fill will the stocks actually go public on the market.

A clause in the SEC filings for the underwritten offerings states that "The shares of common stock or the pre-funded warrants, and the accompanying common warrants, **can only be purchased together in the offering** but will be issued separately and will be immediately separable upon issuance."

Long post ahead! And also my first in /r/investing so please let me know if this isn't appropriate. 

**TL;DR:** You can buy option spreads that are highly correlated to the VIX as a way to hedge, but I don't think the performance is worth it to hedge a UPRO portfolio. 

Hedging is notoriously difficult and involves the selection of the right asset class, right allocation, and right time to remove the hedge (ideally at the bottom of a correction). If the VIX were directly investable, holding it as an asset in a portfolio would provide a significant edge. However, you cannot directly “buy” the VIX, and tradable VIX products (like VXX, UVXY, etc) have notable under performance when used as a hedge. A paper by James Doran (2020) proposed that a portfolio of SPX options that is highly correlated to the VIX could be held as a long-term hedge. The portfolio buys an ITM-OTM put spread and sells an ATM-OTM call spread when the VIX is at normal values, and does not hedge when the VIX is above the mean plus one standard deviation. In this way the portfolio systematically removes the hedge when vol is the most expensive and therefore more likely to revert to the mean.

I was interested in replicating the results of this paper, extending the findings to the end of 2020 (the paper stops in 2017), and finding if the option portfolio would hedge a leveraged stock portfolio holding UPRO (3X leveraged S&P500).  

**Step 0: Obtain data, write backtest code**

Option data: I obtained end of day option prices for the SPX index from a subscription to OptionMetrics for 1996-2019. 2020 data were purchased from historicaloptiondata.com.

Extended UPRO and TMF data: These products began trading in 2009, but we definitely want to include the early 2000s dotcom crash and 2008 financial crisis in our backtests. Someone on the bogleheads forum simulated the funds going back to 1986.

Backtesting: I wrote a simple program to backtest an option portfolio in R. This program buys a 30 DTE spread as described above and typically holds to expiration. When VIX is low, a fixed percentage of the portfolio value is placed into the option portion during each rebalance, which occurs when the options expire. When VIX is high (above mean plus one standard deviation), the portfolio only holds the base asset class. If VIX transitions from low to high, the hedge is immediately abandoned, and if VIX transitions from high to low, the hedge is repurchased.

**Step 1: replicate the results of Doran (2020) with the SPX index**

To ensure our option backtest works as expected, I first replicated the results from the Doran paper using the SPX index. I allocated a fixed 5% to the hedge. I found performance was improved by using options 10% ITM or OTM, so these were used in all backtests. Below are the returns of these portfolios from 1996-2020, starting with $100,000. Although the hedge does well in negative markets, the under performance in the bull market of the last 10 years is quite apparent. The hedge also didn’t protect much against the rapid COVID crash in March 2020 – I think because VIX spiked very quickly and the portfolio wasn’t hedged for much of the crash. My results don’t exactly match those in the paper (even using a 5% spread width). I think differences in the option prices, especially early in the dataset, are playing a role in this.

[Equity curves for SPX](https://imgur.com/zme5GVb)   
SPX: un-hedged. OPT: always hedged 5%. OPTsd: hedged 5% when VIX is below the mean plus one standard deviation.

  | SPX | OPT | OPTsd
---|---|----|----
CAGR|7.49|2.91|7.08
Sharpe ratio (Annualized)|0.48|0.39|0.64
StdDev (Annualized)|15.3|7.71|11.23
Worst drawdown|52.5|35.2|41.2

**Step 2: extend the option hedge to a portfolio holding UPRO**

How does the hedge work using 3X leveraged fund UPRO? I conducted the same backtest, and found that 10% allocated to the hedge is better. This makes sense – you need something with higher volatility to balance out the extreme swings in UPRO. Hedged performance is definitely better than holding UPRO alone, which has pathetic stats over this time period. Better returns than holding SPX alone, but more variance and a equivalent Sharpe ratio. Holding the VIX as an asset is still the winner here.

[Equity curves for UPRO](https://imgur.com/4zvFWE1)  
SPX: un-hedged, UPRO: un-hedged, UPROvixsd: holding VIX as hedge when VIX is low, UPROoptsd: holding option hedge when VIX is low.

CAGR|7.49|9.71|15.1|21.6

StdDev (Annualized)|15.3|46.8|31.6|40.5
Worst drawdown|52.5|97.4|87.7|91.7

**Comparison to a UPRO/TMF portfolio**

The option-hedged portfolio needs to outperform a 55/45% UPRO/TMF portfolio for me to consider running it for real. I used portfoliovisualizer.com to easily compare these portfolios with monthly rebalancing.

[Comparison to UPRO/TMF 55/45](https://imgur.com/vCHrEkZ)

The returns with TMF have less variance than the option hedged portfolio and end up almost exactly equal at the end of this time period. However, in 1996-2008, the option portfolio definitely outperformed. Holding VIX is again the clear winner in both absolute and risk-adjusted returns, but still suffers severe drawdowns.

**Conclusions**

I don’t think holding this portfolio will provide a significant advantage compared to a UPRO/TMF portfolio. Given the limitations below and no significant advantage in the backtest, I won’t be voting with my wallet. The option hedge portfolio did provide significant advantages in the 1996-2008 period, where it outperformed all other portfolios (even the optimal 70/30 UPRO/VIX!) with a Sharpe ratio of 1.01 and max drawdown of 47% in the dotcom crash. I may paper-trade this strategy to get a feel for position sizing, slippage and fills on these spreads, though.

**Limitations: Why I won’t be hedging with this method**

1. This model assumes all transactions occur at the midpoint of the bid-ask spread and does not take into account transaction costs. While transaction costs are relatively small, SPX and XSP can have relatively wide bid-ask spreads, much wider than SPY.
2. Options can by illiquid, only purchased in fixed quantities, and difficult to adjust. Today with SPX at 3750, Buying one SPX 30d 5% ITM-OTM put spread costs $16100. Adding the call spread brings the cost down to $9340 but brings the max loss of the position to $27340! Trading on XSP brings the cost down by a factor of 10. With a 1% hedge, this method is only good for portfolios >100k. As a 5% hedge this can be used on a portfolio as small as 20k. Still, what do you do when the optimal amount of hedge is 1.5 XSP contracts?
3. It’s more complicated than simply rebalancing between UPRO and TMF, requiring more active management time.
4. The option hedge didn’t even outperform UPRO/TMF in some regards!
5. Backtests are only backward-looking and easy to overfit to your problem.

**Future directions to explore**

1. Optimal hedge amount – was not optimized scientifically, I just tried a few values and decided based on returns and Sharpe ratio.
2. Differing DTE on position opening an closing. 30 days and holding to expiration may not be optimal.
3. Selecting strikes based on Delta instead of fixed percentage ITM/OTM. This would result in different strikes selected in times of low and high vol, but probably has a minimal impact.
4. The max loss of these spreads can be quite high compared to the cost to enter the trade – maybe the hedge amount should be scaled based on the max loss of the position (with the remaining invested in the base asset or held in cash).

Questions? Other ideas to test? Let me know! I’ll also happily release returns or code (it’s not pretty) if you are interested.

A very [thought-provoking piece by Jeremy Grantham](https://www.gmo.com/americas/research-library/waiting-for-the-last-dance/) that I thought was worth of discussion on this subreddit:

> The long, long bull market since 2009 has finally matured into a fully-fledged epic bubble. Featuring extreme overvaluation, explosive price increases, frenzied issuance, and hysterically speculative investor behavior, I believe this event will be recorded as one of the great bubbles of financial history, right along with the South Sea bubble, 1929, and 2000.

Grantham still finds it very difficult to time a bubble, even when he feels certain he's looking at one right now, because it's so tough to call the top. But he sees some interesting characteristics:

> Either way, the market is now checking off all the touchy-feely characteristics of a major bubble. The most impressive features are the intensity and enthusiasm of bulls, the breadth of coverage of stocks and the market, and, above all, the rising hostility toward bears. In 1929, to be a bear was to risk physical attack and guarantee character assassination. For us, 1999 was the only experience we have had of clients reacting as if we were deliberately and maliciously depriving them of gains. In comparison, 2008 was nothing. But in the last few months the hostile tone has been rapidly ratcheting up. The irony for bears though is that it’s exactly what we want to hear. It’s a classic precursor of the ultimate break; together with stocks rising, not for their fundamentals, but simply because they are rising.

> Another more measurable feature of a late-stage bull, from the South Sea bubble to the Tech bubble of 1999, has been an acceleration3 of the final leg, which in recent cases has been over 60% in the last 21 months to the peak, a rate well over twice the normal rate of bull market ascents. This time, the U.S. indices have advanced from +69% for the S&P 500 to +100% for the Russell 2000 in just 9 months. Not bad! And there may still be more climbing to come. But it has already met this necessary test of a late-stage bubble.

And then his recommendation at the end:

> Not surprisingly, we believe it is in the overlap of these two ideas, Value and Emerging, that your relative bets should go, along with the greatest avoidance of U.S. Growth stocks that your career and business risk will allow.

I don't understand everything that goes into Grantham's piece, but he takes such a historical and experienced approach to giving context to the current stock market that I think this is worth a read for anyone who's relatively new to investing and wants to experience some battle-hardened weariness when looking at Dow 30k._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Oil breaks above $50 for the first time since February https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/05/oil-breaks-above-50-for-the-first-time-since-february.html

Interested to know people’s thoughts as I’m contemplating exposing a small % of my portfolio to this stock_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Why are $RIOT and other bitcoin mining stocks overpriced? I've spent the last week and a half researching bitcoin mining, looking at financials, purchase orders, equipment, making spreadsheets, etc.

I don't see any possible world where owning 10,000 mining units (and an order for another 25,000 to arrive by October) imputes a $1b+ valuation, especially when there will be close to 1,000,000 of these units manufactured by that time.

There is nothing proprietary about what $RIOT does -- what they do is done 1000x over across the world: Buy mining hardware and plug it in.  Is the total market cap for bitcoin mining somehow in the trillions?  If owning these units is so amazing valuable, why are the manufacturers selling them rather than using them to mine?

I'm wondering if I'm missing something here...

Happy to expand on this more if there's any interest.

**About Mining**

Bitcoin Mining is the process of buying specialized hardware (which has a hashrate), hooking it up to electricity, and getting back some amount of BTC.  The amount of BTC you get is:  **your hashrate** divided by **network hashrate** times **reward**.

Currently the reward is 1000 BTC per day.  This halves every four years, so if you're a miner, get wrecked.  But anyway, just assume it doesn't half.

Now the amount of $ rewards you get is the above equation times the price of BTC, or $USD.

So to recap:  You spend $2400 to get hardware that gives you 100 TH/s... the network hashrate is 150,000,000 TH/s, so you get 1/1,500,000 of 1,000 BTC per day (.0067 BTC), times $30,000, that's $20/day.  Pretty sweet, right?  You'll break-even in 120 days, and from then on out, it's all profit, right?

---

**Race to the bottom**

Except, here's the golden rule of bitcoin mining:  **The more profitable it is to mine, the more the network hashrate grows**.  It's that simple.  Miners collectively see it is profitable to mine, so they buy a **ton** of that hardware, and now the network hashrate will, for example, double... so you're netting $10/day instead of $20/day.

This is how it works -- miners are all competing, adding hardware when it's profitable, and driving the profit margin down to the lowest point they can tolerate, given the volatility of $BTC.

There is nothing proprietary about mining, and there are no economies of scale.  There's nothing special about any miner's hardware -- they all buy it from one of a few manufacturers (Bitmain, MicroBT, Canaan, eBang, etc).  There's nothing special about electricity -- low cost electricity is available all around the planet.

During the bull run of 2017, BTC went from $1,000 to $14,000 -- but during that same period hashrate went from 2 EH/s to 16 EH/s -- so even though $BTC exploding in value, the actual mining profit margins only increased a little bit.  By the end of 2017, the same hardware you had in Jan would now mine 1/8th the amount of BTC.  (The story got WAY worse in 2018)

From my analysis I've concluded that on average **miners can hope for 1-2x return on their hardware investment across 2 years** -- by that time, the hardware has negative profit margin.  Not bad.. but not worthy of $1b+ valuation.

Of this 1-2x, the vast majority of return comes from when the newest hardware is just released, and/or when there are spikes in $BTC that happen faster than miners can provision new hardware.

---

**The arms race**

All things being equal ($BTC, network hashrate), there is another factor that guarantees network hashrate will go up -- and that is availability of new hardware.  For $2400 you could get 20 TH/s... then a year later, 50 TH/s.

Per the golden rule of mining -- if it's more profitable to mine, network hashrate goes up.  About every year the next generation of mining hardware is released and is much more profitable, so miners **must** upgrade to it or they'll be left in the dust as the network hashrate explodes. When the dust settles, they are still getting the same amount of BTC, but have had to shell out $ for the new hardware.  Nobody wins, except the hardware manufacturers.

---

**About RIOT**

$RIOT is a publicly traded company at above $1b valuation.  They've done essentially nothing but hook up a few thousand hardware units and operated at a loss.

They sell shares constantly to raise cash to pay for their losses and ridiculous salaries.  There is nothing special about their operations -- what they do happens on a scale 1,000x over across the world:  buy mining hardware, hook it up to electricity.

Throughout 2020 they ordered $83m in equipment which will trickle in throughout 2021... (which they'll have to do more share offerings to finance as their purchase orders require payment in various months).

Meanwhile, the rest of the mining world has done exactly the same, probably to the total tune of a few $billion in orders.  The miners in china will get their equipment in greater quantities, and earlier, and at better prices (no tariffs, cheaper shipping, etc).

*If $83m purchase order for late-arriving, overpriced mining hardware (which will only amount to a tiny fraction of global hashrate) is worth $1b+ market cap... doesn't this impute a ridiculous valuation on the BTC mining industry as a whole?

---

**Litmus test**

Do you think that purchasing $50m in hardware (which will not arrive until later this year) somehow imputes a $1b valuation, when literally **$billions** of the same mining hardware were purchased by all other miners?

Do you think the manufacturers are too stupid to realize that they could be multi trillion dollar companies if they just announced they are going to mine with their hardware rather than sell it?

Do you think 1% of the network hashrate a year from now is worth $1b?  (Btw, they will not even come close to 1%... network hashrate will have gone up 2-4x by then.)

Do you think $RIOT can compete against Chinese miners that get preferred deals with manufacturers, get first dibs at newest hardware, get better deals, don't have to pay tariffs, don't have to wait for shipping, and use their precious [Guanxi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guanxi)?

Do you think that when $BTC doubles, somehow all miners will **forever** make double the returns from their hardware?

Thanks!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Why Greed is necessary in bull market You must have always heard since childhood that greed is always bad. But it isn't so. Greed by itself is not a bad thing. It's how you use greed that makes it a good or bad action. But How does this apply to investing?

When you invest your hard earned money in the stock market, you should be greedy to get maximum value out of the investment because you have put in the effort and hard work to earn that money and it is absolutely fair that you get the maximum return from that money. This won't be possible unless you're greedy. You have to be hungry for more returns. 

Often times people buy some wonderful stock and sell them pretty quickly for a little bit of profit. That stock then goes to unimaginable heights. In such a situation people justify by saying that I didn't want to be too greedy hence cashed out. But that is the wrong attitude. Unless the profit you made changed your life in any meaningful way, it is always wrong to cash out too early. It's as good as never having owned that stock. 

Bull market thrive on greed and if you're not greedy then you will never be able to take advantage of bull market. The actual bull run begins when even the most bullish people say that's its too much, market has gone too high its time to stop. 

Another perspective is when you buy a bad stock that stock punishes you relentlessly and without any mercy until you cannot take it anymore. That's because it has got your neck and it will wring it and squeeze it for its worth. So when you get hold of the neck by buying a great stock (either by research or accidentally) you also need to show no mercy to it. Squeeze it for all its worth because it would do the same to you. 

TLDR; Bull markets thrive on greediness and if you're not greedy then you will never be able to take advantage of bull markets._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Daily Advice Thread - All basic help or advice questions must be posted here.

Hello! I'm repeating my question posted earlier on r/StockMarket, as it seems this subreddit is also fairly focused on the stock exchange. I usually read wsb but the less said about that the better. 

Also I'm putting this question in its own post instead of the daily question thread in the belief that it's a complex enough situation to lead to some discussion helpful to all. I feel like TPL is in the sort of situation that resembles a coming split, but I don't know enough about anything to understand the implication of the shift from 1 share of the Trust to 1 share of the new Corporation. 

At the moment I'm sitting on a hefty amount of TPL shares. Normally, seeing TPL hit $750, I would sell all. It's close to its usual annual high before plunging again in a pattern that's been repeated for the past few years. Something about oil prices? However this year is different, in that the Refinitiv rating still says **Strong Buy**. And the newsfeed says:

*"Texas Pacific Land Trust declares expected distribution date related to corporate reorganisation M2 Communications*

*The Trustees of Texas Pacific Land Trust (NYSE:TPL) declared on Friday that pursuant to its plan to reorganise to a corporation formed under Delaware law named Texas Pacific Land Corporation (TPL Corporation), from its current structure, it will distribute all TPL Corporation common stock to sub-share certificates holders in certificates of proprietary interest of the trust on 11 January 2021 (effective date).*

*Also, the company said that before the market opening on the effective date, it will distribute all of the above mentioned shares as of such date on a pro rata, one-for-one basis as per their interests in it. The trading of sub-share certificates on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) will cease and be cancelled prior to the market opening and TPL Corporation common stock will begin trading on the NYSE on the same date under the same symbol "TPL."*

*Further, the distribution of TPL Corporation common stock will be made in book-entry form only and therefore, no action is required by sub-share certificate holders to receive shares of TPL Corporation common stock. Immediately after the distribution becomes effective, TPL Corporation will be an independent, publicly traded company and successor to all of the company's assets, employees, liabilities and obligations....*

*....Texas Pacific Land Trust is a large landowners in Texas, USA with about 880,000 acres of land and not a real estate investment trust. It was organised under a Declaration of Trust to receive and hold title to extensive tracts of land, previously the property of the Texas and Pacific Railway Company and to issue transferable Certificates of Proprietary Interest pro rata to the holders of certain debt securities of the Texas and Pacific Railway Company. The company's trustees are empowered under the Declaration of Trust to manage the lands with all the powers of an absolute owner.*"

So, does anyone know what this means exactly? Why is it worthwhile to hold onto shares until and after January 11? Is this change from a trust to a corporation affecting the availability of the stock? Are more shares being issued? I don't get it. Perhaps this is all arbitrary and I should sell now?

There are lot of phase 3 trials that get published with positive data and post those results FDA decides to approve the drug or not.

Is it safe to say that companies with positive phase 3 data where a drug offers better safety profile and has favorable results - would more often then not get approved by FDA. So if one invests after the phase 3 data is out and before the FDA approval process - isn’t that a safe investment strategy?  For example, in cases like MYOV where there is positive phase 3 data - and FDA did approve the drug, so post that data and between FDA approval is a full proof way of investment? No one can really predict the market, but despite such odds stock doesn’t necessarily change post positive phase 3 data and even at fda approval - would you usually suggest holding such stocks in those settings as they eventually will go up?

This  is my first post here. I'm new (be gentle). Thought I'd start posting  my ideas and analysis on here to get feedback and brainstorm ideas.

\#######################################################################

**Description (Data in $000s)**

AAN  is a recent spinoff of PRG that operates in the “lease-to-own” (LTO)  business, offering customers the option to acquire staple merchandise –  appliances, furniture, and electronics – over a fixed term, usually  12-14 months, with flexible terms of agreement. Its primary strategy is  to target customers with lower credit scores that are unable to secure  financing elsewhere, though this only constitutes \~28% of current  revenues, with significant potential for expansion. There is a potential  market of 100 million Americans in this segment, alone.

The  LTO business benefits from relatively stable, recurring, and  predictable cash flows provided by pools of lease agreements from prior  periods. These recurring revenue streams help insulate the business from  temporary macroeconomic disruption and are not reliant on current  period sales or conditions; 88% of AAN’s revenues were generated from  recurring streams in 2019. More importantly, for our purposes, it  increases the predictability of future earnings using past earnings as  AAN also benefits from repeat customers. The past two years have been  challenging for AAN, but the LTO business tends to perform better in  depressed economic conditions that are likely to return and persist over  the next few years. Recent revenue shrinkage shouldn’t persist over the  next few years.

A rough proxy for  normalized free cash flow is an arithmetic average that deliberately  understates the growth potential of the enterprise whilst smoothing  fluctuations in capital expenditure and other undisclosed (aggregated)  line items. The following figures have excluded the restructuring costs  incurred during the spinoff and accounted for the potentially higher tax  rates (\~30%) under the new administration.

2017H FCF: $394,623.5

2018H FCF: $338,835.4

2019H FCF: $520,150.2

**2021E FCF: $417,869.7**

I’ve  deliberately chosen to use gross capital expenditures rather than  maintenance capital expenditures to understate cash flow generation.

AAN’s  merchandise base is full of staples – appliances, furniture, etc. –  that are less susceptible to online e-commerce giants; it is likely to  operate over the long-term. In addition, it already offers same or  next-day service, delivery and return of product in the majority of its  stores. No DCF is required, however. The enterprise value sits at  \~$833,790 when all interest-bearing contractual obligations and pensions  are accounted for. This means the market is pricing the company at  \~2.11x normalized free cash flow. The company is well-financed, too,  with ready-to-use financing agreements and a conservatively capitalized  balance sheet and potential for dilution is probably restricted to  acquisitions with equity-issuance.

Let’s have rough look at comparable companies in the LTO business that have a similar product mix.

Big Lots, Inc:  7.39x FCF of $264,490

Conn’s Inc: 11.52x FCF of $366,500

Dick’s Sporting Goods: 18.85x FCF of $275,341

FirstCash Inc: 23.68x FCF of $145,138

Rent-A-Center: 7.36x of $304,183

AAN  has slightly higher FCF levels than most of these comparables and is  currently refocusing on its most profitable business segments and should  post more consistent FCF figures going forward. Based on market  interest in comparables, AAN has quite a large margin of safety in  eventually being recognised by the market for its fair value. Bad debts  are minimal ($933 for nine-months of 2020).

**Potential Risk Factors**

AAN  effectively operates in the subprime space and is subject to consumer  regulation. The biggest risk here is limitations on pricing power, but  this is already partially priced into current earnings due to the  competitive industry, itself. California recently passed the CCPA that  could raise compliance costs.

Shifting  consumer preferences are always a danger, but most of AAN’s goods are  consumer staples such as appliances and furniture, which are subject to  limited risk of being “disrupted.”

Much  has been made of recent court decisions exposing LTO businesses to the  acts, omissions, and liabilities of franchisees. This isn’t much of a  problem for AAN, though, given that it is quickly buying back its  franchisees.

The spinoff may  result in a loss of economies of scope and scale in costs. I believe  that the margin of safety is large enough to absorb any potential  effects that may materialize here.

The potential for higher taxes has been built into my FCF estimates.

The  rise of e-commerce giants is a problem. I’m not sure Bezos can – or  even wants – to disrupt the furniture and appliance leasing market,  though.

COVID-19 may pose ongoing  problems such as delays in orders and supply-chain issues. None of these  have occurred over 2020, and if they occur I believe that they can be  offset by the increase in lower credit score customers using AAN’s lease  options. There was an impairment expense for goodwill in the recent  results that is extremely conservative, in my opinion, and disguises a  net profit as a loss for the nine months of 2020.

The  electronics segment (\~20%) is most likely to be disrupted. I have  deliberately avoided considering growth in order to provide a margin of  error for disruption and other fundamentally unpredictable events.

Predicting the dividend yield is impossible at this stage.

The  emergence of buy-now-pay-later enterprises may adversely affect AAN’s  business model. It’s worth mentioning that most of these businesses –  e.g. AfterPay – operate in more discretionary consumer markets like  clothing, though. AAN and LTOs also have the advantage of formalised  collateralization of leased-goods.

**Management**

The  executive suite is being taken over by Douglas Lindsay, Steve Olsen,  and John Robinson. They’ve all been working in the LTO business for  years and have good track records. Their compensation is highly  performance-based and oriented towards long-term equity options.

**Catalyst**

The  reduction in selling pressure post-spinoff; the realisation of  closer-to-normal results masked by restructuring costs and the full  amortization of goodwill in 2020; shift to e-commerce reducing costs for  physical stores and improving returns on capital; margin of safety too  large to ignore.

I know publicly traded corps can't. But say a c-corp with 10 shareholders elects to get taxed as a pass-through s-corp.

Does this mean, the company itself doesn't get taxed. No capital gains to be taxed. And the only form of taxation will be the two sharholders personal salary income tax (and possible dividends)? Am I missing something here?

Lots of articles citing stock market bubble as P/E ratio reach level that is only surpassed by the doc com bubble, second highest ever.

But Isn’t it true that the current P/E is high due to covid-19 and in fact many companies in entire industries are reporting loss per share, such as travel, airline...etc. So isn’t it flawed to use the current P/E as assessment of market valuation. Is the P/E, specifically calculated with forward earning post covid timeframe, showing the same sky high valuation?

Or has this been done before ? If so, could someone kindly provide the link, please ?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ The US REIT market does not seem to follow family homes demand It seems to me that family homes supply is low and in high demand. Ie. If you are a real estate "retail" buyer, prices will be high and stock low.

However, shares of REITs across the board have generally been hit with some exceptions.

For example, while the market has largely recovered, VNQ and IYR are still trading below precovid levels. And as far as I can tell, if you are looking to buy a home to live in, prices have pretty much been completely stable throughout the pandemic sell off and subsequent recovery.

This tells me that REITs are not a good investment choice if you want exposure residential real estate. 

I have an alternative living lifestyle. I currently live in a hotel and have previously lived in a van. I want exposure to a home but i don't want to live in a residential home so I've been buying shares of REITs because i thought it would be good exposure to real estate. However all of my REITs have lagged the 2020 market recovery.

I realize that commercial has been hit due to covid, but shouldn't the increased residential demand have buoyed REIT performance? 

It seems like there is no residential exposure in the REIT sector. At least as far as traditional homes goes.

What's the best way to get exposure to that? Should I have bought Home Depot, AirBNB, Target, Lowes, Amazon, Whirlpool type equities instead of REITs?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ US Treasury OCC will allow US banks to use public blockchains and stablecoins as a settlement infrastructure in the US financial system Breaking major news from US Treasury OCC, the largest US banking regulator, with new guidance allowing US banks to use public blockchains and dollar stablecoins as a settlement infrastructure in the US financial system.
