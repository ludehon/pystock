Regular investing - market index or a handful of tech stocks? Hi guys, would appreciate your opinion on this. 
I have a small portfolio of individual stocks, but now with great dips/buying opportunities already past, I’m planning to do dollar cost averaging, say £200 a month for start.
Would you say it’s better to invest this to US equity index (S&P 500), or a handful of individual tech stocks that I believe in? Of course for the latter I would need to keep an eye on the market and would only be able to buy small number of shares (one Apple this month and 2 AMD next month, perhaps). 

Thanks for your thoughts._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ David Einhorn calls out Tesla 'mania,' teases new short positions, and says the tech bubble is already popping https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/david-einhorn-greenlight-capital-re-tesla-mania-tech-bubble-shorts-2020-11-1029774530

The fund's short position in Tesla weighed on its performance, as the electric-vehicle group's shares nearly doubled in value last quarter. Einhorn underscored the absurdity of retail investors piling into Tesla on the basis that it split its stock in August and seemed likely to secure a spot in the S&P 500.

"It is our view that we are now in the early stages of the bubble popping," Einhorn said on the earnings call this week. "As a result, we have shorted a basket of high-flying stocks and recent IPOs trading at excessive valuations."

RVVTF In a [**news release**](https://www.revivethera.com/2020/10/revive-therapeutics-provides-update-on-fda-phase-3-clinical-trial-for-bucillamine-in-covid-19/), [**Revive Therapeutics Ltd. (RVV:TSX.V; RVVTF:OTCMKTS)**](https://www.streetwisereports.com/pub/co/6803) provided an update on its U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) approved Phase 3 clinical study of Bucillamine in patients with mild-moderate COVID-19. The company indicated that it plans to conduct the trial at 10 locations across five U.S. states.

The firm projects that more than 200 patients will finish the trial by the end of December of this year. The company stated that the results obtained will be complied and reviewed in the interim analysis that will be instrumental in selecting the best performing Bucillamine dose arm for the remainder of the trial as well as for future expanded studies in much more severe COVID-19 cases.

The company's CEO Michael Frank commented, "We are one of a few life sciences companies evaluating an investigational drug in a Phase 3 clinical trial for COVID-19 and with the rising prevalence of cases throughout the U.S., we are confident that our targets will be achieved to support the potential FDA approval and commercialization of Bucillamine for the treatment of the virus."

The firm noted that a recent publication indicated that N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) demonstrated some potential in COVID-19 treatment. The company stated that Bucillamine has a well-established 30-year safety record in use in rheumatoid arthritis treatment and has been has been shown to be 16 times more potent as a thiol donor *in vivo* than NAC.

The company stated it plans to enroll up to 1,000 patients in total in its Phase 3 multi-center double-blind clinical trial of Bucillamine in patients with mild to moderate COVID-19. Patients in the study will be randomized to receive either 100 mg or 200 mg of Bucillamine or placebo three times per day for 14 days. The firm advised that the study's primary objective is to compare the frequency of hospitalization or death in patients with mild-moderate COVID-19 receiving Bucillamine therapy versus those receiving a placebo.

The company advised that an independent data and safety monitoring board (DSMB) will perform an interim analysis after 210 patients have been treated and followed up for 28 days after randomization. After that period, the dosage level which demonstrated the best results will be chosen and randomized at a 2:1 ratio versus placebo. The DSMB will closely monitor the data and will perform additional interim analyses after 400, 600, and 800 patients complete their respective 28-day treatments. The firm mentioned that it now projects that the first round of over 200 patients will complete the study prior to the end of December 2020.

He also said Toyota could learn from Tesla’s success with investors, and its business model, which includes revenue from electric vehicles, regulatory credits, software and renewable energy products.

But, the exec went on to compare Tesla’s business to a restaurant still promoting its recipes, while Toyota is more like a restaurant already serving a huge number of customers.

“I am hesitant to say this — Tesla’s business, if you want to use the analogy, is like that of a kitchen and a chef,” Toyoda said.

“They have not created a real business in the real world yet. They are trying to trade recipes. The chef is saying ‘Our recipe is going to become the standard of the world in the future!’ At Toyota, we have a real kitchen and a real chef too, and are creating the dishes already. There are customers, who are very picky about what they like to eat, sitting in front of us, and eating our dishes already.”

Toyoda noted that his company makes and sells a much higher volume and variety of cars than Tesla, referring to 100 million Toyota vehicles out on the road owned by individual, fleet and other customers today. Toyota expects to sell about 7.5 million vehicles during its 2021 fiscal year, which kicked off Apr. 1, 2020.

Tesla expects to sell 500,000 electric vehicles in 2020.

From what I've read it seems like they really can't, which would make it pretty unimportant that multiple states legalized recreational marijuana and pretty notable that our government is going to be divided and it may be hard to pass federal legalization.

In one sentence a TML is an institutional quality stock in a leading industry group with superior fundamentals and technicals. These are monster stocks which over the course of weeks and months increase +100% to +5,000% . These stocks are disruptors which change how we work, live, or play.

TMLs are popular with traders/investors whose methodology is based on the CANSLIM system developed by William O'Neil. He called them Model Book Stocks. Huge winners worth studying to identify common characteristics that they all share  O'Neil studied over 1000 model book stocks going back to the 1880s. Many are shown and discussed in these must read books

* How To Make Money in Stocks, William O'Neil
*  Monster Stocks: How They Set Up, Run Up, Top and Make You Money , John Boik
* The Lifecycle Trade: How to Win at Trading IPOs and Super Growth Stocks, Eric Krull, Kathy Donnelly, and Kurt Dail 

**A few Historical Examples** from William O'Neil's How To Find & Own America's Greatest Opportunities

Apple 2003  [https://imgur.com/2Egn9z5](https://imgur.com/2Egn9z5)

Netflix 2009 [https://imgur.com/BHCtJpo](https://imgur.com/BHCtJpo)

Qualcomm 1997 [https://imgur.com/oYPItOW](https://imgur.com/oYPItOW)

Yahoo 1996 [https://imgur.com/ToOxnQJ](https://imgur.com/ToOxnQJ)

**So what are the Fundamental characteristics of a TML? You want to see superior:**

* Quarterly Sales Growth > 25% YoY
* Quarterly Earnings Growth > 25% YoY
* Pre+After Tax Margins >20% Recent Quarters
* ROE >17%
* Annual Earnings Ests for the next year > 25%

And above all else you want the stock to have a great story- A new and innovative product or service  that changes how we work live or play. Not every TML will have all of these criteria, but in general their record should be outstanding with regards to most of them. The higher these values the better. Earnings and Sales growth over 100% YoY is ideal. Annual Estimates for next year over 100% would be exceptional.

TMLs are also often in the Top 20 Industry groups at the times of their runs. The TML is the leader of an overall top group which is riding the tailwinds of changing environments. Recent examples $SE $SHOP $AMZN Retail-Internet and $TSLA $NIO Electric Vehicles (Auto Manufacturers)

Additionally base liquidity is required for these stocks to be institutional quality. Dollar Volume > $30 Million is essential and most should have DV much higher than that. Accumulation by big hedge funds and mutual funds like Fidelity Contrafund are what move the markets. They won't touch a promising stock unless it has liquidity.

**Now for Technical (Price Action) Characteristics of TMLs.**

They should be:

* Above a Rising 30 Week Moving Average
* Breaking out of a Stage 1 or Stage 2 Base
* Trending above Key Moving Averages (10, 21ema, 50sma)
* Volume and Price contractions within bases
* Up/Down Vol> 1.2
* Huge gaps up on volume after Earning Beat
* And most importantly they must be showing Relative Strength, meaning they are outperforming the vast majority of stocks in the market. This. is. vital.

During corrections and overall market weakness they should be near all time highs, above their longer term moving averages.  They should be standing out like a sore thumb and yelling "Buy me".  And during Market Uptrends they should be trending above the shorter term moving averages, forming sideways price shelfs during small pullbacks and then breaking out again. Most stay above their 50 SMAs and even 21 emas for extended periods of time.

**So how to scan for them:**

Use MarketSmith, the IBD Stock Screener, Finviz, or another screener and screen for the fundamental criteria mentioned above combined with the stock over the 200+50 SMA.  It's helpful to have multiple screens splitting up the criteria for instance one scan for the earnings and one for sales.

I saw RKT being discussed quite a lot on r/stocks  and most of the threads I read were bullish on it.

1.  COVID-19 crisis prodded the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates to 0
2.  RKT is nation's largest mortgage originator 
3. Their app allows customers to get everything done on cellphone so more attractive to younger generation . 
4. No  loan officer involved so less cost.

All these factors make this stock appealing and yet  its performance has not been so impressive ever since IPO. I'm not from US nor am I fammiliar with US mortgage market ,  let alone use RKT's service , so there must be something I overlook  or misunderstand.

It's top stock holding is NIO at 13%. It complements an American green energy ETF like QCLN or ICLN, which tend to contain TSLA as a top holding and then more American solar companies and renewable companies. 

It's probably a good idea to either look at its holdings for ideas for individual stocks to study, or to simply just buy and ride its gains if you're not interested in individual stock picking.  Its top non-stock holding right now is "Cash", which means it's in a position to invest and increase returns that have already been really good lately. 

Downsides: Chinese ETFs can be more volatile than US markets and even great stocks can sag for stretches for no apparent reason, in-between big leaps up that will catch you by surprise. But this is true of individual Chinese growth stocks like NIO, as well. 

Upsides: A lot of the companies listed aren't able to be directly purchased by Westerners as they aren't listed on US or Euro exchanges. That means that it's harder for them to tank quickly due to crazy stuff happening in our stock markets. So they have less exposure to downside mini-crashes over the past year. 

For all of the above reasons, it can significantly outperform US stocks in a run-up of solar/renewable/EV stocks as we saw this week. [Here is a chart of KGRN vs QCLN, ICLN and TAN](https://imgur.com/CEqom7o) (top-performing green ETFs for US stocks).

# **After sharp bounce, market may take a ‘breather’ on lingering election uncertainty, virus outbreak  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/06/after-sharp-bounce-market-may-take-a-breather-on-lingering-election-uncertainty-virus-outbreak.html)**
*****
> After an initially exuberant election reaction, stocks may trade more cautiously in the week ahead, as investors watch election developments unfold and track the course of the coronavirus. 
*****
> The S&P 500 was up more than 7.3% in the past week, at 3,509, and the Nasdaq rose 9%, the best weekly performance since April. Stocks slid Friday, but technology, communications services, health care and discretionary stocks had the biggest gains for the week, after it appeared Democrat Joe Biden could be the next president but with a split Congress.
*****
> The election was still unresolved heading into the weekend, but even if Biden is declared winner, close votes and lawsuits are likely to result in recounts. The Senate appeared to be in Republican hands, but the margin of control is likely to be tight, and runoff elections are required for two Senate seats in Georgia in early January.
*****
> “I think the uncertainty is going to catch up the market on a short-term basis,” said Leo Grohowski, BNY Mellon’s Wealth Management chief investment officer. “Perhaps next week could be a drifting lower kind of week.”
*****
> Ahead of the election, the market had been betting on a “blue wave,” where Biden would take the White House and Democrats would get control of the Senate, giving them total control of Congress. But when it appeared the Senate would stay in Republican hands, stocks surged on the idea of gridlock, which would keep Biden from implementing tax increases and lots of new regulations.
*****
> At the same time, there has been a surge in daily new coronavirus cases to more than 122,000. Economists are concerned that the economic recovery could suffer as some states could restrict activities and consumers may pull back heading into the important holiday season.
*****
> The Fed, in its post-meeting statement Thursday, repeated that the course of the virus could help determine the path of the economy.
*****
> There are a few economic reports in the week ahead, including consumer price index inflation data Thursday and the producer price index Friday. More than a dozen Fed officials are on the speaking circuit, including Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, who speaks Thursday on central banking at a European Central Bank forum.
*****
> The earnings season is beginning to slow down, but there are still dozens of reports, including from McDonald’s on Monday and Walt Disney, Applied Materials and Cisco on Thursday.
*****
> “I think next week is just setting up to be a breather. There’s still a lot to figure out here,” said Grohowski. “The equity market’s reaction has been I think understandable and probably better than many might have expected.”
*****
> Grohowski said there may be uncertainty for awhile. “What I’m thinking about is the Senate races. Part of the market reaction has been relying on this divided government.” After the votes are all in or recounted, “a sweep is unlikely but possible.”
*****
> “I think the longer this stays uncertain and messy, the more the post-election bounce comes into question,” he said.
*****
> # Different than 2000
> It would not be unusual for the stock market to sell off before rallying into year end, according to Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. Stovall does not expect the type of turbulence there was in 2000, when former Vice President Al Gore lost to George W. Bush in a tight race that ultimately went to the Supreme Court.
*****
> “In 2000, they were not expecting hanging chads. But they do expect a contested election this time. I think in many ways the market anticipated this,” said Stovall.
*****
> But the market, after its election week surge, could pull back. “Historically, the market goes down in the month of November, after a Democratic victory,” said Stovall. Since World War II, Democrats won the White House nine times, and the market fell an average of 0.5% in November in those years, compared to the average gain for all Novembers of 1.4%, he said.
*****
> After those Democratic victories, stocks then rose 1.9% in December on average, more than the normal 1.5% gain for all Decembers.
*****
> Strategists said they currently do not expect the kind of lockdowns that states ordered when the pandemic started to spread in March. But there could still be some impact that could be negative for stocks.
*****
> Grohowski said he sees some signs of optimism for the market. Strong data, like third quarter GDP, October’s drop in unemployment to 6.9%, and the better-than-expected earnings are all positives for the market. Another is that investors are so skeptical.
*****
> “What does still exist is a great deal of dry powder. There’s $4.3 trillion in money markets alone,” he said. “I can tell you, being in touch with investors of all shapes and sizes this week, there’s still a lot of skepticism. From a contrarian view, high cash and a lot of skepticism is a contrarian indicator.”

> # Presidential Election Anticipation Is Keeping Us Waiting

> While we all anxiously await the final count and outcome of the U.S. Presidential Election, here are some possible scenarios for 2021. Our analysis here is based on historical market performance during the most likely political alignments for next year. We ran these likely scenarios through the Almanac database software to create this graph.

> We are either going to have the fifth year of a two-term republican president or a first year of a new democratic presidency. It appears the democrats will hold the house and the republicans will hold the senate, but that is not a forgone conclusion either. So we also examined both presidential outcomes with a democratic, republican and split congress.

> Our study uses the S&P 500 from 1949 to 2017. We start in 1949 because it is the first full 4-Year Presidential Stock Market Cycle since the end of WWII. The Twenty-Second Amendment that implemented presidential term limits for a max of two terms or eight years was ratified on February 27, 1951. Truman in 1949 was excluded as there was a no change of party in the White House. We gave Bush 41 the same treatment.

> Admittedly, there are limited data points; four each of fifth year republicans and first year democrats. Here’s what we found. A change in party with a new, first year democratic president came with democratic control of Congress and significantly higher performance for the S&P 500, averaging 10.6% with a median gain of 15.1% versus 7.0% for the average post-election year since 1949.

> Fifth year republican presidents in 1957 (Eisenhower) and 1973 (Nixon) had to work with democratically controlled Congresses and the market suffered significant losses. The market did well in Reagan’s fifth year with a split Congress – a testament to how “The Great Communicator” was able to work across the aisle with then Speaker of the House Tip O’Neill. Even with republican control of Congress under Bush 43’s fifth year, the market had a tough year with ongoing issues in Iraq, North Korea declaring it’s a nuclear power and the most active and second costliest hurricane season on record.

> # Job Growth Continues as COVID-19 Cases Rise

> The US labor market shrugged off election uncertainty and continued to add jobs in October. Despite the waning effects of fiscal stimulus and rising COVID-19 cases, per the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, the US economy added 638,000 jobs, ahead of Bloomberg survey estimates calling for 580,000. The headline number was depressed by a 268,000 drop in government employment, including 147,000 temporary census workers. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate fell from 7.9% to 6.9% despite a rise in the labor force participation rate, a reversal of the dynamic we saw in September when unemployment fell while the labor force participation also declined.

> However, a troubling trend remains beneath the surface. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the number of long-term unemployed—those out of work for 27 weeks or longer—continues to rise as a share of the total unemployed:

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Blog-chart-11.6.20.png?ssl=1))**

> “While the labor market has continued to show improvement, there are still many people out there who are having a hard time getting back to work,” noted LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “With total jobs in the US around 10 million below pre-pandemic levels and rising COVID-19 cases, there’s a lot of room for improvement despite the declining unemployment rate.”

> COVID-19 cases in the United States have reached record highs with a weekly trend growth rate above 20%, according to the COVID Tracking Project. As the weather cools and more activity shifts indoors, additional restrictions to limit the spread of the virus could slow the fragile labor market recovery.

> In particular, much of the private sector gains in this month’s jobs report were in the services sector, where previous jobs reports had shown strength in goods-oriented industries. Many countries in Europe have reinstated restrictions or even gone as far as implementing new lockdowns. While we don’t expect lockdowns in the United States like we saw in March, restrictions on activity could limit future job gains.

> # One Sentiment Survey Soars While Another Sinks

> In an earlier post, we discussed how bullish sentiment in the AAII survey has been on the rise, but looking at another weekly sentiment survey from Investors Intelligence, the opposite is true. The percentage of respondents reporting as bullish fell sharply this week, 7 percentage points, down to 53.6%. While a majority are still optimistic and that reading is in the middle of its range, that was the largest weekly decline since a 7.4 percentage point decline to 41.7% in the first week of March.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/110520-II-Bull.png))**

> Meanwhile, the percentage of newsletter writers that are "looking for a correction" rose sharply to 25.8% this week following last week's over 5% decline for the S&P 500.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/110520-II-Correction.png))**

> The Investors Intelligence survey has a long history dating back to 1963, and in all weeks in that time, only 5% (174 weeks) have seen bullish sentiment fall 5 percentage points or more while the percentage of respondents looking for a correction has risen at least 5 percentage points in the same week. In the chart below, we show the average performance of the S&P 500 following these past occurrences when there has not been another in the prior 3 months. The S&P 500 has frequently been higher over the following weeks and months, but there is a slight underperformance relative to all periods since 1963 when the survey begins.

> # 2 Post-Election Charts You Need to See

> The election is over, but the questions are mounting. We don’t know who will be the next president as of Wednesday morning, but we do know that stocks tend to do well the final two months of an election year. “Once the uncertainty is over, stocks tend to rally in November and December, with November the best month of the year during an election year,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Of course, 2020 isn’t like any other year, and we still could be a ways away from who the winner will be.”

> The LPL Chart of the Day shows that the S&P 500 Index tends to do very well the final two months of the year, especially during election years.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Blog-11.4.20.png?ssl=1))**

> The modern design of the S&P 500 stock index was first launched in 1957. Performance back to 1928 incorporates the performance of predecessor index, the S&P 90

> One of the big takeaways so far from Tuesday night is that the Senate likely will stay Republican, meaning we may have a divided Congress. The chances of higher taxes and more regulation likely took a hit under this scenario. This could be a nice tailwind for stocks, as the S&P 500 historically has done quite well under a divided Congress, up more than 17% on average. Additionally, in years with a divided Congress, stocks have been higher the past 10 times, with 2020 potentially being the 11th in a row.

> # Emerging Markets Cheering a Potential Biden Win

> The US equity market has seen a massive rally in reaction to what is looking like a Biden victory over President Trump coupled with the Republican party maintianing its majority in the US Senate. None of these results are official at this point, so they are subject to change, but these are the most likely scenarios as of now. Outside of the US, emerging markets have also rallied. In just the last two days, the MSCI Emerging Market ETF (EEM) has rallied 5% and broken above resistance to new 52-week highs. If for no other reason then Biden's campaign slogan isn't America First, the rationale behind the rally makes some sense.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/110520-EEM-Now.png))**

> The reaction of EEM in the aftermath of this election is very much different from what happened in 2016. Heading into the 2016 election, EEM had been trending higher, but pulled back in the days leading up to the election and broke its uptrend that had been in place since earlier in the year. Again, Trump's America First approach was understandably viewed as a headwind to emerging market equities.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/110520-EEM-2016-labels.png))**

> While the initial reaction of EEM to Trump's election was negative, that weakness didn't last long. The chart below shows the performance of EEM in the two months before and one year after the 2016 election. The gray box represents the same period shown in the chart above. Within days after breaking its uptrend after the 2016 election, EEM bounced back, rallied to its 50-DMA, tested its November low, and then in the early days of 2017 it was off to the races as EEM. In fact, even accounting for the post-Election Day declines, one year after the 2016 election, EEM was up 25% which was actually more than the 21% return for the S&P 500! The moral of the story here is that first reactions aren't always the right reactions, and as an investor it's not just imperative to know the environment you are operating in, but also when the tides are turning.

> # Winners and Losers During Trump's Presidency

> With Election Day upon us, below we take a look at the biggest winners and losers across financial markets during the Trump Presidency from Election Day 2016 through today. First off, below is a chart of the market cap of the Russell 3,000 since Election Day 2000 which George W. Bush eventually won. The Russell 3,000 makes up more than 98% of the total US equity market cap, so it's a good gauge to use for measuring the overall change in market cap levels. The current market cap of the Russell 1000 is just north of $35 trillion, which is up $11.5 trillion since Election Day 2016. President Obama oversaw US market cap growth of $12.3 trillion over his two terms, while President Bush actually saw market cap decline by $4.1 trillion after his two terms.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/mktcap.png))**

> Below is a look at the total return of various asset classes since Election Day 2016 using key ETFs listed on US exchanges. The S&P 500 (SPY) is up 70.6% since Trump was elected, while the Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) more than doubled that at +144.3%. Of the broad index ETFs in the matrix, the Smallcap Value ETF (IJS) is up the least since Election Day 2016 at just +17.2%.

> Looking at US sector ETFs, the Energy sector (XLE) is a huge outlier with a decline of 48.3% since Trump was elected. Technology (XLK) and Consumer Discretionary (XLY) are up the most with gains of 154% and 97%, respectively.

> Along with Energy stocks, the oil (USO) and natural gas (UNG) ETFs have been more than cut in half since 11/8/16, while gold (GLD) is up 47% and silver is up 29.5%.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/assetclass1103.png))**

> Not every country has seen stock market gains since Trump was elected. As shown below, Mexico (EWW) is down 28.5%, Brazil (EWZ) is down 19.4%, Spain (EWP) is down 6.8%, and the UK (EWU) is just slightly in the red.

> The US (SPY) is up more than any other country with a gain of 70.6%, while China (ASHR) is up the second most at +51%. Whatever happened with the trade war certainly didn't hurt the US and China versus the rest of the world on a relative basis.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/sectors1103.png))**

> Within the Russell 1,000 in its current form, there are nine stocks that are up 1,000% or more since Election Day 2016, with Enphase Energy (ENPH) at the top with a gain of 8,590%. Trade Desk (TTD) is up the second most at +2,448%, followed by Novocure (NVCR), SolarEdge Tech (SEDG), and Quidel (QDEL). Square (SQ) ranks sixth with a gain of 1,203%. Other notables on the list of big winners since Trump was elected include Etsy (ETSY), Teladoc (TDOC), Tesla (TSLA), NVIDIA (NVDA), Atlassian (TEAM), Boston Beer (SAM), and Lululemon (LULU).

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/best-since-2016.png))**

> In terms of market cap gains for individual stocks, the numbers below are quite eye-popping. Apple (AAPL) has gained the most in market cap since Trump was elected with an increase of $1.257 trillion! Amazingly, both Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT) have added more than $1 trillion in market cap as well. Prior to the last few years, no company was even close to having a $1 trillion market cap, but at this point, AAPL, AMZN, and MSFT have gained that much in the last four years.

# DISCUSS!

What are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?

*****

I hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading week ahead r/stocks._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Just can't let it go Anyone else have that underperforming stock you just hold onto even though it doesn't do anything? For me it's Nokia (Nok). It just sits there with some small fluctuations but largely doing nothing. Perhaps I'm hoping they will get bought (again) then the investment will pay off but until then I guess I'll just hold on and watch._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Should I take gains if I plan to hold long term? Had finally my portfolio turning green😆 after months of only red! Some stocks that I plan to hold forever are up 30% (EV stocks😎). I got burned w Hyliion that I didn’t sell at 50 bc wanted to hold long term and then it dropped to 18... fortunately it’s going up again🙃

So my question is should I sell the stock that made 30% profit to lock in the profit and buy it immediately back (even though it’s a bit higher and lower) and then let it ride higher or lower, buying big dips? That way I would lock in some profit. Ofc there is the risk that the stock dips much lower and stays there and then my money is stuck, but I plan to invest long term.

Nio for example... I’m up 30-40%, but plan to hold for years. Should I do like I described? I’m sure it continues to go up in the long run. Or should I just buy the dips?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Portfolio Advise: 80% ETFs 20% Stocks. Long term Hello.

I have never invested in the market mainly due to not really understanding how it works. I invested in real estate since my early 30s. Now with a little bit of more free time on my hands, I did some research and decided it's better to invest my money somewhere instead of having it sitting in the bank at a 0.5% return.

I want to invest for the long term pumping a little bit of money into my portfolio every month from my salary (\~5-6k a month will go to my portfolio). I was thinking about the following split:

Mostly 80% ETF and 20% for active investment. I have a few questions for the kind souls:

&#x200B;

1. Is an 80% ETF 20% Stock seem like a good split
2. Should I invest in ETF with my bank or keep using IBK? If the answer is to go with my bank, what's the reason you think I should do that keeping in mind that am not a US citizen and don't have to pay taxes in my home country on any gains?
3. Is it the right time to go into ETFs? Or is there no right time if am thinking long term?
4. Is my ETF portfolio diversified enough?

Portfolio:

ETF: 80% // Stocks: 20%

ETF split out of total portfolio: VTI - 40% / VXUS 20% / QQQ 10% / ARKK 10%_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ DKNG - questions from a non American Biden's gonna win, and with his win, I foresee lockdown measures on the way; in part or in whole - hence why I'm exploring online gambling stocks.

Does anyone out there know if the new inquiry/regulations for Alipay in Shanghai  and Hong Kong could have a positive impact on Alipay having an IPO in the US? Does that make them safer in other markets?

A bit about me. I only have 2 shares of Alibaba. Not much but I purchased when it was $133 knowing they were similar to Amazon._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ What is going on with snaps stock? I'm baffled by snapchats performance this past month. It rose almost 10% today and has more than doubled in the past month yet they are almost a billion in debt? What gives? Is their stock actually worth $45 dollars? Are they still a good investment?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ NCLH Earnings Monday So I know a lot of people are optimistic on cruise lines NCLH, CCL, RCL since the big dip that they will recover with a possible vaccine(coming soon).  I know the CDC has lifted most of their restrictions but I know they wont start (possibly) until the beginning of 2021. I know that the stock market is always pricing in the future but since the haven't set sail since March, have terminated many of their employees so they wont burn as much cash, they have sold shares in order to build up more cash reserves. 

Due to all these items I think when NCLH reports on Monday I think their will be a dip, and I know after the dip and depending on what their earnings call reports lost of people are going to buy the dip since this might be the bottom with a possible vaccine coming next year summer. 

I currently have 4 puts on it and maybe I'm right maybe I'm wrong but just want to see what everyone's opinion is._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Kandi (KNDI) I was looking for some Chinese EV companies listed in the US other than the normal ones I’ve see mentioned every day. I ran across Kandi and was curious if anyone had any thoughts. Smaller EV company with only a 500 mil market cap but it looks like they are really trying to expand into the US as well as being in China. They also run a carshare program on top of producing and selling cars. 

Anyways, just seeing if it’s something to keep an eye on. Thanks!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ First time Vanguard investor. Suggestions? Total newby, sorry if any of this sounds stupid.

I'm so confused. Any help would be greatly appreciated since I've already put off investing for about 10 years so I really want to get started._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Uvxy Stock IPO?

So back in March I took a look at the market while it was completely crapping itself given the corona virus. I felt at the time (and looking back was a good feeling) that it presented an incredible opportunity to buy. I didn’t really know what to buy, but I live in Massachusetts, and I’m high (pun intended) on the legal Cannabis industry.

So with that said, I did some homework, and ended up talking a hard look at Aphria, Trulieve, and Curaleaf. When it was all said and done, I ended up taking the plunge into Curaleaf - a 1,475 position at $3.35/share. It felt to me while they had a ton of debt, their presence in multiple states, breadth of services, and regular acquisitions made the most sense for the long haul. It also felt good investing in a Massachusetts based company, given I live here. 

Flash forward to today, I’m still holding while it’s regularly breaching 52 week highs. Even this last Tuesday, 5 new states legalized cannabis in some form (medicinal or recreational), and it feels to me with the upcoming Biden presidency that real MSO (multi state operator) legal cannabis firms are going to be the place for exponential growth.

Biden has said he wants criminal justice reform in terms of cannabis offenses. The house has already passed the SAFE Banking Act and while the Senate hasn’t gotten around to it, it feels to me that given the Pandemic, states are going to be hurting for tax money and the SAFE act will enable legal Cannabis firms to grow in the form of traditional banking and liquidity, which in turn provides additional taxes through opening additional cultivation facilities and dispensaries.

So with my quick anecdote as a backstory to my post, how do you all feel about the US cannabis industry? What are some of the firms you are watching and what do you think will happen in the next 3, 5, 10 years?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Comparing the Telecom Titans: Verizon (VZ) versus AT&T (T) #**Sector and Industry**

The communication services sector has seen annual [earnings growth of 19.63%]( https://finviz.com/groups.ashx?g=sector&v=152&o=-eps5years&c=0,1,11) in the past five years. This makes the sector second only to the consumer cyclical sector in earnings growth. Notably, the consumer cyclical sector includes Yum Brands ([YUM](https://www.vhinny.com/display/YUM)), Amazon ([AMZN]( https://www.vhinny.com/display/AMZN)), and Acushnet ([GOLF](https://www.vhinny.com/display/GOLF)).

The telecommunication services industry is a subset of the broader communication services sector. Telecom companies provide communication solutions through phones, airwaves, cable infrastructure, satellites, and the Internet. The industry has seen stable earnings growth over the past five years. Telephone communication has been the largest historical source of revenue for telecom companies. However, technological advances have proven that future growth will be focused on Internet communication and mobile networks. 

Telecom services is [third in EPS growth](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx?g=industry&sg=communicationservices&v=152&o=-eps5years&c=0,1,11) for the last five years, of the communication services industries. Overall, telecom has seen steady earnings growth in recent years but still underperformed its sector.

Verizon is the largest in the industry, with a market cap of $241B compared to AT&T’s $193B. The two companies make up approximately 30% of the industry’s [$1,345B total market cap](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx?g=industry&sg=communicationservices&v=152&o=-perf52w&c=0,1,2).

#**Descriptions**

Verizon and AT&T are both titans in mobile data plans, internet service, and entertainment. AT&T has a larger exposure to entertainment through its [acquisition of Time Warner in 2018]( https://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/articles/att-vs-verizon-stock-which-is-a-better-investment). Time Warner was renamed to WarnerMedia and includes Warner Bros., Turner Broadcasting, HBO, CNN, DC Entertainment, Cinemax, Adult Swim, Cartoon Network, TBS and TNT. AT&T has famously struggled to retain customers of its DirecTV services and is currently [attempting to sell the division](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2020/10/att-loses-another-600000-tv-customers-as-it-seeks-buyer-for-directv/). 

Verizon has made the notable acquisitions of AOL and Yahoo’s internet division in the past five years. These acquisitions ended in Verizon [writing off a $4.6 billion loss in 2018](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/all/verizon-takes-4-6-billion-hit-aol-yahoo-n946486) after failed attempts to integrate the two companies. In September, Verizon [acquired Tracfone—a prepaid mobile phone provider](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/verizon-stock-buy-now/). Verizon has since moved away from entertainment and focused on preparing for the adoption of 5G technology. It is still unclear if Verizon will have a competitive edge over competitor T-Mobile in the 5G space.

#**Valuations**

Ticker|Company|Mkt Cap|P/E|PEG|Div %|Payout Ratio
:--|:--|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:
VZ|Verizon|$241B|13.24|3.82|4.29%|55.60%
T|AT&T|$194B|18.06|6.76|7.58%|103.70%

Verizon and AT&T both carry large debt loads; both are part of the top five most indebted companies. Verizon carries $139B in total debt with a current ratio of 1.10 ([read about current ratios here](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/currentratio.asp)). AT&T’s debt situation is much worse with $181B in total debt and a current ratio of 0.80. A current ratio of less than 1 indicates the Company has short-term debts greater than its total assets. 

AT&T is considered a dividend aristocrat as the Company has increased its dividend payout for 36 consecutive years. AT&T currently pays a dividend of 7.58%, with a [payout ratio of 103.70%](https://finviz.com/screener.ashx?v=152&t=T,VZ&c=0,1,2,14,15). The Company’s large debt and unsustainable payout ratio makes it fundamentally undesirable, although it is attempting to cut cash-burning operations such as DirecTV.

Verizon is not yet a dividend aristocrat, with 16 consecutive years of increased dividend payouts. Verizon’s 4.29% dividend yield at a [payout ratio of 55.60%](https://finviz.com/screener.ashx?v=152&t=T,VZ&c=0,1,2,14,15) is much more sustainable than its competitor. The lower dividend payout ratio has allowed Verizon to invest into 5G technology and pay down debt, while still growing the dividend in a sustainable way.

Fundamentally, Verizon trades at both lower P/E and PEG ratios. AT&T has seen annual EPS growth of  [8.90% the past five years, compared to Verizon’s 14.00%](https://finviz.com/screener.ashx?v=152&t=T,VZ&c=0,1,2,19). Estimated five-year growth for both companies is low, with [Verizon at 2.27% annual growth and AT&T at -1.74%](https://finviz.com/screener.ashx?v=152&t=T,VZ&c=0,1,2,20). This estimate will likely change as the impact of 5G on Verizon’s revenues becomes clear and AT&T continues [restructuring efforts](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2020/03/struggling-att-plans-tens-of-billions-in-cost-cuts-more-layoffs/).

#**Conclusion**

Positive catalysts for Verizon include the adoption of 5G and its low debt compared with AT&T. Verizon recently spent [$1.9B in bidding on 5G mmWave spectrum](https://www.businessinsider.com/how-verizon-dish-became-top-spenders-crbs-spectrum-auction-2020-9), on top of other multi-billion 5G investments. [Open signal data]( https://www.opensignal.com/reports/2020/06/usa/mobile-network-experience-5g) from mid-2020 showed Verizon’s average 5G speed beating AT&T's by as much as eight times.

AT&T would benefit from selling their DirecTV division, which would allow focus on the recently launched HBO Max streaming service. However, even selling DirecTV may not be enough for AT&T’s success in the digital streaming space due to intense competition from Disney, Netflix, Apple, and Amazon. Right now, AT&T is limited by their dividend payout ratio and debt.

In conclusion, Verizon has stronger fundamentals than AT&T and has made key investments that should serve as positive catalysts in the future. AT&T is weighed down by its dividend payment and debt making innovation difficult. Neither company offers a compelling case for growth investors and the telecom industry fits dividend investing ideals better. Those invested into either company can expect less volatility and consistent dividends but also lower gains than the total market.

Assuming Biden becomes President there a strong possibility of more stringent controls on which models of guns can be sold to the civilian population in the US.

Citing sources familiar with the matter, *Bloomberg* reports Apple, Sony and two other unnamed companies are in [discussions](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-06/apple-sony-said-to-hold-talks-about-buying-podcaster-wondery) to buy Wondery, producer of podcasts like "Bunga Bunga" and "Dr. Death." While talks are ongoing and the podcaster expects to seal a deal in the coming months, any potential bids might ultimately fall through, the people said.

According to podcast monitoring firm Podtrac, podcasts on Wondery's network draw some eight million listeners a month. The producer holds rights to a slate of content that can be remodeled for mainstream media platforms. Wonder is already using its podcast lineup to develop more than a dozen TV shows, the report said. 

The firm also has ties to Apple, with one podcast, "WeCrashed: The Rise and Fall of WeWork," [being adapted](https://appleinsider.com/articles/20/02/27/apple-developing-limited-tv-series-about-wework-debacle) for Apple TV+.

Music streaming leader Spotify, which is making an aggressive push into podcasting, is reportedly not interested in placing a bid. 

The talks come amid a concerted effort from Apple to build out its podcast offerings, including a stable of [original podcasts](https://appleinsider.com/articles/19/07/16/apple-may-fund-original-podcasts-exclusive-to-its-own-services). In May, reports indicated that the tech giant was [looking to hire](https://appleinsider.com/articles/20/05/21/apple-hunting-for-podcast-chief-to-lead-original-content-push-apple-tv-tie-ins) a content executive to develop audio spinoffs of Apple TV+ shows and original podcasts that could later be adapted to the subscription video service. 

Apple has made podcast related acquisitions in the past, including podcast search engine creator [Pop Up Archive](https://appleinsider.com/articles/17/12/05/apple-reportedly-buys-podcast-search-engine-creator-pop-up-archive) and, more recently, content curation specialist [Scout FM](https://appleinsider.com/articles/20/09/24/apple-buys-podcast-app-scout-fm-amid-increased-competition-from-spotify). It is also said to be on the hunt for [exclusive rights](https://appleinsider.com/articles/19/11/21/apple-hires-national-geographic-podcast-producer-report-says) to existing podcasts. 

Apple was a major force in establishing podcasting more than a decade ago (the term is derived from audio content made for consumption on iPod). After leaving the platform to grow organically, the iPhone maker in recent months has showed a renewed interest in the medium and is consistently updating its Podcasts app with new features.

Where should I park my money? Currently what I do is I take my Apple Cash that I accrue from my Apple Card purchases at the end of the month and I put this into my portfolio. My question is until I have steady income again should I buy fractional shares of something like Apple each month? Is there something else or something better I should put this in (something maybe under 20)? Maybe something like American Airlines or something travel related (purely mentioning them over delta because I can grab more of them)?

I’m really new and I tried day trading and that’s just not for me I’d rather see steady long(ish) term growth and not stress about dips when they happen. 

Any help/suggestions are appreciated!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Thank you Federal Reserve for forcing me to convert my "high-yield savings" account into stocks At one point, my "high yield" savings account was netting me 2% a year. But when the Fed started cutting rates in 2019, I got annoyed with the declining rates and decided it was time to learn about stock investing. 

I slowly bought starting last November and put in most of my money between March and June when the market was tanking. Through a simple strategy of picking blue-chip stocks, indexed ETFs, portfolio diversification, (and staying off Wall Street Bets), I am up 15% in one year, netting about $11,000 in profits when I would have gotten a fraction of that. Part of it was fortunate timing no doubt. 

My big winners have been NVDA 83% up, AMZN 79%, CMG 74% and BABA 63% and the low-cost ETFs I use to further diversify are QQQ, VOT, MGK, VGLT, VTWO and VWO. I learned hard lessons on BA 56%, PCG46% and INTC 27%. 

The biggest advice is would give to new investors is don't get greedy by chasing huge overnight gains with YOLO bets using options and leverage. Find well-run companies that you can hold long-term, make sure you don't overweight into certain sectors (I am guilty of this with amount of tech I hold), and you should be able to earn yourself steady returns. If you're afraid of jumping in because you think the market is at an all-time high, buy-in using DCA. 

I plan to hold my positions for the next five years and continue to slowly put more in.
