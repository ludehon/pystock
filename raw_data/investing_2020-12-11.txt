 Nasdaq OMX Commodities trading - nordic power market Hello,  


I am trying to find a broker that offers products for the Nasdaq OMX nordic power market.  


[http://www.nasdaqomx.com/transactions/markets/commodities/market-prices](http://www.nasdaqomx.com/transactions/markets/commodities/market-prices)  


I hear NordPool is a possibility, but it requires a heft 2-3mill $ license to get a trading seat? All the other generic brokers offer the usual commodities, but the power market is one I'm interested in researching further. Any tips?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Share sale structure between divorcing spouses? I'm wondering if anyone can make sense of something for me, like ELI5...

This scenario between my mom and her exhusband: They owned a company together worth quite a bit and were 50/50 shareholders. She divorced him and they entered into a "share sale" where he agreed to "buy her out" over 5 years.

There was concern via my moms tax advisors at the time when she received this letter from my exstep dads tax advisor:

"We are writing regarding exstepdads intent to purchase shares of (company) from (mom). 1. All of the shares held represent capital property to the shareholders. 2. We have relied on the clients to negotiate and provide fair market value. 3. (mom) will not utilize her capital gain deduction to shelter the capital gain created by the share sale and will claim a capital gain reserve on her personal tax return to the extent possible over the 5 year term" (mom) will agree to sell common shares of the company to (stepdad) at FMV.

my moms tax advisor says: " I am a bit surprised to see that this is worded as a fair value sale of capital property. I believe this is then a taxable transaction, rather than the typical tax-free transfer of capital property on separation/divorce.

Off the top of my head I am not sure I understand the motivation to recognize a fully taxable capital gain on the transfer of the shares. The letter does not address the purchase of (moms) shareholder loans. The settlement outline suggested that (exstepdad) would be entitled to them (1.7).I assume then that these are being transferred under the normal division of property rules, and not as part of the sale?"

Then my exstepdads lawyers said something about "wanting to crystallize the gains for a future transaction" "transferring all of exstepdads shares into a new company" and a restructuring. They said my stepdad would pay the tax consequences of this, since utilizing this structure was for his benefit, but never did.

Whatever this transaction was ended up bankrupting my mom, so I'm really trying to understand exactly what he did and how this benefited him? A transfer/split of shares is meant to be a tax-free transfer but they wrote it up in a way that caused a huge tax consequence to her. Could someone ELI5 please, if you understand?

https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ABNB/_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Why did I start investing in tech companies now? I was always planning to start investing my money, and one month ago, I finally started investing because I think this is the best time to start. As a total beginner, I want to share why I decided to start now and why I decided to invest in the tech. All these are my personal opinions/predictions and not financial advice.

##Why now?
Covid-19 changed many things quickly, and we started to see a totally different world. I am 32 years old, and until this year, I have never seen so many changes happened at light speed. Probably for a lot of businesses speed of growth accelerated at unbelievable levels. Especially in the tech industry. I will try to explain my logic for different cases.

##Ecommerce started to be the default option.
People started buying everything online as a default option. Most people who were hesitant to online shopping also now tried it and probably loved its simplicity. We saw the latest reports of e-commerce companies, and it shows the huge growth. This is why it is logical to start investing in some online shopping platforms like Amazon.

##Ecommerce software providers.
Another side of this story is e-commerce software providers like Shopify, BigCommerce, WooCommerce, Magento, etc. Many people started moving their offline businesses online, and many people who lost their jobs because of the pandemic started looking for opportunities to make money online. One of the best options to make money online is e-commerce. This is why e-commerce software providers gained an unbelievable amount of customers recently. You can see how much money all Shopify stores made in the total on Black Friday. $5.1B üò± It was $2.9B last year. It is a ~75% increase. üìàüí∞

##They are learning.
These numbers show huge growth already, but I think we haven‚Äôt seen the pandemic's real effect yet. The logic is simple, all this pandemic situation started around March, and if you probably count, most people didn‚Äôt understand how serious the situation. It took several months to realize what is going on. We are now in December, and it was only around 10 months now and all we know that learning e-commerce, creating a store, learning SEO, learning advertisement platforms, etc., have some learning curve, and it requires hard-work, experience, and time. Some of these people already started to make some good sales, but some are still learning and experimenting. It is just a matter of time for them to start being successful. After all, these brand new merchants will start to make a lot of sales it will also bring a lot of money (commissions/upgrade of packages) to e-commerce providers like Shopify. This is why I invested in Shopify. It will also have a butterfly effect and will start to grow other platforms that are providing services to online shop owners. I will list some of these platforms below.

##Platforms to hire freelancers.
Many freelancers on platforms like Upwork and Fiverr are providing digital services also will start to see a lot of demand in their craft. People will need someone who will make a logo and banners for their shop; they will need some developers and designers to customize their stores. And this is not the only service for online stores, but as remote work is a new standard now, companies increased the number of remote workers, and more people are being hired from these platforms then more commissions these platforms will start to gain. This is why I am also investing in Fiverr and Upwork.

##Software infrastructure providers.
As all these online business platforms and traffic on the internet increase, platforms like Cloudflare, Amazon Web Services, etc., also gain many new customers. These new customers are also slowly growing and learning and will finally use more services and upgrade their packages. This is why great companies like Amazon and Cloudflare are introducing a lot of cool stuff worth investing in.
The world is changed forever.
I think even if 1‚Äì2 years later Covid-19 won‚Äôt be part of our life's anymore the effects it brings to the world will stay forever. A lot of business owners were hesitant about working from home but they have seen it is possible and can be quite efficient. It is possible now to hire key people remotely and rely on them. All these lessons won‚Äôt go away after a pandemic and will stay with us together. Most people who learn to run online businesses won‚Äôt go back offline again as this is the brand new skill they learn in difficult times and they will only invest more in these skills. Also, people who started to use online services (like shopping) won‚Äôt be hesitant to it anymore and they will continue to use them._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Are any paid services worth it? 7investing / my wall st/ Motley Fools / Zacks What is the best services for stock picking out there?

A lot of people are torn between the two index‚Äôs to invest in long term and a lot also say either one works because they perform pretty similarly (most of weighting on the total stock index includes the S&P). 

However, the S&P 500 has a committee that deems companies ‚Äúworthy‚Äù of being included by certain criteria, most importantly needing to be a PROFITABLE company.

The total stock index includes all of those large profitable companies PLUS unprofitable companies.

From time to time, I can see differences in the structure of reported  (raw) financial statements and their corresponding consolidated financial statements.  Sometimes the consolidation is not a huge change, maybe just some addition of small expenses. However, sometimes the difference is huge.

To the best of my knowledge, the structure of an income statement is as follows: 

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Revenue

\- Cost of Goods Sold

=**Gross Profit**

**-** Other operating expenses

= **EBITDA**

**-** Depreciation

\-Amortization

= **Operating Income**

\+ Non-operating income

= **EBIT**

\- Interest Expense

= **Earnings before taxes**

\- Tax expense

= **Net Income**

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The reported (raw) income statement of Beyond Meat (BYND) from SEC and the consolidated one from Yahoo finance are totally different.

&#x200B;

¬†**the reported (raw) income statement of Beyond Meat (BYND) from SEC**

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

¬†2019 

Net revenues $ 297,897 

Cost of goods sold 198,141 

Gross profit (loss) 99,756 

¬†

Research and development expenses 20,650 

Selling, general and administrative expenses 74,726 

Restructuring expenses 4,869 

Total operating expenses 100,245 

Loss from operations (489) 

¬†\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

&#x200B;

The operating income is -$489,000 here, which is a negative number.

&#x200B;

**the consolidated one from Yahoo finance**

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BYND/financials?p=BYND](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BYND/financials?p=BYND)

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The operating income is $438,000,000 here, which is a positive number. The reason here is Yahoo Finance moved the 'Restructuring expenses' which cost $4,869,000 to a category called 'Other income expenses'.

&#x200B;

Now I have several questions.

1) Which version should I believe in? Or, which version provides me with more value in value investing?

2) Just out of curiosity, who decides how to 'consolidate' a financial statement?

3) Can companies/financial data agents like Yahoo use consolidated information to distorted the facts about the stocks?

I'm going to be looking for new-grad jobs sometime next year, and I was wondering how important it was in the grand scheme of things to join a company with a 401K plan immediately out of college. Most major companies that I'm gunning to work for has one, but I currently have an internship for next summer with a startup that pays well, covers insurance and gives stock options, but no 401K. I'm currently maxing out my Roth and putting the overflow into more index funds with a little bit of play money on the side for riskier assets. 

Would it be advisable to forgo a company simply because they don't offer a 401K, especially at this age? I'd want to work there otherwise since the work they're doing is cool and I'm already in their talent acquisition pipeline for full time, so it'd save a lot of stress from full-time recruiting next Fall, but I'm hesitant because I'd want my employer to match my money as early as possible.

Feedback?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ How to spot a bubble I lived through the 2016-2018 crypto bubble, and it was wild. For the last couple months I have been getting these moments of deja-vu and I can feel the same black cloud looming.

TLDR: when the majority of investors and ESPECIALLY newcomers think they can't lose.... they will, sooner than they think and more dramatically than they think

I got in to the crypto space right before the bubble, as I did with $TSLA last year. Early enough that I had/have taken enough profits to exit my lizard brain and actually evaluate what is going on. People came/are coming out of the woodwork, friends, co-workers, family members(some of them even asking about naked options), and as happened then and is happening now, they start making money hand-over-fist and it is infuriating. 1) you don't want to see them get hurt, and 2) why did I pragmatically take all that damn profit.

My co-workers would find some random coin on some scammy exchange and 5X their money. Read SPACs. Even the brighter ones would put money into solid projects that could change the world like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Read FAANG. Predominately the feeling was NO ONE CAN LOSE, MONEY IS INFINITE. Read [C3.ai](https://C3.ai), DoorDash, and AirBnB all IPOing in the same week. All raised their price targets multiple times before the IPO, and ALL DOUBLED ON THE FIRST DAY OF TRADING.....

Get your tissues out kids because here is the sad part. The crypto bubble popped. Friends and family lost buckets, people(read me) who said "even if it halves, I'm still up" didn't really understand what a bubble pop was and how far it could go. Co-workers who were over leveraged incurred life changing financial penalties.

In conclusion, from a micro, personally anecdotal POV this feels like a BFB(Big Fuckin Bubble). Blah blah blah inflation blah blah your dollar is a melting ice cube blah blah blah low interest rates blah.

For many, the valuations currently placed on high-growth tech companies are insane. Companies that have negative net income are often being valued at over 50 times revenue.

A lot of this concern occurs when we try to use the standard tools of value investors to analyse SaaS companies. Tools like discounted cash flow analyses and Price/Earnings ratios. How can a tech company be worth so much when it has negative earnings? A fair question to ask when looking at these companies from a ‚Äòvalue‚Äô perspective.

The problem, in my opinion, is related to how we think about profitability for high-growth subscription businesses. In a ‚Äòvalue‚Äô world, the more earnings/profit in a given year the better. However, with SaaS companies, it's the total profit over the lifetime of the company that matters. In SaaS, the majority of the revenue gained from an individual customer will come in the future, not at the point of customer acquisition/initial sale. Therefore, a SaaS company that is currently highly profitable is a company that can‚Äôt find good opportunities to efficiently acquire any more customers. If they could, they would be spending that money on sales & marketing since every dollar spent acquiring a customer would create well over a dollar in cash flow over the lifetime of that customer.

There is a lot of nuance here and lots of caveats but essentially this means that a SaaS company that is highly profitable is a SaaS company that likely won‚Äôt be able to maintain high growth rates into the future.

So, if DCF and P/E ratios aren‚Äôt the best metrics for high-growth SaaS companies, then what is?

In my opinion, one of the most important (and over-looked) metrics for analysing these companies is the Enterprise Value/Sales/Growth metric.

### Enterprise Value/Sales/Growth

Enterprise Value/Sales is one of the most common metrics you will see used to value high-growth tech companies. However, it misses the main reason that tech companies get such high valuations in the first place - their growth rates.

If you have two companies both valued at 50 times sales but one company is growing 60% per year while the other is only growing 20% per year, then you are looking at two very different companies.

When looking at the price of a tech company relative to its sales, it is critical to also look at its growth rate. This is where the EV/S/G metric is so useful.

The formula is as follows:

**(Enterprise Value/Revenue) / Revenue Growth Rate**

The closer to zero that a company gets on this metric the better. Companies with a score of over one are not doing as well and are not growing fast enough to justify their high valuations.

Let‚Äôs look at Zoom as an example (revenue and revenue growth are for the last 12 months as of 31st October):

**($119.2B / $1.96B) / 262.3% = 60.8 / 262.3**

**= EV/S/G of 0.23**

So you can see that even though Zoom is valued at 60 times sales, because of it‚Äôs exceptional growth rate over the last 12 months, it actually has an incredibly strong EV/S/G ratio. If it can keep up its exceptional growth rate (granted, that is a big IF), Zoom is actually undervalued relative to many other SaaS companies.

A company on the other end of the scale with a far less healthy EV/S/G ratio is Bill.com.

Bill.com has a similar EV/S ratio to Zoom of 60.4. However, they 'only' grew 39.24% over the last 12 months. They have an EV/S/G score of 1.54 which is far worse than Zoom‚Äôs 0.23.

### EV/S/G for popular tech companies

Here is the EV/S/G score for 6 of the most popular high-growth tech companies, ranked from best to worst.

1. Twilio = 0.58
2. Crowdstrike = 0.59
3. Shopify = 0.69
4. Docusign = 0.73
5. Datadog = 0.75
6. Okta = 0.92

### Other metrics

While EV/S/G is an incredibly useful metric, it‚Äôs not the only one that should be used by any means. It‚Äôs still important to measure things like gross profit, customer retention, customer lifetime value and free cash flow.

2 of my favourite metrics for analysing high-growth tech are:

* The rule of 40
* Enterprise Value/Gross Profit ratio

But there are lots, lots more.

What metrics do you use to analyse high-growth SaaS companies? Are there any metrics that you think are better than EV/S/G?

Hey everyone! I have been receiving a lot of great feedback about my Analyst Score (links below) so I wanted to share a different score that I've been tracking / working on to get some thoughts from the community. 

In short, the score takes five years of **free cash flows and divides them by total assets.** Is it a foolproof score? No. But what it does do is help quantitatively discover moats. 

Why? Well we want businesses to generate cash. If they're generating a big pile of cash on few assets then that business would be ripe for competition. That is unless, of course, that business had a moat of some kind. 

The score helped me discover **Collector's Universe** (CLCT) earlier in the year and I made over a 300% return on that. It also got me to add **Verisign** (VRSN) to my watchlist and I ended up making a 21% return on that after its pandemic drop with the broader market. 

So, here is a link to the Cash Flows / Total Assets score for every company I have that data for today. Word of warning though, financials and trusts can sometimes have weird balance sheets, so I've been avoiding them. 

Link to the data: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dRNnLmjEK4T\_n\_0iGsiO74w2a6RfYQK-FW1M7nAyMJY/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dRNnLmjEK4T_n_0iGsiO74w2a6RfYQK-FW1M7nAyMJY/edit?usp=sharing)

What does the community think? Useful metric, or lucky break with CLCT? I can tell you from looking at the list this time around that I am taking a deeper look into Manhattan Associates (MANH) and Medifast (MED). Both look like they're on fantastic runs of late.

**What if cash flows are from financing activities?** A valid flaw that can be seen in row 15 of the data with "Vasta Platform Ltd. Class A". Will look into running the score with cash flow from operations. 

**Why is this better than RoA / RoE?** I gravitate towards cash flow metrics because cash flow is what a company has to generate to survive. No cash == no business.

Shares in Chinese toymaker Pop Mart International Ltd. jumped as much as 112 per cent in their debut Friday, after home-rental platform Airbnb Inc. closed 113 per cent above its IPO price in New York. JD Health International Inc. surged 56 per cent in its debut Tuesday while DoorDash Inc. soared 86 per cent in on Wednesday.

The FTSE Renaissance Global IPO Index, which tracks the performance of offerings worldwide, is up 82 per cent this year, compared with a 12 per cent gain for MSCI‚Äôs all-country equity index. Comparing the current period with the dot-com bubble is hard to do directly because the Renaissance IPO Index didn‚Äôt start until 2009, and a Bloomberg index that was around in the dot-com boom became defunct in 2017.

There are some pretty clear similarities between the Bloomberg index versus the S&P 500 in 1998-99 and the Renaissance gauge now, noted Cameron Crise, a macro strategist at Bloomberg. The performance after that in the late 1990s was even more dramatic. If IPOs were to follow the same pattern now, they would have a huge jump still to come -- before a pretty spectacular drop.

‚ÄúThe action in these names is definitely a concern for us,‚Äù said Matt Maley, a strategist at Miller Tabak + Co., speaking about the U.S. IPOs.

‚ÄúHowever, we‚Äôd also note that experience tells us that froth in the IPO market tends to be a ‚Äòleading indicator‚Äô for an important top -- not an ‚Äòimmediate indicator‚Äô of a top. In other words, yesterday‚Äôs action in the IPO market probably tells us that we‚Äôll see a meaningful correction at some point over the next six to nine months, not necessarily over the next few days/weeks.‚Äù_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Adyen and Microsoft Launch Network Token Optimization !!

Who is ready for another wild day?

Let's dive right into it!

Today, I'll be discussing different tactics you could play SLS today and how I will play it: you can trade it short term or long term and what if it has a small dip, because expectations aren't met, or it shoots right to the stratosphere.

At 2:15 PM CT, Sellas will give their presentation of their NPS vaccine. (Don't misunderstand NPS with GPS, where SLS already got a license deal over with China.) If you already did DD on NPS, you know these results are incredible and extremely effective. (I'll be giving a link to Presentations of SLS in history at the end of my post, where you can check the results yourself) 

First, we're going over the situation where the presentation isn't as quite as amazing as we all think. It will probably dip, you'll buy more cheap shares and you'll wait till next week. Buy the dip and hold. We both know this is worth over 20+ (Market Cap now is 167 Million, their deal with China is over 200 Million. Market Cap is at least 200 Million worth. Small Calculation: 17.66\* (200/167) = $21.15) And here I am just talking about the Deal with China with licensing their GPS. I haven't even talked about the value of the NPS vaccine, the royalties of GPS and all their other amazing medicines in their pipeline. 

Secondly, the situation where it rockets to Mars (I specifically like this scenario).  Profits are profits, but don't sell too soon. This has still fuel in the tank and is still extremely undervalued. 3 days ago, we were at 448k volume, 2 days ago at 16 Million Volume and yesterday at an incredible 147 Million. Sell when you're gut feeling is telling you and don't look back at how much more profit you could have made, don't FOMO into the spike.

Other guys buy the rumor and sell the news, which is also an excellent tactic, where they already sold yesterday or going to sell before the presentation. I, however, am extremely bullish on the whole company and call me crazy, but I do believe they have a chance to break GLSI's ATH. My reasoning behind it and here we go a little scientific: GLSI has incredible results for their vaccine (0% recurrence rate), however this is only for women who are HER2 3+. SLS has a vaccine for patients who are hormone receptor-negative AND HER2 1+/2+. GLSI also has no license deal yet, while SLS has one with China worth 202 Million. 

So I will hold when it dips and I strongly recommend buying extra shares if it does. If it goes to Mars today and is going to halt multiple times today, I will consider selling the hype, but I will CERTAINLY get back in at a lower price again.

Good luck and let's make some money today :)

&#x200B;

TLDR; Seriously recommended to read the whole stuff. For the people with no time or who read this just at Market Open: Dipping, hold and buy more shares. Wait till it hit at least 20+ (which won't be long at all). Ripping, don't sell too soon and don't fomo. The only thing we have to do now is time the top :)

The Indicators I use: RSI, Stochastic, MACD, and 10-50-200 EMA lines

These are all charted on a 180D/4H candle chart.

**$DOC**:We have an ascending trendline that it just tapped into. Under is a support area, and we have had consistent higher lows through the last few months. It is below both EMA lines so it needs to break these to have true strength. If it breaks price resistance over $18.00 - this is gonna be a runner!

**$GOOS**: Great ascension and uptrend over the last 6 months, now making a new channel. IT showed life at our $30.75 support area, and this is above our 70% volume area - which is a great sign of life here. All indicators cannot get lower, so we have plenty of room to run!

**$HLT**: This stock loves to make a move up to a new channel, establish itself, then do it again. We have a beautiful move up and now a new channel. It showed life before and now has room to run, and even has a chance to make a newer channel over $111. The stochastic cannot get much lower, and MACD is about to cross. It is above all 3 EMA lines as well, beautiful setup.

**$JCI**: What a beautiful trendline up! We are now at the bottom of the channel up, support, and 50EMA which it respects as well. It has plenty of room to run and if the trend continues, the longer you hold the more you will make until this channel is broken. It is a gorgeous price action setup.

**$MTNB**: We have a channel up over the last month, and today it lives again. It has a resistance at $1.08 and that is only $.02 away. IF the trend holds and it makes this resistance into a support, you will make plenty of money. It is also being bolstered by the 50EMA right below it, which also gives it steam into this resistance.

**$PEAK**: 3 month uptrend and the stock is slowly reversing right in this channel. No coincidence it is coupled with a support, and the top of our 70% volume area as well. Stochastic and RSI oversold, so it has plenty of steam up.

**$PRTA**: 7 month uptrend up channel, and it is above it so we technically have room to drop. But this support right above our Point of Control node is holding so this is also a good area to buy right now. This stock has beautiful channels and the Stochastic cannot get much lower, and is showing a bullish divergence. Watch this one, it is beautiful.

**$ROK**: Up trending channel again today; and is right in the channel which is beautiful. It is trying to break this resistance at $251; and if it does it is going to make a beautiful move. Indicators show neither good or bad signs, it all comes down to this potential reversal right here.

**$SILV**: 7 month horizontal channel that is still moving along. It is in the point of control volume area so it is extremely powerful in terms of being a support. If it lives here you can easily see 15% profit at our next resistance. Indicators are also in the middle so not good or bad at this point, both EMA lines are above so keep that in mind.

**$WDAY**: Gooooooorgeous uptrend up, and it is right above this line. It is coupled with a support and a 200EMA line, and all indicators show bullish days ahead?!

What is this company?
	"Village Farms International, Inc., together with its subsidiaries, produces, markets, and distributes greenhouse-grown tomatoes, bell peppers, and cucumbers in North America.

With one of the largest greenhouse operations in the country, it is well positioned for the potential federal legalization of high-THC cannabis. 
	Michael DeGiglio, the chief executive officer of Village Farms International, during a 2020 third-quarter financial results call, said: ‚ÄúOnce we launch in Texas, we will be sort of first in when assets are ready to go. We already have our conversion plans. We're ready to go in Texas. And that's the same population nearly as Canada and the way Texas is going is probably be very close the next few years. 
	So that in itself is like the Republic of Texas or a country, but that doesn't mean we won't work nationally. And we're prepared to look at, if we have to do acquisitions or strategic partnerships and other locations where we can bring our strengths to the table. I think there's a lot of opportunity there. We're pretty well-known.

For anyone interested here's some more information about what's going on.

I posted this on another subreddit, but got mostly downvotes and no discussion, so maybe you can take what I have to share and give your opinion.

I have reason to believe that the US Covid-19 recovery is going to reverse it's bullish trend starting sometime this month. One can construct a support line for daily ticks beginning after the initial crash in March, as shown above. This trend line was crossed from above twice in the past few months, and is now riding on the line. 

Looking at the Pring's Special K indicator, it shows a trending wave near the support line crosses, with the latest peak happening this week. 

If this PSK wave continues, we can expect SPY to break down from the support line. A break down from the trend may imply that SPY would be going into bear territory for at least the next month, and possibly further out.

What are your thoughts about the possibility of a recessive economy starting sometime this month and extending further into 2021? Will the prospect of a stimulus bill push SPY upward from the support line?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ USA FDA Committee has approved the coronavirus vaccine made by Pfizer $PFE USA FDA Committee has approved $PFE vaccine.
