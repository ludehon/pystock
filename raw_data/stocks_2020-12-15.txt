The merged company is expected to retain the Tilray name and appoint Aphria Chief Executive Officer Irwin Simon as its CEO, the sources said. Aphria is likely to emerge with a majority of the combined company’s board seats and with its shareholders owning a 60 per cent stake, although that could change, added one of the sources who has direct knowledge of the matter​.

Negotiations between the two companies were ongoing as of Tuesday and there's no guarantee that a deal will be completed. 

The merged Aphria-Tilray company will likely move its headquarters to the United States as part of a strategy to bolster its presence in that country, the sources said. Sales of cannabis in the U.S. have increased substantially over the past year amid rising marijuana usage during the COVID-19 pandemic. Aphria is currently headquartered in Leamington, Ont.; Tilray is based in Nanaimo, B.C. 

The two companies are eyeing up to $100 million in annualized cost savings by joining forces, while Aphria would produce the bulk of the combined entity's Canadian cannabis inventory to fully utilize its 1.3 million square-foot greenhouse in Leamington, Ont., the sources said. It is unclear what will happen to Tilray's production facilities in Nanaimo, B.C. and London, Ont., but one of the sources who has indirect knowledge said they are likely to be wound down. 

**If Tilray and Aphria manage to finalize an agreement, the deal would create the biggest cannabis company in Canada and a major player in the global pot sector. Tilray's international operations, which include a world-class production facility in Portugal, is said to be one of the jewels of the deal, the sources said. Tilray also has substantial operations in Australia, Germany and the U.K.; meanwhile, Aphria has a German pharmaceutical distribution business.**

The combined company would control a leading 19 per cent share of the Canadian recreational cannabis market and annual revenue north of $930 million, based on the two companies' most recent quarterly results as well as revenue generated by Sweetwater Brewing Co., which Aphria acquired last month.

This is the second time in recent months that Aphria is said to have had its eye on being a consolidator in Canada’s crowded cannabis sector. BNN Bloomberg reported in July that the Leamington, Ont.-based pot giant was in serious negotiations with Aurora Cannabis Inc., but talks between the two companies broke down due to differences over board composition and compensation.

One of the key differences between Aurora and Tilray is that the latter generates roughly half of its revenue from its Manitoba Health hemp food business. That would likely appeal to Aphria given Simon's previous role running organic health food operator Hain Celestial Group Inc., and could add steady revenue to its non-cannabis subsidiaries, such as German pharmaceutical distribution business CC Pharma and Sweetwater Brewing._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ 2021 Prediction for markets  Came across some predictions suggesting that there might be a correction sometime in 2021.

20% margin of safety.
Full post with images (this sub doesn't allow images): https://www.reddit.com/r/UndervaluedStonks/comments/kdswr7/part_13_nasdaqwilc_with_a_20_margin_of_safety_a/


**Part (1/3) NASDAQ:WILC**

There are 3 parts to valuing this company as they have 2 other related public companies in their hierarchy and to get an overall view of the best one to buy we need to value each one.

**Background**

Willi-Food (WILC) is an Israeli supermarket wholesaler. They import food from abroad and also make in house multiple different grocery store products.

They have had a huge boost recently due to the COVID-19 pandemic and them being an essential business. Israeli's have been buying a lot more from supermarkets recently due to it and WILC revenue's recently have soared 19% YOY. This will fizzle out though now as we have a vaccine.

**Competitors**

The standard competitors are the big Israeli food supermarkets who compete with WILC for shelving space for their foods. By Israeli law the supermarkets must designate a certain amount of shelving space to other companies.

>The food law includes a temporary order to limit the shelf space of very large suppliers (defined as retailers whose annual sales exceed NIS 1 billion) to 50% of the shelf space at large stores (defined as stores with more than 250 square meters) of larger retailers. The purpose is to enable medium-sized and small suppliers, such as the Company

This is taken from the companies 10k. WILC is currently classed as a medium supplier.

WILC has sales in TTM of $446.04m NIS. So they are currently way under the threshold to become a large supplier. And because WILC is a slow grower (usually 5% growth a year apart from in COVID times) they will take some time to hit this figure (15+ years).

**Hierarchy**

Here's the hierarchy of WILC's structure of it's company. Remember this for later as it's very very important and why you should always check a companies parents and subsidiaries (especially if they are public).

Willi-Food Investments Ltd has a 62.05% stake in WILC.B.S.D Crown Ltd. has a 67.88% stake in WILC (through Willi-Food Investments).

Joseph and Zwi (Co-founders) both have a 73.48% stake in B.S.D Crown Ltd.

Willi-Food Investments Ltd is quoted on the Telaviv stock exchange under this ticker: TLV:WLFD.B.S.D Crown Ltd is quoted on the London Stock exchange under this ticker: LSE:BSD.

We will be valuing both TLV:WLFD and LSE:BSD in the follow-up posts so don't go and buy WILC just yet as there's a secret gem here.

**Co-Founders and Board History**

We cannot go further without mentioning the crazy past of WILC's history (and it's owners).As stated above BSD Crown is the company which ultimately owns WILC due to it's majority stake in the company.

In 2012 a Ukrainian corrupt oligarch called Alexander Granovsky & Gregory Gurtovoy bought a majority stake in BGI Investments. BGI investments at the time had a controlling interest in BSD Crown (which itself held a controlling interest in WILC). Mr. Granovsky then proceeded to take out a ton of dodgy loans from shady banks offering collateral from the company.

When the scandal broke he fled Israel and a bunch of people were arrested. Subsequently around 2017 (I forget the exact date) BSD Crown was taken over by the Zwi and Joseph brothers again.WILC and it's parents have had a lot of lawsuits due to this. Some of them are still outstanding but none of them are majorly impactful anymore. The Co-founders I believe are not apart of this scandal and their doesn't seem to have been anything linking them to it ever.

I believe that the market is pricing in a slight discount due to these factors.

**Relative Numbers**

- No debt
- Operating margin 14%
- ROIC 20% vs WACC 3%
- PEG  0.75, however this is inflated due to COVID so I'd say a normalized PEG of 1 is correct here.

**Absolute Numbers**

I used Aswath Damoradan's spreadsheet DCF for this.

**Value driving inputs:**

5% 1-5 yr growth rate - The growth will go back to the mean after covid is done.

9% EBIT margin - I think the margins will lower after covid and stabilize here until WILC hits 1 billion NIS sales annually (no time soon).

8 Year of convergence - The time it takes for the margins to revert from the high of 11% to 9%.

2.00 sales to cap ratio (The reinvestment effectiveness rate) - As they are a slow grower this affects the DCF very little so does not matter much.

EBIT % is the real driver of value here due to them being a slow grower.

**Cost of capital**:

0.04% Riskfree Rate - I used the israeli 10 yr gov. bond yield minus the default spread of israel.

0.52 Unlevered Beta - due to them being a grocery supplier they have little risk.

0.52 Levered Beta - due to them having no debt.

6.26% ERP - I used the Operating Country of Israel for the ERP as they are in 1 industry and pretty much just Israel.

1.63% Pre-tax Cost of Debt - I used a synthetic rating from Aswath's Sheet and got 1.63%.

3.29% Cost of Capital - Due to all of the above. This will be used as the discount rate.

**Valuation**

Images not allowed here so cant post.

I personally got a 20% margin of safety.

Current price: $20

Estimated price: $25

I'm not very bullish on WILC itself, I'm bullish on one of it's parent companies which I will come to in the follow up post.

Also a lot of people hate Israeli companies on reddit because they think they are all scams and downvote any post about them. This isn't the case, some are gems.

In parts 2 & 3 DCF's I will show you why the parent companies TLV:WLFD and LSE:BSD are far superior purchases and why it pays to do due diligence.

Thanks x_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Tesla's software is years ahead of the competition, giving it a huge advantage over legacy automakers, prominent VC says https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-fsd-software-advantage-over-other-automakers-gene-munster-2020-12

Tesla, according to Munster, is years ahead of its competitors in that regard, and his firm estimates that the EV maker will recognize billions in deferred software revenue through 2022. 

The latest beta version of Tesla's "full self-driving" feature — and the fact that the firm was able to release it through an OTA update in October — further proves Tesla's technological lead, according to Munster. He estimates  Tesla is three years ahead of other carmakers when it comes to advanced driver-assistance features. 

Loup Ventures estimates that Tesla will recognize $1.1 billion in deferred software revenue in 2021 and $1.5 billion in 2022 from OTA updates, access to its Supercharger network, and, mainly, the adoption of "full self driving." Customers have purchased the feature, but Tesla has not fully released it, so it hasn't yet recognized that revenue on its balance sheet._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ PEIX - good buy for a single stock in cleaner energy I'm a fan of investing in cleaner energy (not just wind and solar, but also low carbon).

Curious in your thoughts and outlooks on this company!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Skepticism of the Psychedelic Stock Hype I’d like to start this post by saying I’m not arguing with the science behind using psychedelics as treatments for a variety of mental health ailments. I have read research and heard anecdotal evidence of them helping people treat depression, anxiety, adhd, etc. I believe they are valid treatment options and would be open to using them myself. I’d like to list a few reasons why I think they aren’t valid as large companies. 

**Legislation**

Psychedelics are illegal in a majority of countries and the legalization process takes years to come to fruition. Even then, a majority of countries will struggle to achieve legalization due to the powerful nature of psychedelics. This will greatly reduce the addressable market and lower the ceiling for psychedelic companies. Keep in mind that many countries have decriminalized the use of psychedelics, which is not the same thing as legalization. Decriminalization does not equate to the ability to openly sell. 

**Niche**

I understand that many of the companies aren’t necessarily trying to sell psychedelics alone, but rather offer them in therapy settings. While this is the most promising pathway, it is also very specific and too early on for widespread treatment. The medical community seems to be very strict on what’s acceptable as treatment, which means that already existing drugs such as antidepressants or stimulants are going to be first choice prescriptions for corresponding mental health illnesses. These drugs have had years of trials and long term research on their effectiveness, while psychedelic research is only now becoming more studied. Again, I am not arguing which treatment is better or worse, just the reality of the current situation. I believe that psychedelics will be reserved for those with treatment resistant depression, PTSD and addiction. This will create a niche type of therapy that is inaccessible and unaffordable for the general population. 

**Preconceived Notions**

The war on drugs has really soured peoples ideas of psychedelics. Preliminary research that was conducted in the 1960s was immediately quashed by the US government and psychedelics were labeled as dangerous hallucinogens. This label is the main reason why widespread legalization probably will not happen. A large portion of the population will not be open to using psychedelics even under professional therapeutic settings. 


**History Repeats Itself**

People jumped on the cannabis hype train in the past few years until it all came crashing down. I don’t think this situation will be any different. Even with widespread acceptance and legalization, cannabis companies were unable to successfully navigate the new space. The addressable market is much larger and more broad for cannabis than it is for psychedelics, so the potential for growth for psychedelics isn’t as promising. I think psychedelic companies are going to be a pump and dump play in the near term. 

This all being said, I hope I’m wrong, and psychedelics take off as an effective new treatment. However, right now I see too many things working against it for any of these new companies to truly take off. Feel free to disagree with me, I’d love to hear opinions._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Changes to Calls/Puts Open Interest Holdings Monday, December 14 End of Day How many open interest calls were added in the last 24 hours:

**Red Light Holland Corp (CSE: TRIP) (OTC Pink: TRUFF)** is an Ontario-based corporation positioning itself to engage in the production, growth, and sale of a premium brand of magic truffles to the legal market.

They started in the Netherlands and are continuously expanding, they just announced three huge moves that I believe could grow this company.

Red Light and Halo Labs just created a joint venture to become a licensed psilocybin manufacturer to supply psilocybin products to licensed service centers in the State of Oregon. Oregon Measure 109 where progressive Oregonians have voted in favor of becoming the first state in the US, to allow the use of psilocybin, for therapeutic use. This could be HUGE for Red Light Holland!

They also just announced that they're growing 1 million grams of truffles which is 10X their first batch (which has already been pre-sold).

On top of this news, Red Light Holland and Disruptive Pharma, a Latin American focused pharmaceutical investment company, just announced they have entered into a non-binding letter of intent for the purposes of creating a joint venture to cultivate, manufacturer, and commercialize magic truffles for the Brazilian market.

Of course, I'm biased because I'm now becoming invested in this company. But look at this news, the world is changing and these guys are actually manufacturing the truffles and commercializing them in the markets.

Does Apple have room to grow again? DASH & ABNB are fading after crazy IPOs. Let’s talk about this and the latest stock market news**

**\~Very Long Post\~**

Hello everyone and Good morning! So, let’s start with the recap of Monday, as we saw a great start in the early morning with the Dow hitting an intra-day record, but the rally faded for the broader stock market and especially the industrial heavy [DOW JONES](https://ibb.co/yVcZV95) which lost .61%, with the broad market [SP500](https://ibb.co/xGBkgyF) also losing .44% while the tech heavy [NASDAQ](https://ibb.co/dWNjyCY) lived up to the recent reputation as a go-to defensive play yesterday and finished up .50%. Meanwhile the [VIX](https://ibb.co/mH5Pmsw) also spiked more than 6% and is nearing the 25 levels, which could mean significantly more volatility for the stock market.

We also saw more companies declining [yesterday](https://ibb.co/jwVnsXt) on normal volume of about 10.5B shares, as we finally went below 80% of the companies trading above the 50-day simple moving average, as small-cap growth companies outperformed [yesterday](https://ibb.co/NNWkSQt) with large-cap value companies lagging, especially from the energy and industrial sectors. With energy losing more 3.5% for the day, while the only 2 gaining [sectors](https://ibb.co/0ymGMHL) were Technology and Consumer Discretionary, which seems to indicate what I was expecting, that investors are dropping losers from this year for tax purposes and betting again on the companies that sparked the rally since the bottom in March. And keep in mind that funds & money managers use this tactic for window dressing also, so that they can have a nice advertising brochure for next year.

Here is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/kMTNKY7) from yesterday, you can see here the big wall of red in the energy sector, with Disney which saw a healthy correction after a huge run and Pfizer being some of the biggest losers. While Netflix, Amazon, Nvidia, Tesla and PayPal were some of the biggest gainers alongside the biotech sector.

[HERE](https://ibb.co/tPnzGmN) is the economic data that will be received today, there isn’t anything big on the calendar, as we get ready for a lot of big numbers coming on Wednesday and Thursday. Just a reminder, there was no big economic data that came in yesterday.

So, Quadruple witching day is just a couple of days away, and this time it will probably bring even more heavy trading volume than usual.

For anyone that doesn’t know, quadruple witching [refers](https://ibb.co/p063Sgw) to the day when stock options, stock index futures & options and single stock futures expire on the same day. 

This happens 4 times every single year, and usually brings increased [volume](https://ibb.co/Gxr4pnc) to the stock markets, and guess what guys, this will coincide with the last day of trading before Tesla enters the SP index.

So I believe this next week and especially the 17th-22nd will be very volatile for Tesla. 

At the [moment](https://ibb.co/SRTyzcN) there is more open interest in tesla stock options, with over 8 million contracts, which multiplied by 100 shares for each contract represent 800M shares, that is more than the actual free float for the stock at the moment at 760M shares.

And, right now, there are a lot more put options contract on Tesla, with a put to call ratio of 1.5

My personal opinion is that we can see the stock continue to rise in the following days before going for a dip or correction following this huge moment of volatility for the stock. We can see the avg [volume](https://ibb.co/qYNg2dL) for Tesla has been near 60M shares in the last 10days, so there have been a lot of shares that have already exchanged hands. I believe most of the money managers, who are not obliged to perfectly track the SP indexes, have already finished up buying the stock, so I expect there will be a lot more sellers than buyers when most retail investors expect the stock to go even higher. But don’t take my advice, do your own research and analysis. Full disclosure, I am a bull long-term on Tesla, but just think there is a downside risk approaching.

So let go through a couple of stock market news, [Apple](https://ibb.co/NVQsB0b) is planning on manufacturing almost 100M new iPhone in the first half of 2021, that would be an increase of almost 30%, as they are planning make more than 230M iPhones in 2021 (including new & old models). This is great news for the stock as Apple has been pretty much flat after the September pullback, and might finally get some momentum back when they announce sales for the iPhone in the next quarters.

This might also be helped by the fact that US [consumers](https://ibb.co/f2Tfhpj) are expecting to spend more next year, even if they expect to have a pretty much flat income and earnings growth. This is an improving view of the consumers as they were expecting to spend less in the last survey from October.

Meanwhile, as I expected [AirBnB](https://ibb.co/xSdVJrG) and [Doordash](https://ibb.co/wLfyvFG) have started to fade after that crazy IPO frenzy. [Doordash](https://ibb.co/tmyyWnW) fell more than 8% yesterday and is down again pre-market while [AirBnB](https://ibb.co/GnRxn3b) is also down almost 10% since last week. And with downgrades from analysts already starting to appear, this companies have small to no room for error at this valuation. Especially with Doordash which has received a significant boost in the last year, growth will be more difficult in the future and won’t justify this price point.

We have also seen [Snowflake](https://ibb.co/J5j6DsP) come back to earth, dropping more than 15% in the last 5 trading days, as the first share lockup period expiration is today. This will allow current and former employees to sell 25% of their stock options, currently representing 1,3M shares. With Non-employee shareholders also able to sell up to 25% of shares, those shares stand at 38M right now, with the rest of the shares being unlocked after they release their second quarterly earnings report in March, 

We also got [numbers](https://ibb.co/8srNcwj) from New Jersey, as gambling keeps expanding even if sports are not back to normal. This is great news for companies like DraftKings. While others like Wynn will [benefit](https://ibb.co/zHL4Gvw) a lot from more tourism both in the US and in Macau.

And just keep an eye on [Shopify](https://ibb.co/nMHptKW), as the company seems to be in the eye of the tiger, with Amazon looking into ways of entering that market also.

So, guys, I still think there are a lot of positive catalysts for the markets, especially with a stimulus apparently very close, the European Central Bank [agreed](https://ibb.co/xqWDmZs) last week on a new stimulus for the Eurozone, as they keep printing money. And with interest rates probably remaining incredibly low after this week FED meeting, money will remain very cheap at the moment. So yeah, with the Pfizer vaccine yesterday, Moderna probably next week, and JNJ to follow in early 2021, I think we are poised for a good 2021 in the stock market. Especially with little political volatility after the Georgia run-off in early January as the US electoral College also formally [confirmed](https://ibb.co/pvjc9nf) Biden as the next President of the US yesterday.

Let’s hope for a great day in the market as the [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/vjT9ghr) seem to be pointing at a good open, hopefully some green action continues after that.

Third time writing this, so I'm gonna keep it even simpler. (thanks to copy not working)

I'm 23, live in France, and I have a major part of my savings in an account with 0.50% return. So it's pretty shitty.

I want to invest in ETFs like VOO & VUG, and I'm using eToro as of now, but how, as a french baguette, could I invest in them, and have a platform still up 5,10,20 years form now, and the most "secure" as far as security can go for this type of things.

eToro has them, but Before doing anything, I figured in could be smart to ask around.

Thanks a lot for any of your answers.

Do you think the price will drop Friday and level itself back out on Monday, or do you think it will stay steady and shoot up on Monday? Just trying to get others thoughts on the matter._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ When does bad fundamentals not matter? So I've been into speculation and investing for a short while now, and I've been 'practicing' analysing companies fundamentals and watching them. I've also been watching things like tesla in the news, seeing these massive booms got me curious.

I went to look at tesla in more detail and their net profit has always been in negative numbers? They loose money through operations as a company and on paper (at least from what I've learned) they dont look like a good investment.

The only thing I can think of is people placing their bets on EVs being the next big thing and hoping these numbers will turn around. - Is this the only reason to disregard the not so healthy looking income statements and balance sheets or am I missing something?

I feel like this amazing bull run is flattening out and we are in the beginning of a potential bear market. My portfolio is mostly growth stocks, EVs, solar, tech and a few meme stocks.

I'm thinking this week, in anticipation of a long bear market, that I'm going to rearrange my portfolio to something that will be able to survive a bear market a lot more than my current one does. I'm thinking blue chips like MSFT, GOOG, AMZN, DIS. Replace all of the volatile stocks like DKNG, SPCE,  BB, PLTR etc.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.

The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **"priced in"**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

I might be totally wrong but is candlestick an accurate price movement representation of stocks? The OHLC with the big bar filled with either red or green and highs and lows with a very thin line while the between is big and fat while it ONLY represents the opening and closing of the price. Yet a big fat rectangular shape making us think the price was in that range mainly and the thin line indicating it was at that price for a short period of time.

Candlestick could be totally down for 4.5 mins and suddenly rise and it would very inaccurately show the candlestick as being green when it was very much in the red for 90% of the time duration. People say when there's no wick at the top it means huge buying pressure while it could totally be up/at the high for the last seconds of the bar at the very last moment and would be misinterpreted. 

Can someone indicate to me if there exists a candlestick which shows — A TIME Based Candlestick which represents the duration of time the stock price was at a certain level. For eg. A price band from 105 to 96 with the stock price being at 96 for 2 minutes, 97 for a single minute, every penny counted for the seconds the price was in the price frame with 0.05 difference accounted for. 100 for 30 seconds and again 96 for another minute and suddenly 105 for a minute. 
If there's a tool that depicts this scenario, it would be very helpful.

range for how long.

Currently, there are a myriad of investment funds (I.e. Hedge Funds, VC Funds, PE Funds, Ect) that are generating very strong and consistent returns, often 25% IRR or more.

However, the average investor will never have the ability to invest due to the lack of connections and fact that most have a min. check size - typically $1 M or more.

That's according to Dan Ives, a Wedbush Securities senior tech analyst, who said in a note to clients on Sunday that demand from China could help Tesla reach or possibly exceed it's once implausible goal of 500,000 deliveries by the end of 2020. Ives sees Tesla surging 56% from current levels to $1,000 a share in his bull case scenario. 

"We believe the company is tracking to another strong month of December in China which could be the tipping point to get Musk & Co. to hit/exceed its 500k annual delivery target, an achievement not even on the map for the Street going back to the late spring/summer timeframe," Ives said.

"The China growth story is worth at least $100 per share in a bull case to Tesla as this EV penetration is set to ramp significantly over the next 12 to 18 months, along with major battery innovations coming out of Giga 3 and elsewhere throughout the China EV supply chain," the analyst added.

Analyst rating and price target : do not mater

No mater what I tried backtesting showed that analyst underperform the S&P by a large margin. The price targets are marginally more reliable then general ratings but in general it’s all a load of S***

Eps, earnings, p/e, etc : all the profitability ratings were again functionally meaningless. Ironically if you bought either the worst or the best set of 10 you could find every week your results would be identical...

Dividend : currently irrelevant, but in 2016-2017 investing for the dividends outperformed the S&P by 200% in just a single year. if you went with a buy and hold strategy for minimum 1 year. This has seen a flattened decline since then bringing 5year returns in line with the S&P500. (Caveat see below)

1wk, 4wk, and 13wk lows (buy the dip)..: this strategy by far outperforms every other, when combined with dividends this vastly outperformed the S&P for the 2016-17 period as above.

On its own buying the dip showed consistent gains on the S&P over all time periods. Although to a lesser extent than when combined with dividends in 2016-17. Giving a total ROI of 400% compared to S&P 230% returns.

Some other insights:

Investing in indexes gives the indexes average returns no mater what. Regardless of tested strategy when tested with restrictions to only stocks on the S&P or DJI observed returns were in line or slightly above the index even with the worst performance strategy.

Sliding window on price showed that on average stocks in price brackets of 5$-90$ performance gave the largest positive divergence from the index performance. Stocks in price bracket over 70$ increasingly track the S&P eventually providing ROI identical to index. Testing this bracket with analyst rating showed no correlation beyond random choice.

This backtesting was done with IBKR and didn’t use any fancy indicator logic, it was just set to buy the top 10 stocks sorted by the criteria presented and rebalanced every week. At the end of the day it appears that you really can not beat buying the dip in terms of portfolio performance._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ To pull out of BNTX or to hold? Long term potential?

Or to wait for it to come back up eventually as it is a newer company that could have a bright future in the pharma space.

Has anyone done analysis on BNTX long term, withholding the vaccine news? I would love to hear some opinions because this drop could be a potential buy oppurtunity._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Demand for dry ice is exploding to keep vaccines cold Both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines have to be kept at -20 degrees C or lower. This means MASSIVE quantities of dry ice will be needed to sheep these vaccines around the world. A company like APD might be a good investment right now. See link.

You guys have tons of more experience in terms of knowledge. If it was between these 2 stocks AMD and Disney. Who would you you feel more comfortable in buying.
If I plan on holding it till December 2021 or little longer if it shows growth. Do you guys see AMD hitting 200 by end of next year and do you see Disney getting in that 250-280 range with the vaccine and Disney world eventually opening.

I am sorry if this is not the place to post this. I was just hoping for some guidance as I have done my due diligence on them but was hoping for more insight.

State your prediction and !remind me in 2 years._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Asking the stock masters of Reddit why BioNTech stock is plummeting? I’m just really confused, it’s the only vaccine to be approved in the US currently, and it’s down to 108 a share from 130. I have about 1600 invested and was up about $500. Is it because people are worried about storage of the vaccine or other competitors release or one? I also am thinking about investing a couple grand into it again, since it’s down, I have hopes it’ll go up, thoughts from the masters?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Thoughts on IEA? I’ll start by saying I didn’t start investing until this year. I feel like I’m getting a better grasp on things now, but at the beginning, I did take the advice of a coworker who’s been doing it longer. 

Per his advice, I bought IEA around $11 ish and DCA’d as it dropped, so now at $10.70. Does anyone know why it’s been consistently dropping? I don’t know whether to hold long term or try and get out and at least break even if I can. 

I realize this is a noob question and I apologize. The last thread on IEA that I see was from over a month ago and I’m having trouble figuring it out myself._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ I have 20k to add to a trading account and just wanted to get some opinion. I’m planning on the 40% ETF 40% blue chip and 20% higher risk. Is there anything I need to do with regards to staggering buys or any stupid mistakes you’ve seen people like me, with limited exposure to the stock market, make?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ My Watchlist For 12/15/2020  **\*\*I trade off the 180D/4H Chart. I use RSI, Stochastic, MACD, and 10-50-200 EMA Lines\*\***

*Red Dotted Line - Highest Volume Area*

*White Dotted Line - Area where 70% of volume takes place*

*White Solid Lines - Supports and Resistances*

*Golden Lines - Trendlines I like*

**$CDXC:** Right above the golden ascending channel; but holding support right now at the Point of Control. It also is above the 50 & 200EMA as well! Stoch is super low as well, it is a great setup.

**$CTLT:** This beautiful channel play just confirmed and holding life over this support. which is also an important volume area. Just broke the 50EMA, but indicators are a little worn out, might see a small pullback.

**$ETN:** Gorgeous channel play here. It is at a support area, channel line, and right near the 200EMA, which is dope. RSI & Stoch are oversold, and showing a Bullish Divergence!

**$FEYE:** Long term ascending triangle, at its channel support area. Holding support as well, recently oversold, and Stoch is fair. Both EMA's are above so they will be resistance eventually.

**$GSKY:** This support is very strong, but it has a chance to break down to $3.45. RSI & Stoch oversold which is awesome. Once it breaks this downtrend, it is going to go crazy.

**$JILL:** Such a beautiful channel for potential massive plays. 200EMA is what it is riding safely, and it is above the 50EMA as well. It broke the downtrend now going back up, this thing has Bullish Divergence and power.

**$LL:** Very strong channel that is now a rising wedge, and it is perfectly riding the 50EMA line now. Stoch is low, and if it dies more, but at wedge trendline, if it dies more just bounce off 200EMA!

**$NEW:** Obvious channel but also obvious room for earnings. Support, RSI oversold, Stoch oversold with divergence, and MACD can't get lower -- what a value.

**$NIO:** 2 Loooooong term channels meeting here, but in an obvious downtrend. If it breaks above here it will go crazy once again. Above 200EMAand such, Stoch and RSI recently oversold as well.

**$PNW:** The middle golden channel is a great value, and if it lives here it has plenty of room to run. RSI and Stoch oversold, with divergence as well. Great setup.

**$PSNL:** Previous trendline resistance being tested as a support. If it dies here, re-test the 50EMA then 200EMA, but watchlist this one. Indicators show room to drop.

**$SWI:** Textbook sell off play into Volume POC and support, and showing life. I you like these type of plays, all indicators show reversal soon - and a good area for it to show life._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ AVRO flying under the radar I like to search for the biggest losers in stocks and occasionally I come across something of value. This stock tanked about a month ago because of an offering and finally signaled its uptrend over the last week. 

Looking at its chart, it regularly goes from 12$-16$ and I believe it’s heading back to 16 again. Currently sitting at 13.50. Totally under the radar right now AND all analyst are rating this as a buy.
