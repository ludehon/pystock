**Edit:** The link has been fixed._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Oh my.. short interest % of float is 42.61 _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ There were a bunch of people asking me to backtest a trading strategy based on my daily WSB updates. I did something similar a while back, but here's an updated version. _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Where the next year takes us.. Hope everyone is doing well this fine day. Here are some good and interesting stocks to add to your research list. Not everything has to be A GME AMC bagholder debacle. Where are they now?

Anyways, There are many good plays to watch out for: OPEN,  offers to property sellers through an online process, improves and repairs the properties it purchases, and relists them for sale. Markets are changing folks. People want instant demand. OPEN had a nice runup today but within the next 6 months will be wayyyy better. This is a strong hoousing market play that will shake up the industry. Like uber to taxis. Q4 earning on 4-March-2021. Don't sleep on these guys. Holding long with stocks on this one.

&#x200B;

PLTR. Ive been mentioning this one time and time again. I firmly believe in this company. They have a strong leadership team. They are pulling in big contracts and their financials are looking promising. They havent mooned just yet and I am personally invested in this company. However, I am only mentioning this stock for the potential it has. It is a massive analytic software company that can do amazing things. Their software program combines massive data queries into a seamless almost gamelike visual representation easy for the user to comprehend. Yes they had a nice runup recently do to an IBM partnership. I am holding long with stock since it was $18 and i have LEAPS for Jan 2022.

&#x200B;

A more risky stock with the potential for a large runup is CLOV. If you dont know who Chamath is, he is a legend now and someone i highly respect in the financial world given his background, knowledge, and calling out those hedge funds during the GME debacle. CLOV is a healthcare provider play. Now why is this a risky play? Well with Biden as president of the USA, he plans to decrease medicare eligible age from 65 to 60, I know thats huge. Currently, each week, there are 10,000 new people eligible for medicare. those are some massive numbers, numbering billions added in revenue for the industry. Chamath is on of the major reason behind this stock. He is a person focused on growth. He assisted Facebook back in the early 2000s and look where they are now. His backing of CLOV will put them in the spotlight especially if there are positive changes to medicare (especially since offfering medicare plans is their specialty). Chamath walks the walk and talks the talk. But as always do your own research. I personally invested stock in this company. and i look forward to see where this goes.

&#x200B;

Look at the big picture everyone! Stay positive and ask lots of questions.

&#x200B;

So now what should you do with this information??

TLDR: OPEN, PLTR, CLOV good stocks. DO YOUR OWN DD

Ladder Gang for lyf!! ‚úåÔ∏è‚úåÔ∏è_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ RR.L Rolls Royce Today RR.L showed up in my app's list of 'popular' stocks. This means lots of volume.  
RR's graph shows a year long decline into the dirt. With the start of the pandemic being quite defined in that decline. But the year leading up to the pandemic wasn't great either.

Rolls Royce isn't doing so well. They're losing billions. Their stock is in the dirt, and it looks like people have started picking it up, for dirt cheap.

Some day, the pandemic will fizzle out and air travel will pick up. That will cause the demand for jet engines to pick up, and if RR is still alive by then, their stock should start a recovery.  
If one was to invest in Rolls Royce, this might be the time to yolo in and **hope they don't go bankrupt**. And then wait out the pandemic and hope for their recovery. So basicly, it's a really stupid investment. Unless if it works out, then it's not stupid. If RR survives, they might come out the other end with their fat trimmed, "lean and mean".

Obviously not financial advice. This is merely an observation. If anything, it might just be interesting to watch how low their stock can go._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $TLRY $APHA calls since 1/5/2021 got me to over $500k today.

1. Wall st is dirty and will do ANYTHING to stay in control, no matter the moral or ethical transgressions. Duh, we knew how messed up they are but GME has brought it all to center stage. The financial paradigms are shifting for the better. 

2. Secondly and related is commoner interaction. Wealth inequality is real and only 45% of Americans own stock. This campaign has no doubt moved that percentage up. Whether it's Mark Cuban's son or reigniting stock interest myself more people are playing the game. The game often reserved for fat cats. This is the most beneficial and largest organic educational series I've seen since Pokemon GO single handedly lowered the Body Fat Percentage of chubby kids across America.

But hey I'm no philosopher nor financial adviser. I just like the stock along with a lot of other people. Power to the players._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ My toughts on AMC To start off, im not a financial advisor or anything of the sort. But i honestly believe looking at the pre pandemic stock rates from AMC that they Will peak like crazy once this pandemic is over.

Today, let‚Äôs talk about WKHS & OSK. (xpost r/options) **TL;DR: OSK to the moon üöÄüöÄüöÄ, WKHS to hell üëéüëéüëé**

WKHS is at all time highs, and Reddit loves to pump the stock. Me? I was one of the biggest workhorse bulls with hundreds of shares in my portfolio. I rode the wave until today, where I sold the last of my shares. So... why?

Well, **90% of this company‚Äòs value is based on them getting the USPS deal. People love to think the company is a shoe in for the USPS deal, but that‚Äôs simply not the case.**

For starters, the Biden administration doesn‚Äôt have nearly as much control over the United States Postal Service as you think. See: https://twitter.com/bradplumer/status/1354831900939079680?s=20
Even if Biden‚Äòs number one goal was for the USPS to go all electric, he‚Äôd have to move hell and earth to have any control over that happening. And, with the contract supposedly being decided by the end of March, there simply isn‚Äôt enough time to do that.

But it gets even worse. People say ‚Äúwell, workhorse is the only all electric option, so at least it has that going for it.‚Äú To that, I Bring you a conversation an analyst had with Oshkosh:

> ‚ÄúYour bid is based on the Ford's transit, I believe. And we just heard the announcement of the new Ford e-transit coming out here in 2021. For your comment that you can address whatever the USPS' needs are as far as powertrain, is it as simple as just substituting the transit for the e-transit? Or do you have to have a special reopening of the contract and new approval to kind of make that switch?‚Äù

Oshkosh‚Äôs reply: 

> ‚ÄúSo there's limited things that I can say about this program, not because I don't want to, but because we're under a pretty tight confidentiality with the USPS. We don't have to reopen anything to address the needs as they evolve with the contract. I really can't comment on the transit van because of the confidentiality. But I can say that we don't need to go back and have some arduous task of reopening an agreement if the contract goes one way or another, we will not have to do that.‚Äù

In other words, Oshkosh theoretically has no issue with amending their bid for the contract into a bid including all-electric vehicles. Oshkosh, with their powerful connection with Ford, has all the resources they need to win this contract, and their long track record as a successful company protects their stock from plummeting. Workhorse, on the other hand, is a fledgling company with no infrastructure to build a large number of vehicles and a product that is not particularly unique or special.

Let‚Äôs get to the point: the contract will either be decided by end of March or be delayed once again. Either way, WKHS will likely plummet (like it did the last time the contract was delayed). **Buy mountains of WKHS puts expiring in April. Buy OSK shares or, if you‚Äôre brave like me, calls expiring in April.**

With the small spike in GME (and AMC to lesser extent), it's clear that people are anticipating short interest is still going to be high. Whether or not that will be the truth (or even if the FINRA numbers will be reliable) is another story.


Regardless, the astroturfing and narrative control efforts will be strong, especially if the SI numbers ARE high. For now, just wait, buy, and hold if you're confident in GME. Not financial advice.

Position: 60@77 GME


Edit: Also, SI numbers have NOT been updated yet, so just be patient. 6pm EST seems to be the "expected" time. Those people linking or saying 226.42 SI are wrong, those numbers are not updated and are old.

Just be patient folks.

SPY volume was a fucking *third* of what it normally is today. And for being that low it sure was bouncing around quite a bit. Also right at the end of the day there when that dump happened volume shot up from 25mil to 35mil in less than 5 minutes. every single option bled today right up until the end of the day. Doesn't that usually happen when big institutions are trying to hide the fact that they are switching to the short side? I also noticed for the last hour of the day even tho the ETF was climbing steadily so was the VIX and now right after close that fucker looks like it's moving up at a 90 degree angle. So.....I know that the sentiment here has been üåàüêª r fuk for a looooong time but I went all cash today and bought spy puts yesterday at that big run up before close. Did I pull an autismo move and call the top? Or you guys thinking small pullback maybe a couple % then right back on the call train to tendie town? Or I'm a dumb fuck for buying puts becauy stonks go up and timing the market is fucking impossible.

Well no shit, it‚Äôs something we all try to do. I tried to keep it simple and experimented with EMA and Bollinger Bands.

 One trend that I found over and over again was when I used 5 Day EMA while following the prices day by day.  There were essentially 3 spikes that would happen in the lifespan of a price taking off. First, the 5 EMA would [start by ‚Äúhugging‚Äù the top Bollinger Band](https://imgur.com/axWwcy0) this would be the indicator of one of the three hikes. To confirm this was a real hike and not a dummy, I employed the 2 Day EMA to confirm. In order for it to be confirmed, the 2 Day EMA would need to [break out of the Bollinger Band for roughly 3 trading days](https://imgur.com/bCuJpoh). This was by no means an overall confirmation to invest. The confirmation usually comes 1.5 to 2 months following the first spike when the exact same process happens again. Following the second confirmation we follow the price and make a decision when to jump in just as a dip occurs. We have 100% confidence that a third spike is coming and can ride that into a profit.


Obviously we should not employ this strategy into incredibly volatile stocks but it has been very successful for me thus far. Let‚Äôs take a look at some examples of the 5-2-3 Strategy at work:

&nbsp;

Here is [Netflix in 2015](https://imgur.com/GPPOToX)


Here is [Amazon in 2015](https://imgur.com/zhonAVu)


Here is [NVIDIA in 2017](https://imgur.com/gxdeP9V)


Also some other big investment things that I can't say on this sub have fallen into the 5-2-3 strategy.

&nbsp;

And finally to another recent stock: GME. In late August 2020 [the first spike occurred and was confirmed](https://imgur.com/W3tjDL6), 2.5 months later [the second happened and was confirmed](https://imgur.com/gMyNebx), then the price [took off and probably could‚Äôve topped out at $50-60](https://imgur.com/s4ZY2Lw) but the insanity took hold and the rest is history.

Hope you‚Äôve found this interesting, I‚Äôd love some feedback and opinions on where I could do better!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Did we? _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ When temptation knocks.... HOLD THE FUCKING LINE!!!!! _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ I don't know if I made the hedgies happy or not, but it brought me relief I sold 80% of my GME shares. I have 10 left which I'm holding. I got $2,092 out of the 14k I put in.

I don't know if I played the hand they manufactured or if I came to my senses, but I feel relieved. I crunched the numbers and invested in the cruise industry and realised my profits would make up for my loss. As I'm more certain that the cruising industry will rise again more than GME.

Now, if we're being honest with ourselves I put money into GME because I wanted to get rich quick. And then it turned into wanting to "stick it to the man."

Well, I read a post on here that swayed me the other way with logic I just couldn't ignore. It was something along the lines of "if you know you're fighting a battle that's rigged, why not get out and invest in something that has more of a chance?"

That made the most sense to me out of all the other bullshit posts of people trying to get us to sell.

I may have lost 14k, but once the cruise industry gets back in gear and it goes to it's regular value (or higher) then I'll have made 69k in profit (he he). And while I'm not a millionaire, it's still more money than I realistically need and I can always reinvest part of that profit.

Point is, hold if you want, sell if you want. Do what makes you sleep better at night.

Honestly fuck the hedge funds they'll get their karma one of these days. And if it turns out GME goes up, I still have 10 @ 89.98.

I wanted to share my YOLO story with everyone! (images below text):

I like to think I am one of the biggest ROKU bulls around. Despite following ROKU since the IPO, I had missed most of the gains in 2019. When COVID crash came I said to myself if there was an opportunity to get ROKU again I would scoop it up with every freaking penny I could.

I YOLO with just over 500k in options in April 2020. My strategy was to buy 6 month call option contracts so I could weather any storms, and I did right out of the gate between April to June.

Sold my OCT 17 2020 calls which I bought in April on Oct 17 for 2.3 million. I YOLO that 2.3 million into more 6 month calls expiring in APRIL 2021.

Current market value over $18,000,000 (CAD)

Kicker is - I think ROKU is going to double again this year all day long... I am all in on this play until ROKU is done printing money... Going to 30 million, 50 million then 100 million even if it takes a few years.

Go ROKU!!!

Edit: credit for this content goes to u/BobJohnson2003_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ The Importance of VWAP (part 2) Alright artards, listen up because I'm seeing bullish things.

Last week I wrote a post that looked at the GME chart and various important levels from a volume perspective (and the psychology behind that)....this is a follow up to that post.

Here is that original post:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lahtvs/volume\_based\_ta/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lahtvs/volume_based_ta/)

This second post will be short but I just want to highlight one thing. Take a look at this chart below (or your own) and notice how ever since that faithful day when 5m idiots got boned by Robinhood, price has not closed above VWAP (in this chart normal VWAP is orange and white line is anchored VWAP from the top)

[https://www.tradingview.com/x/eM7wzfj4/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/eM7wzfj4/)

For those that don't know what VWAP is go google it, but in short, it's basically a volume weighted moving average that holds a lot of weight for traders and is an indication of where the balance of power lies within a market trend. As I mentioned, price has failed to close above VWAP since the major high two weeks ago. This is an interesting place for the chart right now because it is fighting with the pretty important $50 level. Why is $50 important? I think it's important because most of you idiots got into this trade above $50 meaning that we might have hit max pain on this trade as everyone is in the red. We will just have to wait and see...

**TLDR: If we hold $50 and finally manage to close above VWAP (today or tomorrow), then the odds tip in our favor for the party to start again. I'm not necessarily convinced that we are going to see this go over $500 but I think we will see a significant bounce and make a lower high relative to the last peak two weeks ago (say, $150/$200 range). Also, major bullish bonus points if we break above the red downtrend line and hold it as support.**

This is not financial advice. Make your own decisions based on your own assessment....i'm just trying to educate people on some TA concepts. I took a 40 share intraday position this morning at $47.80 and I plan to swing it through the night if we close above VWAP. If we fail to take VWAP I will be flat at the close.

&#x200B;

Update: Just made a convincing move above VWAP on big volume. Its about to retest back into it and if it holds thats good.

[https://www.tradingview.com/x/hyDyQ7VX/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/hyDyQ7VX/)

Update: and it failed below. I got stopped out on 30 shares already and unless something miraculous happens into the close I will flatten on the final 10.

Final update on the day:

Ok folks, todays close was really interesting. Take a look at the chart below. About 1 hour before close we were above VWAP and then broke under with about 45 minutes left on the day. Then about 15 min before close we started to climb back up into VWAP but rejected. At that point I closed the rest of my position. LITERALLY at the final 30 seconds of the day we spiked above VWAP and closed above. To me this looked more like a weird liquidity quark rather than a convincing trend change but then the after hours action started and wow...this might get interesting tomorrow. Price just broke the downtrend (red line) and is currently testing as support. I put less weight on this price action as its happening after hours but if it holds that trend and holds VWAP in the first 15 minutes tomorrow then I think we see a big green morning.

[https://www.tradingview.com/x/afcjW5FW/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/afcjW5FW/)

&#x200B;

Back again:

I just want to note that IMO this is the best risk/reward entry point for GME right now. GME closed above VWAP yesterday for the first time since the major peak (granted a bit of a weird close but still got it), then broke, tested, and resumed off of the downtrend support. Then, it fell through VWAP in the AM, held the low of yesterday, and then recovered in a big way. Now it's retesting back down at VWAP (as to be expected). Personally I'm adding here.   


like always not financial advice....do your own research and make your own decisions. get that WAP_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Tonight‚Äôs SI report Tonight‚Äôs report has been built up to be a make or break point for GME. I want to caution my fellow autists from reading too much into this single piece of data. Let‚Äôs start with what we know about tonight‚Äôs report:

1) This report is based on self reported data. 

2) The fine for misreporting, if caught, is pennies on the dollar compared to the costs to cover.

3) The data report covers up until the 29th.

So what are the possible outcomes:

1) Data is accurate, HF covered: I believe at this point GME becomes a long play. There is the potential for an acquisition or a turn around/pivot in the business model. The play is buy (DCA) and hold.

2) Data is accurate, HF did not cover: I believe the play here would be to buy as much as you can. This would push up the price pushing more expiring calls ITM and put further pressure on the HF. We would likely get a significant influx of new investment interest from retail and the squeeze is on. The play is buy and hold.

3) Data is inaccurate: This is the most likely outcome given the money at stake. If it shows they haven‚Äôt covered then there would be no real sense in putting out false data. If it shows they have covered then it becomes a gut call. Personally, the continued bots and media coverage seem to still indicate that something is amiss otherwise why go through all that effort, expense, etc. The play is buy (DCA) and hold.

In all three scenarios buy and hold seems to be the most prudent course of action. The only reason to sell IMHO is if you believe GME will go bankrupt. 

Ok so I‚Äôm going to buy if I can or continue to hold ... what could happen that would turn this around?

1) If not covered, a whale investor or fund deciding to purchase this serving as a catalyst for a true squeeze. Elon, Cuban, another HF, etc. Personally,I have my Tesla in my shopping cart already.

2) If not covered, GME reverse stock split. This could force a true squeeze though likely would not happen until the stock gets back into single digits.

3) If not covered, emergency shareholder meeting. My understanding this would cause a recalling of shares to allow the shareholders to vote, this initiating the squeeze.

4) If covered or uncovered, significant renewed public interest in GME. A lot more likely if uncovered, but it‚Äôs a strange world we live in so I wouldn‚Äôt completely rule it out if they covered.

5) If covered or uncovered, GME public offering of 10 million shares at $x price (we will say $200). This sets a bottom for the stock in the short term, I believe most who are already in the stock would see value in putting billions into the company coffers either for stock support on a cash balance basis or to be a war chest to facilitate the turn around. I am actually a bit puzzled why this hasn‚Äôt already been done.

6) If covered, GME being acquired by a major player at a reasonable price. This would ensure continuing good will from the existing shareholders and would ensure the GameStop name lives on.

7) If covered, GME makes a strategic purchase or alliance that then starts to justify a higher evaluation.

Obviously these are the thoughts of some retarded ape. Full disclosure, I am currently down around 100k in my positions on GME. In my mind, the invested funds were completely lost at the moment of purchase so it doesn‚Äôt bother me to hold forever or until I win, whichever comes first. ü¶çüôåüíéüöÄüåï

Edit: The report is supposed to reflect until the 29th.

 Payday 3 is going to be develeoped and released in 2023, is this too early to talk about it, is it apeshit to bet on a game for profits? 

Price is in krons so market cap is around 140million USD and it was around 50 million USD when raid happened. 

These guys saw they need new engine and they are going on Unreal Engine, i believe it is a great potential, they made the whole payday from stripped down racing engine. 

There has been heads changing in last years and last DLC's on payday2 were the most successful. Company is not profiting yet their share price rose with the success of DLC's, it was 0.5 kron at police raid, 1 kron after things settled down and now pushing high 1.5's. This is %300 with making positive annoucements and a damn DLC.   


What you think, does it make sense to bet on a game? Also for their genre i can only see GTA's heists close and GTA 6 does not seem to be releasing soon. Also for 2 year period, this is not an AAA game but a game that lives with addons, will it be short? Can it suck because it will be underdeveloped?

So some people have addressed NOK before, but it did not really gain much traction because there were not short positions on it.

If you look into some of the material online a lot of media are actually discussing the company's potential and not just for the Reddit traction.

This is IMO one of the more serious stocks on this subreddit and is more geared towards the members, who actually have some knowledge in investing._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Say it with me...R G B. If you are too busy crying about lost tendies and not looking at the $CRSR discount today, you don't deserve money So you could continue to moan and lick your wounds that you didn't become a millionare in 3 days, or you can sack up and make your money back on a surefire play.

Today $CRSR earnings released. The numbers were killer as they have been all year (I'm not going to dive into deep DD on the earnings report itself as other posts have already done),. Future guidance is conservative but still very bullish. 

This stock has everything going for it, yet the price tanked. 

**Why?**

Because its 2021 and every stock is doing the same thing post positive earnings. 

Check out [LOGI](https://imgur.com/D0FoKHV)....earnings call on 1/18, dipped for a day, bounced back to ATH 2 weeks later and climbing fast. 

CRSR is currently at the bottom of that curve right now.

Was it an IV crush? Honestly this morning it was more like a bunch of short-selling in expectations of an IV crush followed by a bunch of panicky paper hands.  It's already up 5% on the day's lows

Every $CRSR financial metric is extremely positive, huge gains over last year.

"But but but /u/dontmicrowavecats , are you sniffing glue? The price of CRSR already rose from $36 to $46, the earnings was already priced in. There will be no moon for you."

No, wrong. Why? Because the price was only at $36 due to pressure from the GME squeeze.

**Citadel owns 2% of the $CRSR Float. On 1/13, the same day GME rose 57% for the first time, CRSR tanked. CRSR was oversold in direct reaction to GME**
https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CRSR/holders?p=CRSR

So the price tanks from $41ish to $36, starts recovering, then CRSR issues a secondary PO for 7.5 million shares...price drops again. 

The stock is currently BARELY trading above the previous averages right now. The entire "runup" to ER wasn't a runup at all, but rather an upward price correction to where it should be.

The stock is still undervalued, and currently trading at a big discount. Today and *possibly* tomorrow will be the best day to buy CRSR you will get.

We are likely going to see $60 within 2 weeks, $70+ soon after that.

[http://finra-markets.morningstar.com/MarketData/EquityOptions/detail.jsp?query=14%3A0P000002CH&sdkVersion=2.58.0](http://finra-markets.morningstar.com/MarketData/EquityOptions/detail.jsp?query=14%3A0P000002CH&sdkVersion=2.58.0)

Hey retards, we are so close to seeing this GME & AMC thing through.

Today there is a very important report coming which will let us know updated numbers on the number of shorts that major hedge funds still have.

**This report will most likely be artificially skewed in an attempt to shake out the rest of the long-term SS holders.**

***How can the report be skewed?*** Say you have 1000 shares in short positions in a company that only has 1000 shares available. That means that your hedge fund has a 100% short interest in that company. Say, some random trove of wandering monkeys notice that your hedge fund has 100% short interest in that company, and you and your billionaire friends are all spooked because there aren't enough shares for those monkeys to buy (the short squeeze narrative). What do you do?

You somehow have to amass enough shares to drive that short interest percent down, because you want to appear that you've closed your short positions and scare the monkeys away. So this is what you do. You buy 800 shares in long positions (using call options), and suddenly the short interest is only 20%. You have made it appear that your hedge fund is no longer unreasonably short on that stonk.

&#x200B;

**HOWEVER, YOU HAVE STILL NOT CLOSED YOUR SHORT POSITION!** You still have to buy back all of those shorted stocks, and you've effectively thrown a rug over the giant shit stain in the middle of the room. It's worth it for you to do this though, because the monkeys who are expecting a moon will paper-hand and stop the short squeeze from being as severe.

&#x200B;

What does this mean? Hold, despite what the report says. If the report shows high SI, then the hedgies are actually 100% boned and have not even had enough time and/or money to offset that SI number. That's huge. If the report shows low SI, HODL. The big players simply have not had enough volume to cover all their short positions, and are trying to manipulate us into thinking the MOASS was a hoax.

Prices at time of writing:

* **TLRY** - 42.39

* **APHA** - 23.19


**Background:** Tilray (TLRY) and Aphria (APHA) are two companies based in Canada that sell marijuana. A few years ago both of these companies went to the moon, especially TLRY which reached $300 a share before crashing back down. 


**Current Catalysts**

*Merger:* Recently they announced a merger, set to finalize this year. The combined company will trade under the TLRY name and ticker, but APHA is acquiring TLRY. Those holding APHA will get ~0.84 shares of the new company (TLRY) for each APHA share they hold.

*Arbitrage gap:* Both companies have skyrocketed since announcing the merger, boosted by other news such as the Dem majority, Biden's election, and opening new deals in the UK. Oddly, TLRY has outpaced APHA, leading to a massive gap in share price. At the 0.84 share conversion APHA shares should be currently trading at $35.60. 

*Market share/Cap:* The combined TLRY/APHA will be the largest weedstock in the world by sales, with one of the highest margins as well. However, they are currently undervalued compared to CGC, the largest weedstock by market cap, by about 5 billion dollars, or ~50% of their current market cap. You may remember CGC was awarded a 5 billion dollar investment a few years back by Constellation Brands.

**Future Catalysts**

* Merger - Not finalized, but very likely to be finalized soon

* Partnership - Likely, as they will be the largest company and have the largest global footprint. Who the partner will be is unknown, but it is likely that they get one

* US Legalization - Dems could hold this up, but all signs point to reform coming

* US Banking reform - This will allow all sorts of money to flow into the sector that is current prohibited because marijuana is still illegal at the federal level

**Stupid Questions I keep seeing**

* No, this isn't like last time. When TLRY went to $300 it was shorted 33%. It is currently shorted 50% and has actual catalysts and sales behind it now

* The price looks different on Canadian tickers because they trade in Canadian dollars. It is still the same company

* If you own APHA, when the merger comes you will get 0.84 TLRY shares for each APHA share. It is that simple. If it isn't an even number you get some cash back. If you own calls, the calls will be bundles of 84 shares instead of 100. Seriously, this isn't hard math

* Yes they can still run, they are undervalued compared to CGC and the US market is bigger than Canada, UK, and Germany combined.

* Yes they can still drop. If I knew for certain it was going up I'd have more than 500 shares and be much less poor

* TLRY could drop to close the gap, or APHA could rise. No one knows which will happen. APHA is likely the safer play at this point, as it is cushioned by the gap in share price.

Verizon, Centurylink, AT&T, Frontier Communications

None have increased in price since 1999. Only Verizon is near its peak in 99; AT&T is half the price it was then. Centurylink is 1/5th the price. Frontier is 1/500th the price.

All of these companies have something in common: They all own Bell's old wireline assets. And they've done nothing with them. For the twenty five years or so they've held them.

These companies are, collectively, the biggest service providers for rural "broadband" (it's an oxymoron) in the United States. They are also all reporting dwindling landline subscribers year over year, due in large part to the poor service and poor price point for a service that no longer works as well as it once did, due to crumbling copper infrastructure and failed (and/or refusal to commit to) fiber replacement.

Verizon and AT&T have both offered very substantial dividends for years (and received hundreds of billions in taxpayer subsidy) as opposed to reinvesting those billions of dollars into necessary upgrades to infrastructure and maintenance. They have also reported consistent layoffs of technical personnel in every passing year. I suspect Centurylink and Frontier have reported the same. Great way to pad balance sheets in failing companies!

Now, Verizon and AT&T both own wireless systems; Verizon being the self-proclaimed 'largest nationwide provider.' But there's a problem here for both of them. T-Mobile is blowing them out of the water in urban areas with faster speeds and truly unlimited data, and in rural areas, where they have a stranglehold, the ROI is not very good. To make matters worse, competitors like Starlink, and later, OneWeb and Project Kuiper, are coming online and the telcos are not prepared to compete against them in their rural regions.

The fact that both AT&T and Verizon attempted (and more or less failed) to move into the media sphere with acquisitions over the years seems to imply they weren't very interested in staying telecommunications companies. In fact, I believe their goal, long term - and there are articles supporting this out there - was to let the old ATM/copper network rot completely, and become solely wireless companies. No more unlimited data landlines, no more telephone subscribers. That's a much bigger chunk of their current revenue than people may realize.

If these companies keep losing ground in urban areas, they will face insurmountable monetary challenges in the next decade due largely in part to their own hubris. They figured wireless would be the solution to everything, but as it turns out, if you don't run fiber to the farmland, wireless might as well be dial-up.

**tl;dr** The telcos are quickly running out of time and resources to make up for their mistakes over the last twenty years. If they don't act soon, it will be lights out._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Anyone look into Walmart recently? Walmart and gap to meet with president biden to discuss bailouts and free money

There is no doubt that equities are in a huge bubble that will keep being propped by the money printers in the DC and Bussels. So why waste it hoping to go from -10% to 0% profit?

There's a little thing called opportunity cost. Selling at a loss sucks, but it can be the profitable move. If you hold a stock because it's at a loss until it hits X in Y months you will likely have less money than if you sell now, re-invest it and hit 30% on whatever you know is going up (weed, TESLA, renewables, online gambling, pretty much anything except treasuries right now).

Are there bots and shills here? Undoubtedly there were, maybe there even still is. At most I think 10% of the participants are/were bots or hired trolls. But what those guys do most is amplify the worst we have to offer on either side of this stock to set the tone. After that ball is in motion the shills and bots and trolls could walk away and we'd keep burning for weeks.

Consider this a social short squeeze. A bunch of newcomers here and give OGs short fuses. Then some outside actors come in and applies leverage to the friction between new and old users. Finally, OGs will squeeze GME holders into becoming social pariahs. And before you know it your own private portfolio has become a badge of shame. Regardless of everything else, *this* squeeze I'm describing *has* squoze.

So what can we do to get back into the good graces of our gracious, yet strained hosts? 

* Stop being a dork.  
* Stop clogging the sub with low-effort bullshit
* Stop flexing, 
* Stop acting like a junkie, e.g. "YoU HoLdInG?"
* Stop using the wrong fucking flair, (for fucks sake it's not hard!)

And here's what you can start doing instead:

* Learn what other people are interested in
* Listen in on other DDs for other tickers
* Participate in discussions outside of GME, broaden your horizons
* Laugh at your own stupid mistakes
* Step outside of the GME threads and into others. Integrate with the community

Listen, hold your GME if that's what you want to do. Only you know your current situation and risk tolerances. I'm still holding, but I'm diversifying, and I'll be putting some of my gains from other investments into GME to lower my cost average. 

I don't think anyone here really wants you to sell GME. Instead, I think they want you to shut the fuck up about it. At least for now, while it's doing nothing of real interest.

Read and write your own GME DD based on numbers instead of vitriol. If and when GME flies again, be cool about it. Be quiet about it. And post the biggest fucking gains this sub has ever seen. 

Mods, I think we can get rid of the GME daily threads for a while. They currently only attract trolls and weak minded people who need constant reinforcement. I think it's time GME gang learns to stand on the merits of their own investments instead of huddling around each other like penguins in the long dark antarctic winters.

**TLDR: I believe DoorDash (DASH) is the greatest short opportunity of the year, and what‚Äôs more, rather than just having a general feeling, there are specific timetables enabling us to profit bigly. The company even admits themselves that they have peaked as a company.**    
    
# Analysis:
    
>‚ÄúFood delivery with third-party apps like Grubhub and Uber Eats is booming, but no one's making money.‚Äù ‚Äì Business Insider.    
    
DoorDash is wildly overvalued. This is true by any metric, were it in essentially any industry. Add to that its in food delivery, which is a horrific, no margin industry in what has become a commoditized business and offers essentially no differentiation with its competitors.  There is near zero differentiation between Uber Eats, Postmates, Caviar, Grubhub, DASH, or any local provider. In Austin we have Favor, for example. And nobody cares which company delivers their food, they only care which one does it cheapest.     
    
If you view stock (as you should) as buying the entire business as an owner, how much would you be willing to pay for an undifferentiated company in a no margin commoditized business that has peaked (see below for more on that)? Because it‚Äôs currently selling for an insane $56 billion. Outrageous.    
    
So how can we get a banana for scale to understand what that $56 billion means in terms of valuation?    
    
Well, all of DoorDash‚Äôs competitors have either sold at or are trading at, or raised money at, a capitalization of 3x to 6x sales. **DASH is trading at an absolutely insane 20+ x sales.**    
    
Just six months ago [Postmates was acquired for $2.65 billion](https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/06/uber-takes-out-postmates) which put it at 4x sales. **At 4x sales, DASH would trade at $32.**    
    
DASH used to be the business leader in this industry, but over the past 2-3 years Grubhub has exploded in size to take on nearly the same 33% of market share, and after Uber Eats bought Postmates, it too now has about a third of market share. So you now have three giants of roughly equal size battling it out in a business in which customers don‚Äôt give a motherloving frick about branding.    
    
### But don‚Äôt take my word for it on valuation, take smart money‚Äôs word    
    
[DoorDash raised money just a couple months ago at a $16 billion valuation](https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/18/after-ipo-delays-doordash-confirms-400m-raise/#:%7E:text=DoorDash%20has%20confirmed%20that%20it,money%20valuation%20of%20%2416%20billion). That is truly a stunning fact. In just a few months the WSB type day trading call buyers have bid this company all the way up to $56 billion from $16 billion without any material change to the business and completely ignoring the coming vaccine-induced reopening of restaurants. Again, the stock trades for a 300% markup to its recent smart money capital raise based on nothing but unfounded hopium.     
    
You don‚Äôt have to take my word for it, your beloved Jim Cramer has even said the same thing, in his own idiotic, covering my ass, round about say nothing way. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs true that people using market orders took DoorDash to levels that maybe ... were far higher than they thought they‚Äôd have paid.‚Äù - Jim Cramer    
    
I don‚Äôt care about his commentary, but you people seem to love him, so there you go. üòò      
    
## The Company, according to The Company, has peaked. It‚Äôs over.     
    
There are two extremely interesting things buried in the S-1 we‚Äôre going to get into in a moment. One of them is that you don‚Äôt have to take my word for it that this company‚Äôs business has peaked. **The company says so itself in its own S-1.**   
      
>The circumstances that have accelerated the increase in Total Orders stemming from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic may not continue in the future, and we expect the growth rate in Total Orders to decline in future periods.    
    
To put it simply, COVID numbers are falling, vaccines are rolling out at an impressive 1-2 million per day which puts our stated goal of 100 million vaccinated in 100 days within attainable reach. The economy will be opening up, people will want to be getting out of the house, restaurants will be reopening, and there will be huge pent up demand by people who have had extraordinarily high savings rates over the last year. Big chains will no longer have the need to get help from third party delivery apps at a 15% markup. We all know this is the case, and DoorDash even stated as much in its own filing. This stock is toast.

## And Now the Fun Part     
    
There are some wild share lockup expirations coming up. For those that don‚Äôt know, when you get these massive IPOs, insiders aren‚Äôt actually able to sell their shares on IPO day. They are locked up and the insiders just have to hope for the best that the stock will not lose value over the coming months. If the stock skyrockets in value, but the insiders know the business is trash or has peaked, you get the perfect recipe for a rush for the exits.     
    
I love playing share lockups. I make a lot of money on them by selling spreads. A common question I get when I post them here is ‚Äúif you know a drop is coming, why doesn‚Äôt the market just price it in?‚Äù The answer is because it can‚Äôt. No matter what the share price does, the lockup expiration date is the lockup expiration date. Insiders have to wait until that date, and it doesn‚Äôt matter whether the stock falls 0%, 5%, or 50%, they will all have to wait until that day to sell.     
    
DoorDash has two share lockup expirations coming.     
    
The first lockup expiration is an early release (heh) and hits 90 days after the Dec. 9 IPO, or around March 9, as long as the stock trades 25% higher than the IPO price for five out of 10 consecutive days of trading.  That is to say, so long as DASH trades above $127.50 right before March 9, the lockup is triggered. The good news for you with this insane run up in price is that if the lockup isn‚Äôt triggered, it means the stock has already fallen from $190 to $127. It‚Äôs important to know March 9 is not a hard date exactly...some insiders can be allowed to go a few days prior. Also if they release earnings early the lockup could potentially occur at the end of this month.    
    
I was talking to some folks on WSB about the lockup last week, and someone mentioned they thought only 20% of insider shares will be eligible. DoorDash's management and board members can sell up to 20% of their shares in that first wave, but other insiders can sell up to 40%. This means 113 million shares are eligible for sale in early lockup expiration. DoorDash‚Äôs daily volume is only 3-4 million shares. The current public float is roughly 123 million shares. This means you‚Äôre about to suddenly double the number of shares on the market.     
    
Door Dash‚Äôs second lock-up expiration hits either 180 days after its IPO, which means around June 9 (more or less), or after the release of its first-quarter earnings report (whichever is earlier), and will free up ‚Äúall remaining shares‚Äù according to the S-1, which if my math is correct is roughly 50 million shares.     
    
These two expirations could spark violent sell-offs throughout the year.    
    
## Positions     
    
### FDs
        
I never buy FDs. I‚Äôve never once bought them in my entire life. But I‚Äôm putting 1% of my portfolio into them on DASH because I‚Äôm confident big drops are coming. Unfortunately for you guys, the stock has already started falling this past month from its ü§°-level highs in the $200s, and worse yet the pricing/IV of all options has gotten more expensive. This means, I‚Äôm sorry to say, that you‚Äôre not going to find any options trading for pennies, or even anything less than $2. For your FDs, I recommend you buy puts at whatever the lowest strikes are that actually have any volume. The strikes go as low as $75, but most days show 0 volume and of course the bid/ask spread is enormous. There has been some volume at $95 recently, and you can get the $75s if you‚Äôre patient enough and willing to pay up for them. Expiration dates would be any time in mid to late March (again, looking for whatever has volume) so that it occurs after lockup 1, and the August 20s, which unfortunately are the closest expiration to the lockup occurring around June 9. I wish there was a closer expiration, but hey, more time for the stock to collapse. Plus you could always sell your puts after the June 9 drop with lots of theta meat still left on the bone.     
    
### Puts
I own March 12 $160 puts. I think the stock will drop healthily below this, but IV is high. I‚Äôm normally taking big swings with spreads, so when I buy puts outright, which is rare, I want to play it a little safer.    
    
I also own the August 20 $145 puts.     
    
And finally, I have six figure credit call spreads open at the $175 level. For newbies, this simply means I:    
Bought (yes bought) the March 12 $175 calls, and     
Sold the $172.50 calls.    
    
I went huge on these because all I need is for DoorDash to trade below $172.50 after the lockup expiration and I‚Äôll be having a Merry Christmas. That‚Äôs as close to risk free gains as you‚Äôre ever going to see in your life.    
    
### Bull case    
The only bull case is that we‚Äôre in a raging, record-setting bull market and all stonks go up. The economy is opening back up, vaccines are rolling out, and stonks go up. But I think if you look at the DASH chart you can see that that is already starting to not be the case.    
    
### What are the negatives?    
I plagiarized liberally [from an old Citron Research report](https://citronresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/DoorDash-The-Most-Ridiculous-IPO.pdf), although it doesn‚Äôt even mention share lockups. Yes, that Citron. For those of you who are newer members, I will tell you this; the little smart money social circles in and around WSB do not hate CItron, Hindenburg, or any other short selling firms. We respect them and welcome bearish cases on high flying stocks. Any intelligent trader does. It‚Äôs only the pump and dumpers who have a hatred for short reports. You should welcome contrarian views.    
    
### Parting Words.   
I would welcome anyone pointing out where they think I may be wrong. I don‚Äôt care about saving face, I care about not losing money. If I‚Äôm wrong, I want to know it. I welcome constructive criticism.    

## Give Me One More TLDR At The End    
This stock is going to collapse because it‚Äôs wildly overvalued, employees got in super cheap with shares they are waiting to sell, know the business has peaked, and they want to cash the fahk out. So swallow the high IV and buy puts today as fast as you can.

Buy the dip or HODL; don't go out with losses now!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Is everyone aware the Short Interest report is from the Jan 29th SETTLEMENT Date, not Jan 29th Trade Date? I know a lot of people are still holding out hope for this report to save them or re-ignite momentum.

Just before it does come out I wanted to check that people understand what it is reporting.

The Settlement date of a stock is T+2, basically 3 business days.

So Just so everyone understands, that means the only thing you'll see is trading up to January 27th.

So up to that moment it had not actually hit the highest point, which occurred on the 28th, and for many firms they'd only receive their margin call after the close of the 27th, not during the day.  

So I'm just putting that out there, control your expectations and think ahead about what you expect to hear before it comes out 'cause i think emotional thinking will overwhelm some people at that point.

It is extremely likely you will still see a very high short interest, likely still over 100%, possibly even higher than 140%.So please be aware that this is BEFORE the price maxed, that a large percentage of those companies will have had to close their positions the very next day when the stock tripled in value, but that will not be reflected here.The specific hedge funds everyone is completely obsessed with also claimed to close their positions after Wednesday. This report is as of Tuesday, you will not be able to use it to confirm a conspiracy theory that they lied.

So do with the information what you will, I still expect some people to weave it into conspiracy theories, but at least know what the information in terms of the dates it covers.

Disclaimer: very high IVs on everything on the option chain. This was one of the memestonks from the GME era, which drew down very quickly. For those interested, short % of float is around 33% so this is not going to be a GME squeeze. 

Not going to talk about politics either because yes that is a major factor. You can go to plenty of other boards to see when Kamala will make the special agriculture ~~mandatory~~ legal. There are much better other stocks within this green ecosystem, but don't show this kind of massive inflow into the highest strikes (so lots of pent up demand, which in turn should drive the delta and gamma higher). 

So here it is. For the non-YOLO July 2021 and Jan 2022, the $4 strike (33% higher than the $3 which is a big jump) is getting around 5-6x of the volume today. Similarly on the OI, there's a lot of people buying. 

Yes, once higher strikes on chain are introduced, there might be a drop in interest in the $3 and $4. However, that's not to say there will be even more demand for the cheaper $5s and higher strikes, once again driving the gamma machine.

We get new short interest numbers today after market close, if this is still above 80% I believe we‚Äôll see a rebound. So I‚Äôll keep holding

Position: 107 shares & 15 AMC $20c 2/26 contracts. And 45 GME @ $80.12 avg, holding out there too

Edit: stop telling me to sell. I‚Äôm not a pussy and would rather lose 100% than sell and admit I made a mistake

Glad ur starting to realize how movie theaters work. But people keep paying for that overpriced popcorn and sit in those seats. This is not financial advice but, if people miss that stale popcorn and overpriced candy (candy the real cash cow here) once C*vid is over, maybe it‚Äôll go back up. And the more bag holders there are, and the more hedges short, the higher likelihood we see a short squeeze in the future. Maybe.

So far I have already opened accounts with WeBull, Fidelity, ETrade, & Schwab. The problem I'm running into, and I guess it's a minor annoyance in the big scheme of things, is that I like Robinhood's app so much better than the others. I basically only deal with options and all of the other apps seem to be rather clunky in comparison to Robinhood.   


Is there someone else doing it as well as Robinhood that I just haven't tried yet?

Being an IT person, their products are best in class and rock solid. They also sell routers & switches as well as a ticketing platform for IT departments/companies. When they first launched their IPO a few months ago, I bought some shares and have been following them since. Their network equipment reminds me of Cisco Meraki, just at the very beginning of their launch(I did the same w/ Ubiquiti $UI, and have rode it from $55 to $350/share).

They are about to release their 2nd earnings report on 3/11. This is where I found a pretty good options play. Share price is roughly $24.87-$25 right now, and the 3/19 call options at $22.50 is trading around $4. This means the stock only has to rise to $26.50 or $1.63 during their earnings report timeframe to win on this. Given this is their 2nd earnings release(their first one was right around their IPO, so it was pretty buried), if they have good news, this could be a big winner. I believe the $20 call options may have an even smaller gap to cross, likely closer to $25.75, or $1.10.

&#x200B;

The bonus is that their equipment is generally sold in contracts, so the likelihood of them having a poor quarter is minimal. I have bought call options and own shares. Not financial advice, I just like the stonk.

One day a very clever fish convinced a bunch of retarded fish to buy tickets for this meal and hold on to them which increased the price exponentially. The retarded fish could then sell the tickets back to the Snakes making a profit. 

Soon enough all the other fish in the sea heard about this Game and came to help. But by then it was too late, the price of a meal ticket was more than any little fish could afford.

The Snakes seeing this plan had succeeded in almost bankrupting them did a cunty spineless move and sold tickets between themselves to make the price of a ticket go down, so the retarded fish couldn‚Äôt put them out of business.

The retarded fish were obstinate and they continued to hold onto their meal tickets despite the price going down. ever so slowly, ever so painfully as many of the fish who got in late lost money and sold off their tickets. 

Some retarded fish thought they could make the price go up again by buying more but this was ineffectual as the activity of the Snakes was too much and more and more fish each day were giving up and selling their tickets to make some cash back and feed their fishwives and retarded fish children.

Silly fish thought a smart snail watching from the sidelines, if only the retarded fish could see that if they stopped buying more tickets and let the big fish who bought lots of tickets sell one at a time, the price would lower so more fish could buy even more tickets. Eventually the Snakes wouldn‚Äôt have any tickets to sell between themselves.   

The smart snail offered to help the retarded fish defeat the Snakes by delivering a clever strategy for success. ‚ÄúGo away crazy snail, that would never work,‚Äù said the retarded fish. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt want the Snakes out of business we just want to buy tickets.‚Äù Stupid retard fish they thought the game was only about buying and holding tickets.

If only the retarded fish would stop sending each other memes and sucking each other‚Äôs dicks all day they might actually take over the Big Meal Business, if only they could see that it was them who had all the numbers they needed to swarm the Snakes and take all the tickets from them and their would be nothing the Snakes could do about it in time.

Poor Retarded Fish, thought the smart snail, guess they‚Äôll never learn, I guess now they‚Äôll always be Poor Retarded Fish. (sigh)

&#x200B;

**My Own Thoughts (my own opinion and not financial advice)**

**-** I believe this was a blowout quarter. Taking a look at page 42 of the 8-K filing, we can see that Gamer and Creator Peripherals revenue grew 83% in 2020 year-over-year to $539 million. In Q4 2020 alone, Gamer and Creator Peripherals revenue grew 104% year-over-year to $192 million. Overall revenue in 2020 grew 55% year-over-year to $1.702 billion, while in Q4 alone revenue grew by 70% year-over-year to $556 million.

\- There were expansions of gross margin in both segments (gamer and creator peripherals, and gaming components and systems). Gamer and creator peripherals gross margin has expanded to 35% from 31% in 2018, while gaming components and systems gross margin has expanded to 24% from 17% in 2018. **The fact that gross margin in the components and systems segment improved by 700 bps during that time period in a market that has notoriously low margins tells me that the marketing of Corsair‚Äôs products as premium quality, is working and that customers are choosing the higher priced items over lower priced competitor items.** Corsair was also able to expand margin by engaging in less promotional activities which means that consumers most definitely choosing Corsair‚Äôs higher priced products over lower-cost competitors due to a variety of reasons such as build quality and brand loyalty. 

\- I was extremely impressed with the improvement of the Gamer and Creator Peripherals gross profit by 133% year-over-year, which it seems was led by their Elgato streaming products for streamers and content creators. The margins are much higher in this area than in components and streamer customers seem to regard Elgato products with high enthusiasm.

\- Adjusted EBITDA tripled in 2020 to $213 million which it seems can be attributed to an explosion of demand for Corsair‚Äôs products by customers who are spending more time at home working and gaming._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ A delisted stock and some late plays...Turns out, I am the meme. _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ You know what they say, always get more aggressive rather than defensive when you start to lose money. _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Aphria/Tilray Merger Second time posting this. Made it last night but other than a collab between CGC and APHA, news about the merger seems to be the same this morning.

This is my first DD so please bare with me in case I set something up wrong; I'm happy to edit if so but this took me a while to gather.

I just joined this sub about two weeks ago amidst the GME hype. I've been investing for a few years now ever since the Tilray IPO at $17. Bought, sold, and reinvested consistently (pulling out my principal each time) right up through the almost $300 peak and backed out. I left Tilray alone for a while until recently when the news regarding the merger with Aphria started popping up because I actually love Aphria and I've owned it for a while now, so I wanted to post some DD regarding the merger. Hope this helps some of you.

**For the business:** Reverse merger is taking place where Aphria is absorbing Tilray and will own 63% of the company, continuing to use the name Tilray due to better brand recognition and its nearly eponymous representation of the cannabis market. Aphria has a strong presence in Germany which is the only European country with medical marijuana, so Aphria has an advantage in that sector for if/when other European nations start following suit. With both Aphria's and Tilray's international relations along with slowly migrating into the US they may grow into the largest cannabis company worldwide just in terms of revenue.

Over the previous 12 months, Aphria put up $443 million USD in revenue compared to Canopy Growth's $377m USD. Tilray has put up $201m USD in the last 12 months, and which combined with Aphria is $644m USD, or markedly higher than the $377m USD posted by the "industry standard," Canopy Growth. (I don't hate on Canopy as a company whatsoever I just think they're overvalued and their stock should not be in the $40s).

Stats from the merger indicated a $685 million annual revenue, adjusted for combined sales, and the company itself, named Tilray, will have a roughly $3.5 billion valuation.

Also, many forget that Tilray has a business partnership with Anheuser-Busch and Aphria owns the craft beer company SweetWater. (Which, personally, is fucking delicious.)

**For the shareholder:** Each Aphria share will convert to 0.8381 shares of Tilray. As of today (Monday, 02/08/21) the closing price of Tilray was $30.09 and the price of Aphria was $18.98. In accordance to the **1 : .8381** conversion rate, the implied price of Aphria is $25.22, which has a 33% upside compared to the current share price.

I don't know the current borrowing rates (if anyone does please feel free to comment), but in January of 2019 the shorting cost for Tilray was above 900% and has been known to remain very high on this stock, as after it's $300 rally a couple years ago it became a favorite among the shorts. There is a way in which to capitalize on the merger by being long on Aphria and short Tilray, but the 30% profit may be outweighed by the crazy high costs of borrowing.

The two biggest risks appear to be the possibility that Aphria shares will crash days before the merger, or that that Tilray has simply been overvalued this entire time and its share price will fall. (*The strategy is listed in the sources here* [*https://seekingalpha.com/article/4404265-tilray-aphria-30-merger-arbitrage-is-tough-to-play*](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4404265-tilray-aphria-30-merger-arbitrage-is-tough-to-play) *& here* [*https://seekingalpha.com/article/4401101-aphria-and-tilray-option-strategy-enhances-returns-and-mitigates-losses*](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4401101-aphria-and-tilray-option-strategy-enhances-returns-and-mitigates-losses) *but you can only open the articles once without a subscription*

**For everyone:** The general consensus on both stocks is bullish, however, more focus is placed on buying into Tilray than Aphria, seemingly just due to the belief that people may jump ship days before Aphria shares are converted into Tilray (even though Aphria still owns the operation). The company will also have easy access into the United States as our president restructures drug scheduling, so moving forward, I feel that Tilray is going to be a strong global competitor in the cannabis industry for some time

I try not to go balls deep on anything that has a lot of hype on it, but Tilray made me BANK right when I first started investing a few months before Canada legalized so I may be biased. However, as objectively as I can be, I do think this merger is both a very strong short and long option.

I don't really know if it's a necessary disclaimer or a joke but I'm gonna go ahead and say no, none of this is financial advice.

Edit 2:  Added the following list below of supporting info for legalizing marijuana nationwide.

A trio of U.S. senators has given investors the green light to invest in  marijuana stocks, an endorsement that suggests the volatile sector might finally  blossom into something as acceptable and regulated as alcohol.

More details will emerge when Sens. Cory Booker (D., N.J.),  Ron Wyden, (D., Ore.), and Chuck Schumer (D.,  N.Y.) introduce legislation to legalize and tax marijuana.

"In the early part of this year, we will release a unified discussion draft  on comprehensive reform to ensure restorative justice, protect public health and  implement responsible taxes and regulations," they announced Feb.  1 in a joint statement.

The marijuana sector has, naturally, advanced higher. The sector proxy, the  ETFMG Alternative Harvest exchange- traded fund , has seemingly entered a new,  higher trading range. The ETF holds 35 stocks, including Aphria(APHA) , Canopy Growth(CGC) , and GW Pharmaceuticals(GWPH) . The fund has about  $1.4 billion under management, which makes it the largest ETF  that targets the global cannabis industry.

In anticipation of the pending legislation, and in an attempt to harness the  momentum of other investors, aggressive investors can consider buying ETFMG  Alternative Harvest. The ETF is trading near a record high, but an options  strategy can potentially reshape the price.

With the ETF at $27.82, investors can sell the March  $25 put option for $1.90 and buy the March  $29 call option for about $2.80. The "risk  reversal" -- selling a put and buying a call with a higher strike price but  similar expiration -- positions investors for agreeing to buy the ETF at  $25 and for participating in gains above $29.

If the ETF is at $35 at March expiration, the call is worth $6.

The trade's risk is predicated on the pending legislation. The trade obligates investors to buy the stock at $23, or to cover the put  or roll the position, if the stock price is below the strike price at  expiration. For that reason, only do this trade if you have the resources and  willingness to buy the ETF at a lower price and a belief in marijuana's pending  legalization. If something happens in Washington that derails marijuana legalization  efforts, the trade falls apart.

Still, the trade is a good way for investors to gain exposure to the  legalization of marijuana, which seems like a good bet as federal government  contends with massive deficits caused by the 2007-09 financial crisis and the  Covid-19 pandemic.

The ETF was chosen over component stocks to potentially reduce the investment  risk that is inherent in picking stocks in an unusual sector with companies that  have a history of extraordinary price volatility.

During the past 52 weeks, the ETF has ranged from $8.81 to  $27.90. The fund gained about 45% over the past year and is up  some 67% this year. The percentage returns seem stellar, but it is important to  remember that the fund has advanced off a low price, and that many of the  components weren't much better situated. The sector could be facing a critical  moment, and this trade puts investors into the center of the industry with a  strategy that can be reset as each month passes.

Fight censorship with censorship-proof technology. üòá_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $UMC and other ‚Äúless glamorous‚Äù semi-conductor manufacturers will likely do well in the coming months With stock shortages on many different nodes from the likes of Samsung, TSMC and even Intel (which has a very dominate position in the server-space), there have been problems getting various products to market. Entire automative factories have been shut-down due to constraints on on getting chips in their vehicles. This phenomenon was predicted to be less unrelenting, but recently, many manufacturers (particularly Microsoft regarding the Xbox Series X) have basically admitted that they simply can‚Äôt sell their products due to the limits on chips designer‚Äôs limits of wafers of a given process node.

As a rundown, Intel, TSMC are the ‚Äúbig fabs‚Äù that you hear about in advanced computing technology. AMD uses TSMC, but AMD is on a 4-front battle with its console, desktop CPU, server CPU, and GPU market, as well as mobile chips. Essentially, any company in the position of AMD (even Intel and Nvidia are facing this problem) that can sell its products like hotcakes, but can‚Äôt get the nodes they need for their top-of-the-line products is bound by what they ordered months or years in advance. It is very likely that this will resonate as a prime reason to use lesser-utilized nodes by other companies for various other components (Internet-of-things, 5G etc...)

Essentially, chip *designers* are being constrained by their ability to gain access to various chips. But the fabs behind these ‚Äúbig-name‚Äù computing technology companies that you‚Äôre used to hearing about are essentially bidding with eachother for these same advanced process nodes, kicking smaller (and by *smaller* I don‚Äôt mean *small*, I mean literally anyone that isn‚Äôt trying to +1 extremely advanced computing products).

TSMC is producing process nodes that perform very well. Except, their supply is very limited. Keep in mind, Chip *designers* will often times outsource their designs to be made on different nodes. Intel uses TSMC, even though it has its own fabs, for instance. And Intel also rents out their own fabs.

This is where $UMC and various other lesser-known semi-conductor manufacturers come in. They will likely fill the massive demand for *any* process node that chip designers can get their hands on to fill the unprecedented shortages which seem to be pushed back farther and farther.

Eventually, your average, run-of-the-mill devices will need chips in them, and they are likely to have difficulties working with more well-renowned chip-makers to actually put their architectures on a given node. In general, chip-manufacturers have had the lion‚Äôs share of consistent performance over the past year due to increasingly innovative products from high-profile designers. It‚Äôs quite possible many device-manufacturers will opt not to use larger semi-conductor fabs as big-names like AMD, NVidia, and even Apple are competing for the same nodes.

At the very least, a lot of the previous success of semi-conductor manufacturers and chip designers may potentially trickle down to lesser-utilized and less glamorous fabs.

There‚Äôs already a precedent that very specialized chip designs will often go to these manufacturers, and now that the big names literally are fighting for these advanced nodes, many chipmakers have used Global Foundries and other ‚Äúless sexy‚Äù fabs to meet demand for chips that they *need* now.

In general, companies with semiconductor fabs are likely to do well, simply due to the fact that the world in general needs more wafers, substrates etc... as infrastructure becomes more complex, digitally.

I recommend researching semi-conductor manufacturers who have long been underdogs.

There has been a tier 1 KILLSWITCH operation aiming to make GME disappear. And for many, it worked.

No longer is GME on the lips of every mother and father in the beautiful United States.

No longer is it the meme of the week, they want us to move on, forget about the stock, forget our fallen comrades at level 300, 400, 450...

We cannot manipulate the market by telling our community what WE (ourselves) are doing... yet... Main Street players and Jim Cramer and the likes go on national television to brag about how they manipulated the markets to make profit knowing the SEC won't do shit.

This is absolute bullshit. The only and safest thing I can do is hold my shares. ^(\*you do you, this is only what I am doing and this is not recommended nor is it financial advice.)

Nothing.

I am only writing this to find the ears of my fellow R-tards across the world who grow weak on this battlefield. We are bombarded by days of attrition. But do not waver my lads. This is only the beginning.

AMC didn't get bought again like all my other stocks did which is sketchy but it's okay I'll just buy it again but no wait my instant access is denied until my money fully deposits in 4-5 business days and I cannot open any new positions until then but if that's the case why was I able to buy all my other stocks and not AMC

So stop gnawing on your crayons for a second and pay attention.

First off, quick summary for people who can read an 8-K. If you only understand üöÄüöÄüöÄ , don't worry, I explain it in more detail with more emojis.

**TL;DR:** PTON just finalized sales of convertible notes and they're using $71M from the proceeds to buy call options on themselves to negate any dilutionary effects. They state in their 8-K  that the option counterparty is going to be buying PTON stock IMMEDIATELY to hedge risk. However you cut it, that's likely 300k-1M+ shares that need to be bought this week.

[https://investor.onepeloton.com/news-releases/news-release-details/peloton-interactive-inc-announces-pricing-upsized-offering-8750](https://investor.onepeloton.com/news-releases/news-release-details/peloton-interactive-inc-announces-pricing-upsized-offering-8750)

## The Play

If that was gibberish, I'll try to spell it out. PTON just sold $1B of convertible notes to wall street.

***What are convertible notes?***

Convertible notes are a type of debt, but instead of just offering to repay the creditor with cash, you give them the option of converting their loan to newly issued shares at a price established before hand. You could also think of it as a call option but, if it's out of the money at expiration, you can get your premium back, and if it's in the money you can ask the company to issue new shares for you.

***What's a call option?***

GTFO

***But wait, isn't creating new shares bad? Wouldn't that dilute the stock?***

Congrats on following along, normally yes. Normally shareholders react negatively to announcements of convertible notes. But PTON is simultaneously buying call options that will accrue value if their common stock gains enough value for the notes to be "in the money".

***What's the "strike price" for PTON's convertible notes?***

This is called the conversion price. The notes are only worth more than their face value if PTON closes above **$240/share**. üöÄ That's 65% upside from today.

***How big is the loan?***

PTON initially offered $600M of notes with the option to purchase an additional $90M. Clearly there was so much interest in that they expanded it to $875M with the option to purchase an additional $125M.

***Is there an expiration date?***

Neither party can do anything before 2024, between 2024 and 2026 investors can convert their notes.

***What's the interest rate?***

Get this, it's **0% interest**.

Let me repeat all that, as it's insane. **The creditors agreed to let PTON owe them $1B for 4-6 years at 0% interest, in exchange for the privilege of converting their investment into PTON shares at $240/share in 4 years.**

Meaning who ever is making this loan not only thinks PTON shares are going to be worth AT LEAST $240 in 4 years, but above $240 enough that this will beat inflation and any other safer investment they could make with that money.

***What's the significance of PTON using call options?***

They state in their 8-K that **they expect the option counterparty (the seller of the call options) to purchase PTON common stock to hedge their position, concurrently or immediately after pricing**. Pricing was finalized this morning. This will happen this week. In order to reach a delta neutral position the option counterparty has to purchase a lot of shares. How many, I don't know, depends on the delta of the spreads, but since they're buying $70M in call spreads that are $116 wide, I assume anywhere between $50M of shares to something like $150M. That's about \~300k-1M shares. That's a big chunk of the average volume however you cut it.

üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

**How to play this?**

üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

Buy call options and shares. I am personally going with 6/18 $160c. I will likely roll these 30 to 60 days to expiration as I see PTON as a long term play. You can choose something closer to expiration.

Caveat, the short term play may not work out. If you buy FDs you might lose your money. The counterparty may do an OTC transaction that gets reported at a later date. I don't really know how any of that works, and you're reading a non-professional's analysis.

If you buy longer expiration options or shares, even if the price doesn't go up this week, it will go up eventually.

## LONG TERM BULLISH STUFF

This is going to be a subjective argument. As a general piece of advice, reading random laypeople's number crunching on the internet is not going to serve you well. I'm being honest with you that I've neither put in the work nor am I qualified to be estimating future earnings or giving you a price target.

That being said, I have some financial advice for you: PTON is going to the moon üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ üåùüåï and you should take a bullish position if you like money.

Yes, I've read all the bearish crap about their financials. The thing is, companies look risky until they don't. I think this one will break out. Clearly lots of wall street institutions think so as well.

## Fundamentals

***Institutional ownership?***

70%. Wall Street is bullish af on this. üöÄüöÄüöÄ

***Why would someone buy a $1500 exercise bike with an ipad?***

I mean this in a non-judgemental and nice way but if you don't understand why someone would purchase a $1500 exercise bike, you are probably poor.

PTON really is the first luxury product in this category. They really succeeded in making the product aspirational. People *want* to own this bike. There is a certain Apple like feel to it. It's a class signifier. It says something about the owner. It looks pretty. You can display it in your living room if you want.

It's cheaper than an Equinox membership. Yes you could go to planet fitness for cheaper but you could also drink ketchup for dinner.

If you have the money, it doesn't make sense to skimp too much on exercise equipment. If you're gonna hate your janky bike from AliExpress, you won't use it.

PTON keeps reporting quarter after quarter that **they are supply limited:** they're selling these bikes as fast as they can be made. This is flying off the shelves like Teslas.

Their subscription plan has the lowest rates of churn in the industry.

***End of the pandemic?***

Your view of the pandemic is short-sighted. The changes in the economy are not temporary, the pandemic really accelerated trends that were already there. I don't expect people to go back to gyms. Lots of people bought exercise equipment during this period, including myself. I hate gyms so much. People stare at you, it's far away, you have to change in public like it's high school.

The experience of hopping on your bike and joining a spin class or doing your own routine is 1000x better. I have become evangelical about how great owning a home spin bike is. Gyms lied to you with their stupid machines, whatever they have at gyms is easily replicated with a yoga mat, a set of  dumbbells and an exercise bike. That's really all your gym needs. Gyms were a flawed concept that relied on making cancellation difficult and making you feel bad about it.

***Positions***

6/19 160c üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

Shares üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

**tl:dr;** Some options writer has to buy a million PTON shares this week, maybe. Also long term PTON is the future of exercise and it's going to the moon.

**Disclaimer**; I am long PTON. I will gain money if this goes to the moon.

**EDIT:** Please don't downvote people who share bearish views in a polite and reasonable way. It doesn't help anyone to suppress opposing view points. Pic for the thumbnail:

Sony's most recent Game Developer acquisition is *insomniac games*  which includes spider man, Ratchet and Clank ‚ù§Ô∏è, Spyro ect ect.

Sony's Aim is to get everyone on their ecosystem, and once that happens they win the game. In a year that price to earnings could decrease due to the increase in their earnings, at which point they will become severely undervalued.

PS5s are being sold at a loss, because the game is in the ecosystem now. Once people are locked in, they start printing cash boys. What am I saying, they are already printing cash.

Here some notes for the real nerds:

Sony's biggest segment (in revenue) - Game and network services. which include PlayStation consoles and Software sales (games). Operating magin around 12%

Next biggest in terms of revenue is their financial services. Operating margin of around 13% and growing steadily for the past 6 years.

Semiconductors - Swings wildy, actually only 11% of total revenue but has done well on the back of the semiconductor shortage.

Music - Sony signs hugely popular artists, operating margin at a solid 17% average.

Pictures - Sony pictures is huge, and owns really popular brands, but only comprises of 8% of the companies operating income. Operating margin a rough 3%.

This is my first DD so let's see how it goes!

Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor and these are my own opinions.

So, where to begin with $BB? We have seen the rise and fall of so-called, "meme stocks" to which $BB was grouped in with. Shortly thereafter, we saw some of them drop off ($BB, $NOK, etc.) while the focus remained on $GME and $AMC.

I am writing this because I, personally, believe in a huge rebound for $BB because they are the forefront of modern technology when it comes to autonomous vehicular design. In the article below we see that $BB's QNX technology is being utilized with Motional's autonomous vehicle design. This is as of Feb 9, 2021 (TODAY!)

[https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2021/blackberrys-qnx-black-channel-communications-to-be-used-in-motionals-driverless-platform](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2021/blackberrys-qnx-black-channel-communications-to-be-used-in-motionals-driverless-platform)

Here we see, "[BlackBerry Limited](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en) (NYSE: BB; TSX: BB) today announced an expansion of its strategic partnership with [Baidu](http://iv.baidu.com/), whose high-definition maps will run on the [QNX¬Æ Neutrino¬Æ Real-time](https://blackberry.qnx.com/en/software-solutions/embedded-software/qnx-neutrino-rtos) Operating System (RTOS) and will be mass-produced in the forthcoming GAC New Energy Aion models from the EV arm of [GAC Group](https://www.gac-motor.com/) (Guangzhou Automobile Group Co., Ltd.)."

For those of you who don't know, BAIDU is a Chinese multi-national corporation valued at over 573 Billion dollars. This is HUGE news.

As if that wasn't enough, they also mentioned in Dec of 2020 a partnership with AWS to utilize their software to accelerate their innovation with new intelligent vehicle data platform.

[https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2020/aws-blackberry-join-forces-to-accelerate-innovation-with-new-intelligent-vehicle-data-platform](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2020/aws-blackberry-join-forces-to-accelerate-innovation-with-new-intelligent-vehicle-data-platform)

I find this all super promising as it appears that $BB has drawn away from the idea of phones and has started investing time and resources in their software for the future of society which in my opinion is autonomous vehicles.
