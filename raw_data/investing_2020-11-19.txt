 Commerce Resources Corp. (TSX V - CCE, Frankfurt - D7HO) Ashram REE/ Fluorspar Deposit The world is transitioning away from dependency on fossil fuels and the REE’s are essential to this vision for the future with green technologies.  

AND

The world’s largest exporter(China) of both the REE’s and fluorspar has become a net importer of both commodities.

It can be stated that everyone who is looking to reduce or eliminate their current dependency on China, and looking to find a new source of either the REE’s or fluorspar, are actually in competition with China on this goal.  

In this case, what are you thoughts that how investing in CCE can generate positive results for you?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Mnuchin Declines to Extend Several Fed Emergency Lending Programs “The Federal Reserve would prefer that the full suite of emergency facilities established during the coronavirus pandemic continue to serve their important role as a backstop for our still-strained and vulnerable economy,” the Fed said in a statement.

If an omniscient all-knowing investor could precisely predict all future cashflows paid from the company to the investor, what would be the correct discount rate used to calculate the intrinsic value of that stock? As long as you assign an arbitrary discount rate greater than zero, buying the stock at that price and reinvesting the dividends at the same rate of return will yield the same annualized return as the discount rate. So what is the "correct" rate of return an investor should have? If we base that on govt bonds then what is the holding period to find the "correct" yield on the yield curve?

In practice, it doesn't matter because we compare the intrinsic value of the company to the market price to figure out which stock is cheapest.

Also, if the intrinsic value of a company is calculated by discounting all future cash flows to the investor then you can precisely calculate the past intrinsic value of a bankrupt company since all the cash flows are known.

ARK Investment Management-a privately-held asset manager founded just six years ago-has been in the spotlight a lot this year thanks to its vocal founder and stellar investment record.

A recent regulatory filing suggests that Resolute Investment Managers—ARK funds’ U.S. distributor—plans to take control of the company early next year.

**It turns out that when Resolute acquired a minority stake in ARK in 2016, the deal also included an option that allows Resolute to purchase a controlling stake—if it wants—before the option expires in early 2021.** ARK, which manages $30 billion in assets, including $15 billion across seven exchange-traded funds, has more than tripled its assets in the past year alone. Now, Resolute is exercising its option to own a bigger piece of the cake.

Cathie Wood, ARK’s founder and CEO who owns 50% to 75% of the firm, is fighting the takeover. In a statement, Wood said she is “disappointed” about Resolute’s “unwelcome notice” of its intention to seize control of the business. “The remarkable success of our team is rooted firmly in a culture of transparency, collaboration, and employee ownership,” she wrote. “We do not believe that equity ownership by a party tangential to our business is in the best interest of ARK’s stakeholders.” Wood didn’t comment beyond the statement.

Ben Johnson, director of global exchange-traded fund research for Morningstar, highly doubts there will be a management change at ARK. "Resolute has been operating largely at arm's length, distributing products and opening doors for the ARK team and not necessarily meddling in their day-to-day affairs and telling them how to manage money," says Johnson, "What they want to do is to exercise the call option that is very much in the money right now, that's what they signed up on."_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Why do people invest in international ETFs?

So I recently thought it would be fun to try and build a portfolio with a low drawdown, and the highest possible yield. I went into it with the goal of a drawdown under 2% with a cagr of at least 3%. The idea is to make a portfolio that you'd feel safe using as a savings account of source, **something liquid that you don't mind selling even at the bottom of a drawdown.**

So, my challenge to everyone is, to [try and beat this portfolio](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&timePeriod=4&startYear=1985&firstMonth=1&endYear=2020&lastMonth=12&calendarAligned=true&includeYTD=false&initialAmount=10000&annualOperation=0&annualAdjustment=0&inflationAdjusted=true&annualPercentage=0.0&frequency=4&rebalanceType=4&absoluteDeviation=5.0&relativeDeviation=25.0&showYield=false&reinvestDividends=true&portfolioNames=false&portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&symbol1=ISTB&allocation1_1=30&symbol2=VMBS&allocation2_1=24&symbol3=BNDX&allocation3_1=35&symbol4=VTI&allocation4_1=8&symbol5=VGLT&allocation5_1=3). This is entirely cheating BTW because it misses both the dotcom and subprime crisis. Unfortunately, I didn't save the funds, but it would have had a drawdown of about 2.5% during the dotcom crisis, and 5% during the subprime crisis.

You don't have to have a drawdown under 2%, as long as it would be something you'd feel safe selling for emergency car repairs at any point in time, I'm interested to see people's individual risk tolerances on this as well, or if someone can outright beat me in every respect(please do!).

The ARM architecture has hitherto been largely restricted to low power consumption devices (phones, tablets), but the M1 chip may popularize larger, higher performance form factors, providing direct competition to Intel and AMD, who design chips with the x86 and x86-64 architecture, the typical architecture in most PCs and Macs.

I’ve more recently started getting interested in the oil and gas industry, specifically Canadian and US companies. With covid, obviously stocks have taken a massive hit, but I don’t see them going much lower. Due to the cyclical nature of the industry, I believe we might be near the bottom and within 6-12 months as oil demand increases these stocks may rebound. My belief is that investing now might be a good opportunity to gain off the rebound of the industry since many stocks are basically as low now as ever in the last 10 years. My opinion is that I wouldn’t invest in the industry for a long time and hold, but as a 2-4 year play this might be good.

Bitcoin has one of its wealthiest backers yet.

[Ricardo Salinas Pliego](https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/id/14012146), Mexico’s third-richest person, said in a Twitter post Tuesday he’s invested a chunk of his liquid assets in the world’s biggest cryptocurrency.

“Many people ask me if I have bitcoins,” said Salinas, who has a $11.8 billion fortune through his stakes in retail, banking and broadcast businesses, according to the [Bloomberg Billionaires Index](https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/). “YES. I have 10% of my liquid portfolio invested it.”

Bitcoin is nearing record highs after more than doubling this year, partly driven by fears that major central bank easing and fiscal stimulus will debase currencies. The digital asset [advanced](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-17/bitcoin-tops-17-000-for-first-time-since-december-2017) for a third session Wednesday, outperforming most of its rivals to break above $18,000. Its performance has attracted some big Wall Street money managers including Fidelity Investments, which launched a Bitcoin fund over the summer, and macro investor [Paul Tudor Jones](https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/id/1704916).

In a series of tweets Tuesday, hedge fund founder [Ray Dalio](https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/id/1801626) questioned the cryptocurrency’s utility as a storehold of wealth, but [added](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-17/ray-dalio-says-he-might-be-missing-something-about-bitcoin): “I might be missing something about Bitcoin, so I’d love to be corrected.”

Other wealthy Bitcoin backers include Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, the twins who are [now](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-06/winklevoss-twins-ride-bitcoin-surge-to-become-billionaires-again) worth about $1 billion each from the cryptocurrency’s surge, according to Bloomberg’s wealth index.

Bitcoin’s gains have helped make up for Salinas’s business interests. Shares in his biggest listed asset -- conglomerate [Grupo Elektra SAB](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/ELEKTRA%2A:MM) \-- have slumped more than 10% this year, while those in the local [television network](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/AZTECACP:MM) he and his family control have dropped almost 60%.

A spokesman for Salinas didn’t immediately reply to an email and phone call seeking comment.

Salinas, 65, who contracted Covid-19 last month, [said](https://twitter.com/RicardoBSalinas/status/1328895703486255104) in a later tweet he first invested in Bitcoin four years ago, adding he holds the balance of his liquid portfolio in precious metals miners. Salinas and his family have earned more than $500 million through dividends from their listed holdings in the past two decades, according to the Bloomberg’s wealth index.

Salinas has also used Twitter to comment on the pandemic. He previously called for Mexico’s health officials to stop imposing “[authoritarian](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-15/mexican-billionaire-says-health-officials-are-wrecking-economy)” policies to contain the spread of virus and took to the site again to reveal his own diagnosis.

Thought this was a great video to share to calibrate expectations for the upcoming 6 months to 1 year. It goes through what an economic recovery looks like for markets (the "reflation" trade) and which asset classes you would expect to outperform in the scenario. It also goes through the real risk of inflation and deflationary scenarios based on past data and trends. 

Highlights: 

\- The reflation trade is an expectation that a global economic recovery will take place that takes equities (especially global and emerging market equities) and commodity prices higher due to increased demand. Value and beat up sectors will outperform growth due to a recovery in demand and the relative lag. 

\- Reflation and inflation are not the same. Inflation can happen with or without economic growth, which leads to stagflation and likely a stall in asset price appreciation. 

\-  Reasons for possible inflation: Money supply has exploded higher along with savings rates. While it has not made its way into the economy yet, the impetus of economic growth could make banks more open to lending and people spending their savings; leading to higher money velocity and higher inflation. Fiscal stimulus to combat the slowdown could over reach and cause a spending spree by putting the money directly into the hands of individual who will spend it rather than banks who have been reluctant to lend. 

\- Reasons against inflation: Usually there is deflation historically after recessions due to lack of demand. We are likely entering into a double dip recession with increased lockdowns. 

\- Inflation could be destabilizing : Inflation will lead to higher yields for all debt. At record US debt levels and without higher growth, this could make it difficult for overextended companies to roll over debt increasing default risk. It will also lead to a depreciation in fixed income instruments, causing a domino effect of deleveraging due to asset prices falling. This was seen in taper tantrum of 2018. 

\- Yield curve control will attempt to backstop this possibility if it happens. 

\- Good to own bonds at the long end of the curve (ex. TLT) if you are long equities right now and want to protect against a deflationary response._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Daily Advice Thread - All basic help or advice questions must be posted here.

Key points:

-  The University of Oxford confirmed that the Covid-19 vaccine it’s developing with AstraZeneca Plc produced strong immune responses in older adults in an early study, with pivotal findings from the final phase of trials expected in the coming weeks.

- The results of Oxford’s phase 2 study show that the vaccine is better tolerated in older people and produces a similar immune response in old and young adults. The study involved 560 adults, including 240 over the age of 70. That follows findings in older participants unveiled last month and data in July that showed the vaccine generated robust immune responses in adults ages 18 to 55.

- Since the start of the pandemic, however, people have been opting for more solitary options such as cars and bicycles. But street space is in short supply in dense cities such as New York and Paris. As a result, big cities should expect big changes in how people get around in 2021.

- The latest contender for street supremacy is the e-scooter, which can be rented by the minute using a smartphone app. Startups have launched scooter services in cities around the world, and the pandemic has strengthened the case for their adoption. In Berlin, which has thousands of e-scooters, usage rose when lockdown eased in May 2020.

If I buy PSTH now, do I still get 1 warrant for every 9 shares I own? It seems like I missed the stock split train, so no? But wanted to confirm.

I was reading this article and it seems not: https://www.barrons.com/articles/pershing-square-tontine-holdings-units-split-on-friday-heres-what-that-means-51599756914

But I’m not sure why people are still buying it. There are people heavily invested after the split, so does that mean they don’t care about the warrants? Is warrants how to hit the big bux? Also some people say it comes with options, is that what a warrant is?

I’m a little confused and would love help here._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Does it make sense to leverage your portfolio with rates so low? With interest rates so low, am I a sucker for not leveraging my portfolio?

#The math:

(Using Canadian values)

Cost of borrowing = 1.5% + benchmark -- gets lower over $100K

CAD benchmark rate = -0.0037% [0] -- fluctuates daily

Margin requirement = 30% to 50% [1]

Max S&P drawdown in a given recession: 56% (2007) [2]

**So, with expected gains at 7%, and borrowing costs at ~1.5%, isn't this a no brainer?**

Leverage your portfolio to 1.5-2x, and enjoy 78% (7%/(7%-1.5%)) higher returns as long as you can hold onto the position.

#Risk:

Having margin requirement raised. Happened during the recent US election. Could push you into a margin call. Only about 1 week notice.

IB will just liquidate you without warning.

A recession could wipe you out if your leverage is at or over 2x if it's as bad as 2008.

---

#Other things:

Potential to earn income for lending out hard to borrow shares (not much)

Monthly fee of $10 and transaction fees

Will be earning money through work to reduce leverage, even in the event of recession (assuming no job loss) so may be able to hold onto position for longer.

Note, I'm not affiliated in any way with IB, but they seem to have the best rates and the numbers don't work with any other lender unless you have millions. 

QuestTrade is also interesting because it allows you to use your TFSA as buying power for margin requirements, but it's SO expensive.

I'm asking here because I was searching everywhere for people who were doing this and I couldn't find *anything*. Maybe I wasn't using the right words? Idk.

TL;DR: Borrow cheap money to buy S&P?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Best way to buy puts on the bond market My brokerage doesn't offer many avenues. The best way on there seems to be through buying puts on treasuries (this whole creation-unit problem with high yield and municipal bond ETFs, while over my head, also just make the whole thing less appealing). The spreads are quite interesting. Through January 2022, ATM bid-ask is relatively tight in the low/mid $200s. But once you're out to Jan 2023, it's blown wide open. Bids are practically zero, while asks are at $500.

I guess everyone's thinking the same thing here, even if they don't agree with it. Is anyone else here looking into how you'll be shorting the bond market? I'd like a way to buy puts, as it rings most familiar to me, but any strategy is welcome. I've just started and, like most people, am fairly clueless when it comes to bonds, and therefore the best way to short them. I've never even bought a bond in my life._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ The Internet Bond Interested to hear the thoughts of the community regarding what some folks are calling The Internet Bond.

*Epistemic Status: I will be staking Eth in the beacon chain*

It certainly has similarities to perpetual bonds. The main two differences are that your rewards fall as more people stake to validate and the lack of liquidity in Phase 0. I will be curious to see how it will work once phase 1.5 is reached.

>In the world of crypto and Proof of Stake, staking bonds can be viewed as a type of contractor license bond. Ethereum Validators, for example, are required to stake 32 ETH as collateral to register their node on the network and in return obtain the ‘license’ to support consensus operations on-chain.

>By obtaining this license, the validator agrees to adhere to the network’s rules, which is to behave honestly and guarantee continued operations. In return, they receive periodic rewards.

>The bond in this case is an agreement structured between:

>The Principal i.e. the Validator

>The Obligee and Issuer i.e. the Ethereum Blockchain

>In this example, Ethereum acts as both the obligee and the issuer. That is, it programmatically defines and enforces the rules defined to maintain the network’s integrity. Validators that fulfill their obligations earn rewards as an incentive for doing so, while those who do not meet their operative requirements or behave maliciously run the risk of incurring penalties, forfeitures and/or lose the right to participate (‘slashing’)._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Is anyone else eyeing Sumo Logic (SUMO)? Cloud companies have gotten a lot of hype this year but this one seems to have fallen off everyone's radar. From what I can see, SUMO extremely well positioned to be a strong player in an accelerating industry and their client books is already impressive. It's currently trading below IPO price and I am definitely thinking of taking a stake, especially with earnings coming early next month.

Thank you for taking the time to read this!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Long term Dispersed ETF investment tactic 
I am new to investing and had an idea which i am not sure is good or silly.

As I am new to this game and am not confident in betting big on any one company yet I am leaning towards ETF’s. 

My idea on this is as follows:
What if I were to spread my savings money (which is a relatively large sum to me) among a number of ETF’s I think would be good in the long term, e.g:
Spread across S&P 500, World Market ETF, Chinese Market ETF, Clean Energy ETF, HealthCare ETF 

Now as most ETF tend to boat steady rise over long periods would it not be good to make movements of funds between an ETF that is on a spike to one that is in a dip for E.g (hypothetical):
Moving a large portion of the money in the World Market ETF (which is on a big spike) to the Clean Energy ETF (which is in a big dip).

As ETF tends to boast gains over time would this tactic mean I might miss less drops in value and experience more rises as time goes by? 

I am conscious I am very green to all of this so could easily be missing something that makes this a terrible idea. Any advice would be really appreciated!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_
