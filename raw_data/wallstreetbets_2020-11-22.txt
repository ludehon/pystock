It has been on a tear and will continue to be so. 

Robinhood raised money in August 2020 at a $11.2 billion valuation.

In the most recent quarter, Robinhood generated $180 million in revenue from its 13 million users. That's about $14 per user. And it's not clear if the company made any profit at all.

Apart from being very profitable, Futu Holdings generated $88.7 million in revenue from its 303,102 paying users. That's about $292 per user ‚Äì over 20 times higher than Robinhood, which operates under a free-to-trade platform.

Futu also operates in China, a country with around four times the population of the U.S. So its potential market is dramatically larger than Robinhood's. And China is a country much less resistant to technological changes than the U.S.

Simply put, it's hard to imagine Futu not dwarfing Robinhood in size ‚Äì both in revenue and profits ‚Äì over the next few years. Yet Futu's total market capitalization today is just around $4 billion.

The share price would need to more than double in value in order for Futu to reach the same valuation as Robinhood today.

I don't know about you, but I'd rather own the fast-growing business that's already proven to be profitable. Outside of name recognition, no reasonable investors would prefer Robinhood given that choice.

One of his backed companies and number 32 on the[ 2020 CNBC Disruptor](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/16/meet-the-2020-cnbc-disruptor-50-companies.html)  list alongside other giants such as Snowflake, Airbnb, Stripe and  Robinhood is going public via Longview Acquisition ($LGVW).

The deal is planned to close by the end of Q1 and will be listed on the  NYSE with the ticker BFLY. Don't want to wait til Q1? Don't worry, you can cash in the pre merger announcement boom.

So what do they do? Well in short they make handheld digital ultrasound devices which[ doctors can triage and monitor patients faster‚Äîand sometimes more accurately](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/handheld-ultrasound-devices-are-speeding-diagnosis-of-covid-19/)   with. It retails at $3k which is cheaper than traditional ultrasound  machines that range between $9k to $20k. It's basically a market which  barely existed before COVID and is now exploding in demand with a few  players such as Phillips and GE.

So why Butterfly over Phillips, GE and the others? Well not many other  competitors can produce at the cost/quality level that Butterfly network  can offer, so they‚Äôre getting a huge first mover advantage.

Plus extra cash and investor hype will be great, GE/Phillips can‚Äôt fully  dedicate 500 FTEs and $500M in cash the way Butterfly can. ***Once doctors choose a device, they‚Äôll almost never change***. So it‚Äôs a truly winner-take-most market, for which Butterfly has a headstart in.

In fact, Butterfly has already sold to or has agreements in place with a majority of the largest 100 hospitals in the United States and is commercially available in over 20 countries . To add as well, they're already pretty known with healthcare professionals achieving an  exceptional Net Promoter Score of 71 (USA).

## Palantir Direct Listing

Contrary to what many investors think, Palantir did not do an Initial Public Offering, "IPO," when it started trading on the New York Stock Exchange on September 30th, 2020. Instead, it did a Direct Listing.

First, here's how an IPO generally works:

>In an IPO, new shares of the company are created, and are underwritten by an intermediary. The underwriter works closely with the company throughout the IPO process, including deciding the initial offer price of the shares, helping with regulatory requirements, buying the available shares from the company and then selling them to investors via their distribution networks.  
Source: [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/investing/difference-between-ipo-and-direct-listing/)

In short, Wall Street gets involved. It's very lucrative for it, and it makes most of its money when the stock hits the exchange. It "buys" a pile of low-price shares - or gets an allocation - and then profits handsomely when shares are offered to the public.

In contrast, here's how a Direct Listing works:

>"...the business sells shares directly to the public without the help of any intermediaries. It does not involve any underwriters or other intermediaries, there are no new shares issued..."  
Source: [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/investing/difference-between-ipo-and-direct-listing/)

In other words, owners sell directly without much Wall Street involvement. Typically, with direct listings, there is no lock-up period. This is important and I promise I'll come back to this since it's a critical point.

I won't get too far into the weeds about how direct listings work because it's distracting and not needed here. Instead, if you're overly interested in why a company might want to do a Direct Listing versus an IPO, then you can spend time reviewing this [Pros and Cons](https://assets.fenwick.com/legacy/FenwickDocuments/The-Pros-and-Cons-of-a-Direct-Listing.pdf) material:

üì∑

At this point, we can almost dive into the key question about the PLTR lock-up. However, I want to emphasize that IPOs generally have lock-up periods. Here's how [Andreessen Horowitz explains it](https://a16z.com/2019/07/02/direct-listings/) (skip down to my summary if you wish):

>In a traditional IPO, existing company shareholders agree to a period, typically 180 days from the date of the IPO pricing, where they are restricted from selling, hedging, or distributing shares. While they are not mandated to do so by the SEC, investment banks usually ask for this because it allows for a set period of time for the company's shares to trade and establish a track record. Having a set amount of stock (the float) available for trading theoretically provides more predictability, allowing the stock to stabilize a bit before more share volume comes onto the market. On the other hand, the float in a typical IPO is such a small amount - usually \~10% of the company's total stock - that this artificial restriction also forces distortions for both investors buying large amounts (who have to build up their position gradually and typically have to wait until after the lock-up expires) as well as for others seeking the stock's true price (not enough volume in the true market of sellers and buyers to determine it).

My apologies for the wall of text, but there are several important points if you care about PLTR's lock-up, and what it could mean for PLTR's stock price.

Here's a quick summary.

1. There's typically a 180-day lock-up period with IPOs but not direct listings.
2. This is done to help the market establish a price track record.
3. Typically about 10% of the entire float is available.

If you read between the lines, this causes a certain level of scarcity or "pop!" when the stock starts trading, which insiders love. Furthermore, this creates a cliff because - in theory - when the lock-up period expires, shares flood the market and prices die off.

We will come back to IPO lock-up expiration price adjustments in a short while. Before that, please allow me to explain more about how PLTR is not like other direct listings, but instead, it's far more like an IPO for our purposes here.

## Do Not Compare SPOT and WORK to PLTR

Both Spotify (NYSE:SPOT) and Slack (NYSE:WORK) went public through direct listings. However, to be perfectly clear, SPOT had no lock-up period for employees. Similarly, WORK had no lock-up period.

Therefore, we cannot compare the price action of SPOT or WORK to PLTR in relation to any kind of lock-up period. It's literally impossible as far as I know. Perhaps there is some model we could use, but it would be oddly lubricated by theory, not practice or real-world data.

I'm going to circle back to an earlier point about IPOs, namely that lock-ups are all about liquidity.

>Since the actual float in a typical IPO is too small of an allocation to be a "full position" for very large mutual funds with multibillion dollar holdings, it's only when more shares come on the market through releasing the lock-up (the overhang) that these investors can build a larger and more substantial position with more liquidity.  
Source: Andreessen Horowitz

In other words, since the float is low, it's hard for whales, elephants and institutional investors to gobble up shares without driving prices up. Therefore, they often wait until the lock-up period is over. They are constrained, but this is also a source of buying power at a later time - a fact that most investors gloss over, but which helps to create a balance in the force after a lock-up.

## Back Door Pressure Release Valve

PLTR really is a different animal. Here's a curveball because it's something most retail investors simply don't know.

>The company is 17 years old, so there may be pent-up demand to sell, although as the company had an active secondary market, anyone desperate to sell could have already unloaded.  
Source: [The Information](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/palantirs-direct-listing-lockup-the-informations-tech-briefing)

That's right. Although the company is "17 years old," its employees have had a financial safety valve of sorts through back channels.

For example, I know from personal and direct experience that EquityZen offered deals to prospective PLTR investors. In fact, I almost took a bite.

In other words, if you were a PLTR employee, and you wanted cash instead of your PLTR shares, you could have sold out before the direct listing.

Therefore, that's a liquidation opportunity for cash poor employees. More importantly, PLTR had back doors open. Even if only marginal, I feel that helped shake loose the weak hands; price volatility stabilizer.

Now we can shift over into exploring the real skin in the game. Here's where exposure and opportunity get most interesting.

## Typical IPO Lock-Up Expiration Behavior

How many shares of PLTR are available to trade? [Per MarketWatch](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-palantir-non-ipo-5-things-to-know-about-the-formerly-secretive-software-companys-direct-listing-11601351442):

>For Palantir, though, years of venture-capital investments have created more than enough shares to launch public trading: roughly 1.64 billion, though that grows to 2.17 billion in a fully diluted formula that includes vesting options.

As I write this, about 497 million shares are outstanding. So, my quick math tells me that about 23% of all shares fully diluted are currently outstanding. About 1.7 billion shares could potentially hit the market after the lock-up.

I indicated above that with an IPO, you'll see 10% of the shares released. Here, with PLTR, we're already seeing over 20% of shares trading. It's over double the typical number of a newly listed company, so keep that in mind as well. Once again, there's less pressure on prices after lock-up.

With all this as background, [here's how to put this in perspective](https://www.ig.com/en/trading-strategies/what-is-an-ipo-lockup-period-and-how-do-you-trade-it--191018):

>A flood of new shares can come onto the market if the owners of those shares decide to sell. If the share price has soared since the IPO, then early investors may want to reap the rewards by selling some of their investments, or if the price has tanked, then they may look to reduce their exposure. However, it does not mean they will sell either way as they could look to retain shares in the hope of prices heading even higher, or because they believe shares could recover any value lost in the early days as a public company.

Furthermore...

>...if there is a sharp increase in the number of available shares available in a company then this pushes the price of a stock down. It is not unusual to see a stock's share price fall on the first day that the lock-up shares can be traded. In fact, if other investors (not subject to the lock-up period) begin to sell in the days before the lock-up expires, then this is a sign that they expect the share price to fall.

So, price action alone won't exactly tell us what's going on. Current buyers might sell out of fear, or greed. And insiders might do exactly the same. It comes down to expectations about future prospects for the company since we don't know if selling is profit taking or hedging against the fear of a big loss.

## Insights From Real World Data

IG recently looked at [15 stocks with lock-up periods expiring in October](https://www.ig.com/en/trading-strategies/what-is-an-ipo-lockup-period-and-how-do-you-trade-it--191018). The majority of these stocks saw their prices fall before the lock-up expiration. This is quite logical. Yet, the good news is many stocks saw their prices bounce back three to five days later. A few of them saw no selling pressure at all. In fact, share price immediately went higher once the lock-up expired.

I'll point out that you can expect volatility from traders who are cashing out or just making guesses ahead of time. But, if the company is strong and growing, the price will come back quickly with support. I'm speculating this would be from all those non-insider institutional investors who are finally able to take a bite of the apple.

Here's how to put this together:

* If share prices have skyrocketed since the IPO, some percentage of insiders will want to cash out, or sell some portion of their shares.
* If share prices have fallen since the IPO, some insiders might want to wait for sunshine so they'll hold.
* If share prices have fallen since the IPO, some insiders might want to sell to cut their loss.

Also keep in mind that many insiders have free or very low-cost shares they've been holding for years. That could mean they don't need to sell as much to profit in a big way. Or they might wish to finally sell and move onward.

## What To Do With PLTR

According to BusinessWire, [the lock-up period](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200929006146/en/Palantir-Announces-Additional-Update-Regarding-Outstanding-Shares-of-Common-Stock-and-Shares-Permitted-to-Be-Sold-Under-Lock-Up-Agreements):

>"...is expected to continue until the start of the third trading day following the date of public disclosure of Palantir's financial results for the year ending December 31, 2020 (the 'lock-up period')."

So, depending on the exact timing of the reporting of results, traders can start to play with the potential dips and the price stabilization shortly after.

In theory, investors could short PLTR perhaps 7-10 days before the lock-up expiration. Or, traders could use short-term options - especially puts - to play the downside opportunity. It's unclear if there's enough downside potential to make this work. Then again, even a small dip could magnify profits because of option leverage. Please note that I'm talking here about short-term trades.

Long-term investors who are bullish are probably going to see some kind of dip, but then reasonable price discovery and a lift back into a similar price range.

In the grand scheme, there's probably not much to worry about as long as PLTR continues to grow like a weed. Small dips could actually be an opportunity to nibble, or back up the truck. Also consider the forces at play. Namely, insiders might be selling thereby increasing downside pressure. But outsiders - such as hedge funds, institutions, and even banks - might be inclined to load up on shares thereby increasing upside pressure. It can go both ways in a tug of war.

Here's yet another thing to consider. If an investor is worried about PLTR's price right now, which is below $20, but waits to invest, there is the potential of a price run to $25 or even $30, or higher. If the price hits $30, but the lock-up expiration drives the price down, will it drop to $28, $25, $22, $20, $18, or much lower? In other words, the future "lock-up expiration dip" might still be well above the current price of about $18. In effect, a long investor might be forced to pay way more in an effort to hedge a drop in price caused by the lock-up expiration. Fear and uncertainty *appear* to keep investors safe whereas what could really happen is the opposite. Indeed, the price could run up so high that no dip big enough will ever manifest. It'll be the one that got away.

I'll wrap up by saying that my research currently indicates that PLTR will likely see some downward price pressure from the lock-up expiration. However, I am not convinced the drop in price will be significant enough to warrant a delay in investing for the long term. At the same time, there will almost certainly be an opportunity for traders and speculators to use options to play in short time periods as we get closer to PLTR's lock-up expiration. Therefore, like so many things in life, it ultimately depends on the wants, needs and goals of individual investors to weigh the risks and rewards.

I'm a long-term investor and I'm not worried. In fact, even if there is a rather large dip, it could encourage me to invest more. I'll determine my best path forward based on the growth of PLTR with respect to the value I see. In other words, as a net buyer and PLTR long, the ideal situation would be a huge price drop with a radical increase in growth and profits. I love discounts. But again, to be crystal clear, I don't expect a huge gap like this to appear. That's why I've gone long and continue to use LEAPS to play a long-term, forward game.

‚ÄúThe FDA on Saturday issued emergency use authorization for Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc's COVID-19 antibody therapy, an experimental treatment given to President Donald Trump that he said helped cure him of the disease.

The FDA said the monoclonal antibodies, casirivimab and imdevimab, should be administered together for the treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19 in adults and pediatric patients with positive results of direct SARS-CoV-2 viral testing and who are at high risk for progressing to severe COVID-19.

This includes those who are 65 years of age or older or who have certain chronic medical conditions.

The FDA on Saturday issued emergency use authorization for Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc's COVID-19 antibody therapy, an experimental treatment given to President Donald Trump that he said helped cure him of the disease
The treatment is part of a class of drugs known as monoclonal antibodies, which are manufactured copies of antibodies created by the human body to fight infections.

Regeneron's REGEN-COV2 'antibody cocktail' - containing an antibody made by the company and a second isolated from humans who recovered from COVID-19 - is designed so that the two antibodies seek out and bind to the coronavirus' spike protein to prevent it from entering healthy human cells.

Regeneron said on Saturday the clinical evidence from outpatient trial suggests that monoclonal antibodies such as REGEN-COV2 have the greatest benefit when given early after diagnosis and in patients who have not yet mounted their own immune response or who have high viral load.

WHAT IS REGENERON'S ANTIBODY COCKTAIL?

Regeneron's drug 'cocktail,' REGN-COV2, contains an antibody made by the company from mice and another isolated from a recovered COVID-19 patient, each of which may help to neutralize coronavirus. 

The firm's latest data from the ongoing trials, show the drug drove down the viral loads of patients who were not hospitalized and cut their recovery times by nearly half. 

But it's very much an experimental treatment, and the data announced earlier this week are the first published from the trial. 

Two patients treated with the antibody cocktail had 'adverse events' - undesirable side effects. One of those was a 'serious' adverse event, but Regeneron did not reveal details of what happened to the patient, who received a low dose of the drug. 

REGN-COV2 is comprised of a duo of therapeutics in a class of drugs known as monoclonal antibodies (hence REGN-COV2's distinction as a 'polyclonal antibody'), which are clones of antibody that attacks a specific antigen.

The company said it expects to have does of REGEN-COV2 treatment ready for about 80,000 patients by the end of this month, about 200,000 patients by the first week of January and approximately 300,000 patients in total by the end of January.

The FDA said the antibodies are not authorized for patients who are hospitalized due to COVID-19 or require oxygen therapy due to COVID-19.

Trump spent three days at Walter Reed after his infection in early October, where he received a variety of experimental treatments, including an antibody therapy from Regeneron.

Monoclonal antibodies treatments are also being developed by Eli Lilly and other companies.

The drugs mimic antibodies that the immune system naturally produces to fight off viruses and other pathogens.

Trump later credited the experimental drug therapy with aiding his recovery.

Trump returned to the White House on Monday October 5 after spending three days hospitalized at Walter Reed Military Medical Center in Maryland for coronavirus.

The monoclonal antibody cocktail is considered experimental because clinical trials are ongoing and it hasn‚Äôt been approved for the market by the FDA.

Trump was able to receive it through the FDA‚Äôs 'compassionate use' provision, where unapproved drugs are administered to seriously ill patients who have no other treatment options.

While Regeneron has shared promising results of the treatment, which cut the viral load of COVID-19 patients who were not hospitalized, there is no evidence the drug cut the risk of death or 'cured' patients.

There also is no way for the president or his doctors to know that the drug had any effect.

Last month, Bill Gates said Trump was wrong to call monoclonal antibodies treatment a 'cure' for COVID-19, but says it‚Äôs the most promising therapeutic in research for now.

'The word "cure" is inappropriate because it won't work for everyone. But of all the therapeutics, this is the most promising,' the Microsoft founder said on the October 11 broadcast of NBC‚Äôs Meet The Press.‚Äù_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ MRVL next great chip play Ok so my first official DD but I‚Äôve got some conviction around it so I thought I‚Äôd get the beautiful masses to opine

My thesis is MRVL is undervalued and primed for a earnings, EOY and 2021 run. Four main points:

1. The whole chip sector is exploding between the tech wave, 5g, cloud, etc (and even the beloved palantir needing chips as they grow like crazy). And MRVL is focused on 5g and cloud infrastructure specifically and kickin ass in these markets

2. Within this sector, MRVL is a value play at 20x PE. That‚Äôs compared to a company like Nvidia at 85 and AMD at 120! But they all 3 have comparable gross profit margins. This means that as things keep looking up this offers bigger growth potential than the big players

3. MRVL price has been depressed because they made a huge acquisition in October of INPHI. This gives them huge further growth potential into their strengths of 5g and cloud.  And this merger is virtually guaranteed not at some level questionable like the ARM-NVDA deal. 

AND this makes them a great acquisition target for a big player cuz they have a ton of assets at a lowish price. 

Here‚Äôs the MRVL CEO talking about the acquisition:
Marvell Tech CEO on acquiring data center company Inphi, 5G growth
https://www.cnbc.com/video/2020/10/29/marvell-tech-ceo-on-acquiring-data-center-company-inphi-5g-growth.html?__source=iosappshare%7Ccom.apple.UIKit.activity.Message

4. MRVL has huge institutional ownership (at 89%!) so if we do start to get some price movement the float is small enough that we could see a 10-20% move in share price fast as retail fomos in. Especially in the event of an acquisition.  Also this should reinforce that smart money sees this as a great play. 


With earnings coming up on 12/3 I think we see a modest run into it and then a pop on earnings. Yes I said it a pop! Not a pull back like most other tech because this is the first time we hear all the details of this acquisition and it‚Äôs potential huge value that MRVL hasn‚Äôt run on. 

I‚Äôm taking a short and long term position for lower risk. If we do get a good earnings run up I‚Äôll flip my short term calls into shares for the long term. 

100 12/11 46c
50 1/21/22 50c 

TLDR: buy MRVL. You‚Äôll thank me later


Side note: I‚Äôm a big fan of the strategy of buying leaps then selling super otm weeklies against them and buying shares with that money to build a position for free essentially with the leaps as long term leverage. This is my plan for my MRVL leaps once earnings passes. This strategy has been working out for me on SPY but I‚Äôd love to hear peoples thoughts on any pitfalls they see._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ IQIY is your ticket to Valhalla and I‚Äôm handing it to you on a silver platter Alright retards, grab your helmets and your favorite cum sock cause this one will make your pps rock solid, IQ.

IQIYi is some Chinese-anime-fugazi-ass cross-hybrid of Netflix, YouTube, and also games. They‚Äôve been around since 2010 and have somehow slipped under the radar of american retail traders such as your retarded selves until now. Basically their business model consists of a subscriber based platform which costs approximately $3 per month and normally you‚Äôd think ‚Äúoh wow, a measly $3 per month‚Äù, but they also generate ad revenue and have a user base of a 100 fucking million subscribers. Yes, 100 Milly paying subscribers. A month.

To put 100 million subscribers in perspective to some other streaming platforms:

* Netflix: 200 million subscribers
* Disney+: 73 million subscribers
* Hulu: 35 million subscribers

And I know compared to these streaming services their monthly subscription cost is not particularly in line, but again they also generate ad revenue and just having that large of a consumer base in reason in itself

The best part is, currently, IQ is sitting at around $22.60 a share down from $28 after missing earnings and stagnated growth in expanding their subscriber base. They are sitting almost exactly where they were 20 days prior to an earnings run up and ultimate fall. HOWEVER, these crafty bastards are just getting started.

I was thinking about listing out all the financials but I am lazy so if you care enough here is their last quarterly results.

[https://iqiyiinc.gcs-web.com/static-files/dd084613-3629-47b7-bf0e-258aa84fbf59](https://iqiyiinc.gcs-web.com/static-files/dd084613-3629-47b7-bf0e-258aa84fbf59)

Some highlights are:

* $1.1 BILLION cash on hand
* 16% increase in ad revenue numbers quarter-over-quarter
* Decreasing their net loss from Q1 to Q3 by about $237m

I know China stocks are all the tits right now and probably about 2% of them have about any real worth and this is part of that 2%. IQIYi has positioned itself to now focus on content generation after cutting costs and released news yesterday about using AI-driven animation tech to improve content generation speeds during the animation process. Don't look at the P/E here, don't look at the EPS, streaming platforms like Netflix have similar issues with debt. This shit has real potential and incredibly high long term growth forecasts. I think the low prediction for one-year growth was $111, don't quote me on that shit.

So I was bored. Wife is out with her boyfriend, Cyberpunk was supposed to be out, NNN means I can't pull out my JPOW anime body pillow, etc. So with nothing to do and TSLA memes still fresh in the one crease on my silky smooth brain, I decided to read up on the dark arts (Investopedia) and this is what I unveiled.

AAPL is the next TSLA.

TSLA blasted off Monday after hours into new atmospheric highs. Could the voodoo have predicted this? Well let's take a [look](https://imgur.com/a/kHx0SI4). Tesla was consolidating within a pennant. Low [ADX](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/07/adx-trend-indicator.asp) (lack of clear trend) and low implied volatility also suggested Tesla was laying dormant and ready to erupt. Volume was declining since the September highs verifying bullish consolidation. During the days before takeoff, volume was dead quiet, as quiet as it was in July, where it also consolidated within a astrology triangle before a bullish breakout. Then Elon launched astronauts to the ISS on Sunday, stockholders to the moon on Monday, and call holders to Mars on Tuesday. The green dildo volume spikes this week confirmed the breakout. The rise in ADX and IV confirmed this as well. Finally, [Andrew's Pitchfork](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/05/andrewspitchfork.asp) (pink lines) is valid due to multiple reactions on the median and bottom line, which some autist named Andrew claims price will have an 80% chance of reaching the median of the pitchfork. In short, more magic lines screaming TSLA is going bigly up. 

"Oh look now you bring up this hocus pocus bullshit after its muuned. Your retard ass could only stitch this mumbo jimbo wizardry together after the breakout." 

"If this is legit, then why the fuck didn't you say anything earlier - you busy sucking dicks at the gloryhole?" (they meet COVID safety standards btw)

"This is bullshit, if you knew this where are your gains? You don't earn enough flipping burgers to where you can't afford a tier 3 Pokimane sub and TSLA fds?

"This is a waste of time, you're such a gay cucktard that you make the bull on Wall Street, who's had its balls fondled everyday for decades look straight."

Only one of these is true. And is why I present to you all üçé.

Apple is the girl you start dating, where after a few dates you find out she has a twin. Damn two hot girls that look exactly alike? You're a lucky man you think in your head. Then she takes you to her home for Thanksgiving and there you meet her sister, a celebrity. Her name's Tesla and she is S3XY. However, she doesn't look like the sister you're dating. She is the hottest girl you've seen and with curves all in the right places; it is no wonder why her assets bring her a massive cult following. This is when you realized you dated the wrong sister. But it's not like Apple isn't hot. Tesla is way out of your league anyways. With her beauty (stock) reaching new all time highs and her fame (IV) skyrocketing, perhaps you shouldn't chase. After all [Apple](https://imgur.com/a/bt0mJC6) is still hot right? They are twins and share [similar](https://imgur.com/a/ZaghU7R) features. 

Apple is consolidating in a pennant. AAPL has declining volume since the September highs confirming bullish consolidation. ADX is low as well as IV. Low IV is when options (calls and puts) are typically cheap, so preferably you want to be on the buy side of option premium. Volume last week was noticeably silent marking some of the lowest traded volume this year. Simply put, AAPL looks just like TSLA two weeks ago, ready to go bigly up or bigly down.

Let me tell you why Tim Apple is most likely polishing his rocket and not his drill. First, declining volume displays bullish consolidation. Also AAPL finished an A, B, C correction? Some tard with more brain wrinkles can explain wave theory. Second, AAPL has a valid Andrew's Pitchfork with reactions on the median and lower bound, so it has a higher likelihood of reaching the median. Third, the QQQ will print a new all time high. If SPY and IWM have printed a new all time high, whats the likelihood the monster that is Tech (up 36% YTD) would not go past its September high? Already large holdings in the Nasdaq are past the September high. For example, QCOM and particularly GOOGL. If Google can do it, why can't the rest of FANG?

"I'm scared. There's an autist here spewing shit about demonic triangles and pitchforks. All of a sudden dude starts a creepy cringe tangent about twin girls. This dipshit probably summoned a succubus with his voodoo bullshit, and gave up his soul for this shitpost"

Shrooms are fucking amazing.

Back to the topic. Don't forget Tim Apple and Papa Musk are basically [butt buddies](https://oracleoftime.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Elon-Musk-vs-Tim-Cook-2.jpg). When Apple said they were gonna split their stock this summer, who decided to throw his own tendie party weeks later? Now that Tesla is leaving the atmosphere to Mars, do you think Tim Apple will want to miss out?

"What will be the catalyst?" Fuck would I know what Tim Apple is cooking. But this voodoo astrology can smell the tendies he's about to serve.

"But but the rising cases, the winter lock down, the fundament-" Shut the fuck up. When was the last time fundamentals mattered? You gay bears like it up the ass so much, you fur fags can't shut up. Fuck the news, we'll only crash if JPOW runs out of ink and we have another liquidity crisis.

I can't guarantee AAPL will be as explosive as TSLA. It's already a 2 trillion dollar company. I can't guarantee AAPL will even go up. This post is simply an argument why it is probable it will muun. But with 3 months of consolidation and eerily silent volume, Apple is gearing up for a big move that will move the markets with it.

If you actually got this far (wtf?), thank you for letting me waste your time.

Mr. SEC, if you're reading this, this has nothing to do with the W E A P O N I Z E D A U T I S M^((TM)) where a million RH accounts with a million retards all dogpile into a few concentrated OTM positions (lol what is ITM?) forcing dealers to increasingly delta hedge their positions by buying the underlying stock. More demand in the stock (no matter how deep it is, but it often works better if it's lightly floated). This also has nothing to do with how PLTR, a relatively recent IPO, probably doesn't have that many option writers which results in a possible spike in demand for calls which not enough supply, forcing market makers to both write more calls and buy more underlying.

Case in point: MSFT during Jan/Feb 2020, QQQ during July/August, TSLA at random months throughout 2019 and 2020, and random Chinese EVs in October/Nov.

IV for PLTR 1mo 15% OTM is around 70%. That's not that high... MSFT and QQQ 1mo 15% OTM during their respective "high demand periods" had IVs near 25-35%. TSLA 1mo 15% OTM (which has always been high) was around 100% during the pre-split run, which ran up to around 180% at the end of the run.

TLDR: Buy PLTR calls (PLTR $25c Jan 2021). PLTR next meme stock confirmed. It only works if everyone believes. Also because PLTR knows everything, it probably pre-cog'd you already by buying calls for itself.

Unpopular Opinion: These Fund managers aren't here to take money from us; they're actually learning how to make money from us. ü§Øü§Øü§Ø

Think about that for one second. You think these billionaires/millionaires want a piece of our $1000 robinhood accounts?
No way, we're too poor for them to give a shit. They got better things to do than shake our weak ass hands. 

But the one thing we do have that they don't is foresight of technology. These millionaire/billionaire boomers don't know shit about tech (except that Chamath Palapitylapity mfer). It's a fckn fugazi to them. Google Warren Muffin's Phone or whatever that fuckers name is for proof. Do you see a mfin smartphone? I see a Samsung flip phone on one of Apple's biggest investors. *He's one of us!*

These mfers come here and take our hard earned DD and make money for themselves while we do all the hard work. These are the same mfers that copied homework from you in the library right before 1st period high school and got A's while your dumbass be getting C's. It's no coincidence that AMD, TSLA, NIO, PLTR have mooned the past year for being a meme. 

It's no fucking coincidence Morgan Stanley upgrades Tesla to $540 after being bearish. 

"oH? TeSlA s&P 500?? mAyBe iLL uPgraDe TeSla tO $540, sO i dOnT loOk liKe a dUmbAss lAteR". FYI Morgan Stanley upgraded Tesla to $300 only 3 weeks ago and now $540.

With that said, they're watching us and learning how genius we really are, so tread lightly on what you say.

Before that bunch of his taxi friends bought tesla (April). Before that, they talked about Shopify (2017), and before that amazon (2016).  I have noticed a  STUNNING pattern here. Whatever stock my dad and his taxi friends talk about seems to blow up. The reason being if the average joe knows about it, is discussing it with their friends and family, and showing interest in buying the stock, a lot of the Joes EVERYWHERE are probably doing the same.

Thoughts?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ The Most Popular Contracts on Reddit this Week #Which companies are Redditors betting on?

The explosion of companies like NIO and PLTR has not been missed on Reddit. In fact, [these two tickers are the most popular this week](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditTickers/), with NIO being mentioned 15,867 times and PLTR 10,570 times in the past six days (not including today).

In addition to mentioning these tickers over 10,000 times each, Redditors have bet big on the future share prices of NIO, PLTR, and other companies. In fact, Redditors have mentioned a total of over 2,000 option contracts in the past week. So, how well have these contracts performed? We can look at the 25 most popular contracts to find out:

Rank|Ticker|Strike|Type|Date|Expired|Status
:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--
1|TSLA|$450|CALL|11/20|YES|ITM

24|AAL|$12.5|PUT|11/20|YES|OTM
25|PLTR|$20|CALL|1/15/21|NO|OTM

The table below shows totals for the contracts status:

. |ITM|OTM|Total
:--|:--|:--|:--
Expired|3|7|10
Not Expired|3|12|15
Total|6|19|25

Out of the expired contracts, 30% were ITM and 70% were OTM. Notably, the AAL $12.5 PUT 11/20 expired just $0.03 OTM. The majority of non-expired contracts are OTM, with just 20% being ITM. The CRSR $40 CALL 12/18 is just $0.33 ITM right now. Currently, just 24% of contracts are ITM with 76% OTM as of market close yesterday. 

Redditors seem especially bullish on PLTR and NIO with both tickers having significantly high call volume than put volume. Redditors appear bearish on recovery stocks, including Carnival Corporation and American Airlines Group.

I know I will be watching closely to see whether the 15 non-expired contracts become ITM.

The biggest bull argument for NIO that NOBODY is talking about: Chinese AI Full-Autonomous Driving 
 
AI driving is coming, as we all should know by now. 
We all hear that Tesla is the world leader, blah blah. BUT.. they are an AMERICAN company. China will inevitably want AI driving in their country. Do you really believe they will allow American AI to be driving and collecting data on Chinese roads?  
Enter: NIO
 
NIO has proven to be able to develop AI Self-Driving capabilities and is in the process of developing fully autonomous driving. There‚Äòs a good reason China is backing Chinese-based EV companies and especially 
NIO in particular. 
 
Just my two cents. 
What do you guys think?

Bear case: [Mexico decided they'd try to deal with the problem](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-09-07/mexico-to-probe-the-diversion-of-u-s-chemicals-into-drug-trade), but it's not going away until the US gets involved. Of course, I wouldn't put it past Donnie to get involved. I get hard imagining Donnie cracking down on cartels because of r/wallstreetbets because my puts are retarded OTM.

Bull case: Psst. Hey, Mexican cartels. You should turn all the THC you smuggle into [THC-O-Acetate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/THC-O-acetate). Right now, you've got a shitty reputation across the US with regards to weed, American consumers care about QUALITY and you sell QAQA, but you can turn that around tomorrow.

Bear case: Fentanyl analogues as a percentage of total illicit opioids in US constantly increasing. AVTR, CE, EMN losing ground to China.
