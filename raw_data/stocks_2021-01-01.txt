 Down 19% on $140,000 investment in $ZM (Zoom) stock. What is your investor sentiment on its mid-long term trajectory? Hi r/Stocks,

I purchased 100 shares in $ZM (Zoom) during Q3 earnings (November) for around $470 per share. It seemed to me as if it had great mid to long term potential so I’ve been buying the “dips” since then, $ZM is now down 30% from Q3 highs. 

My total [current investment](https://imgur.com/gallery/t8VHLNz) is about $140,000 and I’m down 19% (around $25,000 less). I’m conducting research to identify whether I should hold and continue to buy the dips or sell for a loss and move on. Part of my research, is leading me to discuss on a finance forum. 

Therefore, I am writing to collect investors sentiment on Zoom stock. The question is aimed at those who study equities / those in the finance profession, not for general index fund investors. 

No one can predict the future, but we can discuss probabilities and general sentiments based on the resources (ex. fundamentals) and variables (ex. technicals) we have - that is what I’m looking for. 

What is your general sentiment over the next short term (quarter), mid-term (year), and long term (years)?

—— * EDIT * ——

I want to thank everyone for the responses and wish you all a Happy New Year!

Based on the general sentiment here, my own research, and $ZM invalidating my original thesis, I am leaning towards scaling out slowly (selling around $10K-$20K worth of shares periodically).

Yes, renewables will be the future, but any expert in the field knows that it can’t just happen in 1 or 2 years, it’s going to be a long process, so investing in some undervalued oil companies is generally a good idea. I have some stocks under my watch and I wanted to know if some of you guys had different ideas or companies to dig into. I’d like to read more about non US oil companies, like Shell, ENI, British Petroleum or Saudi Aramco.

* The market basically closed the year at ATH (3pts off) and is within a hair of 3855, which is the 138.2% Fib of the March low.
* The rising monthly channel (shown above) shows that markets are stretched near resistance and already outside of their bollinger bands. The weekly band is at 3774.
* While I believe there is room for upside into 2021, the risk/reward is **NOT** favorable here anymore. Sentiment is stretched and a correction would be welcomed with open arms.
* I anticipate a 10-15% correction to start the year, which would align us with the rising 200dma near 3219. We ended the year in a tight range, and there is potential to carry into 3855 based on January 15 open interest and gamma positioning.

Last few days I have been selling stocks and calls aggressively in anticipation of a correction. I am long TLT calls (flat) and SPY puts (down 37%).

**Sentiment:**

* The AAII Sentiment Survey is quite elevated near multi-year highs and shows overly bullish sentiment.
* The Advisors Sentiment Report reports the views of over 120 independent investment newsletters (those not affiliated with brokerage houses or mutual funds) and reports the findings as the percentage of advisors that are bullish, those bearish and those that expect a correction. The current Bull to Bear spread is one of the highest in decades, yet another indication of frothy sentiment.
* The NAAIM Exposure Index is currently at 89 and off some 100+ prints but remains elevated to the averages.
* The BAML Fund Manager Survey shows the three most crowded trades are:  

   * Long Tech via shares
   * Short USD
   * Long Bitcoin Spot via Perpetual Swaps
   * Fund managers are "all-in" on leverage. This is evidenced by our DIX print on Thursday yet again showing dark pool buying.
* Consumer Confidence deteriorated sharply in December, as the resurgence of COVID-19 "remains a drag on confidence.”
* CEO Confidence, as tracked by the Bloomberg Consumer Comfort Index hit a two week low at 47. This is the sharpest drop in economic outlook since April.

**Market Health:**

* NYSE Cumulative Adv/Dec:  

   * Actually pretty healthy right now. This is still well above all of its important moving averages and remains in an uptrend.
* NYSE McClellan Oscillator:  

   * Neutral currently.
* NYSE Summation Index (NYSI):  

   * Most commonly used by fund managers to find divergences. Above a short term 5/8 day exponential moving average is a buy signal. Below flashes a short term sell signal. This is *currently showing a sell signal.* However, sell signals in rallies tend to be early signals...
* Moving Averages:  

   * The 8/21-week EMA crossover has long been a favorite signal for momentum in individual names and also works with Indices. The 21-week EMA is important support for growth/momentum stocks. In general, you want to be long when the 8 week is above the 21 week and short when it is below with crossovers being key trend inflection signals. The 12-month moving average (MA) and monthly MACD are good longer-term risk management tools. The price action relative to the 200-week MA provides a good gauge for the health of the S&P 500’s secular trend. Pullbacks or corrections (aka cyclical bear markets) for the S&P 500 that hold above or near the rising 200-week MA are a secular bull market pattern. Pullbacks that decisively break the 200-week MA are a sign of a secular bear market. Most corrections on the S&P 500 during the 1950-1966 and 1980-2000 secular bull market held between the 100-week MA and the 200-week MA. The 2015-2016 S&P 500 pullback fit this secular bull market correction pattern. The secular bear market periods from 1929-1950, 1966-1980, and 2000-2013 saw sustained periods below these long-term moving averages. This means that the 200-week MA provides a good secular bull market risk management tool or stop loss. Using this history as a guide suggests that the Ichimoku monthly cloud is a good trailing secular bull market stop loss. History also suggests that a decisive move below the monthly cloud confirms a secular bear market for US equities. *Currently we are above all moving averages and this is a bullish signal.*

**Economics:**

* The common theme appears to be an expectation of a synchronized global growth in 2021.
* The optimism on 2021 delivering a record year for corporate profit growth and strong GDP growth around the globe is very contingent on a successful vaccine rollout. The current surge of cases and hospitalizations in the US and Europe is resulting in further restrictions and lockdowns that will weigh on growth expectations, or at least push out pent-up demand. Consumers have led the recovery so far with a boost from fiscal stimulus but the key to a self-sustained recovery is a strong capex cycle which is seen kicking off in Q2 2021. The labor market will also be in focus after record low unemployment the pandemic saw the number jump to 14.7% in April, the highest since the Great Depression, but has recovered rapidly though losing some momentum as it finished the year near 6.5% unemployment and consensus expectations to reach 5% by the end of 2021, still far-off from the 3.5% pre-crisis rate.
* The recovery has already started in 2H20 in the US & China while the European recovery has been more subdued. The driver of the strong 2021 recovery will be the full reopening of economies worldwide which makes a successful vaccine distribution critical. The US Dollar is closing 2020 weak and looks to have some structural issues with surging deficits, Fed’s intention to boost inflation, easy financial conditions, and expected economic and political improvements. The combination of easy monetary policy, a rebound in old economy industries and a global upswing in growth provides a healthy backdrop for 2021. The balance sheets of households, corporate and governments are expanding alongside the aggressive monetary policy and signs of inflation returning causing a rotation back to value and cyclical growth supported by a steepening yield curve.
* GDP is seeing rising 6.4% globally in 2021 according to Morgan Stanley, the consensus is for 5.4% growth. In the US those numbers are 5.9% and 3.8% respectively.
* Inflation would be the key risk into 2021 with it likely to start showing up in 2H21, and the risk being an overshoot could start a disruptive shift in Fed policy. Surging debt remains another concern, as a share of U.S. GDP, total debt has spiked near a record high and total nonfinancial debt has surged to new all-time highs. The rapid increase in government deficits is due to the combination of 1) the budget shortfall that already existed and was growing, plus 2) the deficit spending to fund the stimulus programs to date.
* The other clear risk in 2021 is China where debt defaults are rising and could spark a move to credit tightening and a recession that would strangle the global recovery. The overall default rate is currently low but the percentage spike in debt/GDP was the highest since 2009 which could lead to policy tightening in 2021.

**Market Valuation and Fundamentals:**

* The NASDAQ continue to outperform in 2020 with a 45%+ YTD return compared to the S&P at +15% as major secular trends in technology continue to play out. The trend of rapid rotational moves also continue with growth often seeing selling pressure for a few days before quickly recovering and resuming the longer-term uptrends. Into 2021 earnings growth is expected to be a record though room for multiple expansion is minimal. A combination of improving economic conditions causing greater business and consumer confidence should drive strong earnings growth in 2021. Increased fiscal spending and a moderation of tariffs provide additional tailwinds. In 2020 many businesses shedded labor and transformed business models to higher productivity to offset the collapse in demand and low inventories with rebounding production point to margin expansion in 2021. The 2021 environment shapes up to be one of solid earnings growth, a return of buybacks and modest multiple contraction. The growth versus value debate is likely to continue but the low-rate environment continues to favor growth, but even more-so a greater preference for quality, companies with strong balance sheets, cash flow generation, and returns on capital should continue to outperform. We are seeing historically strong earnings revision ratios and a record percentage of stocks with dividend yields above the rate of the ten-year Treasury, both conducive to allocations to equities. Compared to bonds, equities can act as a hedge in case of inflation and, with a thorough selection process, can still offer returns closer to historical returns.
* My forecasts for 2021 take into account consensus expectations, a bull case for a strong vaccine rollout, and a bear case for disruptions to the vaccine rollout and geopolicatical potential issues. I am assigning a 40% probability for the bull case, 40% for the base case, and 20% for the bear case to arrive at a S&P fair value of 3600 though 1H21. In 2H21 we start to look to 2022 estimates and feel we can approach $200 EPS with slight multiple contraction to 22X leaving upside potential to 4400 for year-end 2021.

[https://imgur.com/a/QqPjfbU](https://imgur.com/a/QqPjfbU)

* For 2021, the bottom-up EPS estimate (which reflects an aggregation of the median EPS estimates for CY 2021 for all of the companies in the index) is $169.20. For CY 2021, analysts are projecting earnings growth of 21.7% and revenue growth of 7.7%. The 6% trend growth rate since the 1930s would point to S&P 500 EPS getting back to trend levels of $187 in 2022. An optimistic vaccine scenario would see S&P 2022 EPS well above $200.

[https://imgur.com/a/lLhmsb3](https://imgur.com/a/lLhmsb3)

* The low rate environment impacts the multiple, and assuming the 10-year stays low, the Fed keeps rates at zero, and credit spreads stay firm, a valuation framework would put a trailing PE at 24X and forward at 21.5X for the current environment. The spread between the S&P dividend yield versus the corporate Baa bond yield is near historical highs and the ERP (Equity Risk Premium) is very high by many measures. Assuming the spread between the dividend yield and IG corporate yield goes back to 2012-19 levels, it would point to 30%- plus upside for S&P 500 valuations. Assuming some rise in rates as the spread narrows more from falling equity yields would point to 20%-plus upside. In 2021, policy support should remain in place to curtail risk aversion. Besides the risk of a credit crisis, concerns over a late-cycle overheating have been pushed further out due to the pandemic-induced recession and policy makers’ increased inflation tolerance. When comparing relative attractiveness across asset classes, which ultimately steers a substantial part of investment flows, equity markets continue to look quite attractive. Since the beginning of 2020, real bond yields in the USA have declined by over 100 basis points, outpacing the decline in earnings yields (inverse of the price-earnings ratio), thus supporting higher valuation multiples. Currently the difference between the earnings yield and the real bond yield as a measure for the equity risk premium (ERP) is higher than the long-term average, suggesting that equities offer an attractive excess return over bonds. Although lower interest rates support higher multiples due to the increase value of future earnings, a return to normal could push long-term interest rates higher and exert downward pressure on equity valuation multiples.

[Sector Growth Rates](https://imgur.com/a/IJPIPWW)

**Analyst 2021 Predictions:**

* Morgan Stanley: $3900 - After a year of big swings in valuations, 2021 will be about who can deliver on earnings. 2020 was all about beta and understanding how equity markets trade in and around a recession that handed us the fattest pitch we’ve seen in a decade. 2021 will be much more about stock picking (alpha) and should favor those companies that can deliver earnings growth that isn’t already expected or priced. MSCO prefers companies with earnings growth most tied to re-openings and an economic recovery and also favors small caps. Financials are also preferred due to positive upside skew on rising rates and better credit; Materials and Industrials on demand rebound, earnings leverage and inflation protection; and Health Care given its GARP characteristics and re-rating potential with fading political overhangs.
* Bank of America: $3800 - Stocks have already priced in much of the expected recovery in the economy and corporate profitability, leaving just slightly more upside heading into next year. Even as investors ride a wave of vaccine-related optimism, potential negative catalysts abound. The recovery is intact and the world likely reopens in the 2H, but a lot of optimism is priced in already on vaccine/recovery. Vaccine execution risk, delayed fiscal stimulus and longer lockdowns are risks. But a few themes support stocks: the S&P 500 dividend yield is 3x the 10-year yield, and S&P 500 dividends are set to increase in 2021. And unlike bond yields, earnings are nominal and participate in inflationary upside – where inflation risks may be running higher, given rampant money-printing and a potential post-vaccine spike in demand. BAML picks value stocks over growth, cyclicals over defensives and small caps over large caps, given each of these groups’ likelihoods to be disproportionately boosted by a post-virus economic recovery.
* Goldman Sachs: $4300 - A vaccine is a more important development for the economy and markets than the prospective policies of a Biden presidency. The economic reopening coming alongside a vaccine, in tandem with a status quo policy environment cemented with a divided government, will help push the S&P 500 to 4,300 by year-end 2021 and then to 4,600 by the end of 2022. The forecast assumes that the Senate will remain under Republican control following the Georgia run-off elections in January, the economy will continue on a path toward a “V-shaped” recovery, corporate profits will rebound, Fed funds rate will hold near-zero and the yield curve will steepen while the 10-year Treasury yield climbs only modestly.
* Deutsche Bank: $3950 - Much of 2020’s run-up in the stock market came with multiples expansion, as prices escalated despite a drop in earnings, as companies dealt with fallout due to the coronavirus pandemic. Next year, as the economy recovers and a vaccine allows for long-lasting re-openings, earnings growth will rebound and multiples will de-rate. The pattern of the equity market recovery, bottoming halfway through recession and recouping most of its losses before it’s over, has been typical but the continued run-up means valuations are high. In our reading, elevated multiples reflect increased participation of retail investors which we see as sustaining, but we expect the multiple to begin to de-rate. For 2021, a recovery in earnings — which essentially increases the denominator of the price-earnings ratio — should lower multiples. That said, an increase in companies’ payout ratios as dividends and buybacks return could at least partially offset this. A gradual correction of overvaluation argues for the current overvaluation of 5 multiple points to diminish but remain significant at 3.6 points, putting the end-2021 multiple at 20.5X.
* Jefferies: $4200 - Improving prospects for a vaccine, easy lending conditions and broader participation among cyclical and value stocks will help propel the stock market higher in 2021. November’s historic stock market rally, led by cyclical and value stocks in the energy, financials and industrials sectors, reflected broadening equity strength beyond just big tech and software shares. That rotation is anticipated to continue into next year, helping push the broader market higher. Notwithstanding the second and third Covid-19 waves permeating the world, there is a palpable feeling that the global economy is resynchronizing with the household, corporate and government balance sheets expanding simultaneously alongside aggressive monetary policy. The much-maligned value and cyclical growth sectors are slowly making a comeback as inflation pressures begin to return. This rotation has been supported by a steepening in the yield curve and with growthier stocks trading sideways. Improved visibility towards a successful coronavirus vaccine, easier lending conditions, little evidence of deflation and a sentiment switch from growth to value will lift US bank shares through 2021. Rising global capacity utilization rates, firmer producer prices, improving world trade volume, booming housing/autos and a weak dollar are the perfect environment for the S&P 500 Industrials. The S&P 500 materials sector is blowing off in response to a weak dollar, higher commodity prices, an upswing in global manufacturing and a restocking cycle.
* CSFB: $4050 - Our 2021 forecasts are designed to answer a simple question: what the future will (2022) look like in the future (end of 2021). From this perspective, we are forced to de-emphasize the near-term, focusing instead on the return to a more normal world. As we look toward 2022, the virus will be a fading memory, the economy robust, but decelerating, the yield curve steeper and volatility lower, and the rotation into cyclicals largely behind us. Since the stock market discounts future events, each of these prospects for further improvement down the line should translate into a higher S&P 500 as investors price in these events.
* UBS: $4100 - The vaccine-related developments that drove stocks’ gains in November and early December have now been baked into market expectations, leaving vaccine distribution the next milestone for equity investors to consider in 2021. The key driver of U.S. equities will be the pace of vaccinations, similar to how shifts in mobility drove equities through the spring and summer. As people get vaccinated, they are likely to ‘normalize’ spending on areas impacted by COVID shortly thereafter. We see the rotation toward cyclical services spending and other COVID-hit areas as a key investment theme for 2021. UBS is overweight the consumer discretionary, industrials and energy sectors given that consumption and production will likely rebound next year. It downgraded materials and financials to Neutral. It is also Underweight consumer staples, utilities and REITs and Neutral on information technology, but overweight communication services and health care on still attractive growth relative to valuations. UBS maintained an upside case for the S&P 500 of 4,400, which would emerge in the case of higher-than-baseline growth against a backdrop of still-low interest rates. However, in a downside case, the S&P 500 could fall to 3,300, which would entail a weaker recovery and/or tighter financial conditions.
* BMO Capital: $4200 - Heading into 2021, stocks are poised to keep reaping the benefits of the massive infusion of monetary support from the Federal Reserve, along with an anticipated additional round of fiscal stimulus. This constructive policy environment is likely to help push equities higher even as virus concerns linger for at least the first several months of the new year. Even with recent positive vaccine and treatment developments, the global pandemic and its unprecedented impact is unlikely to fade in coming months. As such, the massive fiscal and monetary response in the U.S. and around the world (also unprecedented) will likely remain in place to combat its negative economic impact for the foreseeable future. Such environments have historically supported continued stock market gains and we see no reason why 2021 will be any different. Aside from the global financial crisis, 2020 represented the swiftest quarter-over-quarter earnings collapse for the S&P 500 where index EPS plummeted nearly 50% during 1Q, thus, we anticipate that 2021 has the potential to be one of the best years ever in terms of earnings growth, something we believe will also help to push stock prices higher. We remain optimistic and expect another year of double-digit gains as the economy and society slowly transition back to normal.
* Barclays: $4000 - Markets are right to be optimistic about the global economic outlook in 2021, with growth returning and inflation rising but staying below central bank targets. Projected global gross domestic product growth of 5.6% in 2021, rebounding from a 3.6% contraction this year, with most Western economies reaching so-called herd immunity from Covid-19 in the second and third quarters of the year. Forecasts reflected the recent slew of positive vaccine results with efficacy rates exceeding expectations, which point to a significant boost for growth in the second quarter of 2021. Barclays also suggested the inflation outlook would not indicate any unwinding of current unprecedented levels of central bank support. Labor markets are recovering, but we are still at very high unemployment, so there is undeniably a lot of slack in the system. That means that when it comes to core inflation and the underlying drivers, to wage costs etc., that was unlikely to happen in the short run, meaning even next year. It would take several years really to come back. While Barclays anticipates a gradual improvement in inflation, it will not be significant enough to cause central banks to consider tightening their accommodative monetary policy stances. We have an environment whereby growth comes back, inflation stays relatively muted, and you have central banks continuing to support the recovery, and tightening is still far out.
* Oppenheimer: $4300 - The S&P 500 is likely to post another double-digit percentage gain in 2021 as the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines underpins a lasting economic recovery. This outcome is based on six key assumptions: First, that the public will expediently accept and receive COVID-19 vaccines and second, that equity investors will discount the success of the vaccines in reversing the disruptions brought on by the pandemic. Thirdly assumes that at least one of the two Senate seats in the Georgia runoff election will go to a Republican lawmaker, thereby retaining their control of the Senate and reducing (if not necessarily eliminating) the risk that the Biden administration will eradicate the corporate tax reform act of 2017. Fourth, the Federal Reserve will continue its low interest rate regime in tandem with accommodative monetary policy, and fifthly, that congressional lawmakers will step in with another round of fiscal stimulus by the first quarter of 2021 at the latest. Lastly, that investor appetite will continue to tilt toward “stocks that favor diversification and both growth and value segments of the market in a relatively low interest rate environment that favors equities, real assets and other asset classes over fixed income for intermediate and longer-term objectives. The vaccine rollout is arguably the most important in determining the trajectory of the S&P 500 next year. Ultimately the stock market is broadly dependent on economic growth to drive revenues and earnings across the sectors.
* JP Morgan: $4400 - Investors are entering 2021 against a confluence of market-positive events, including improving prospects for widespread vaccinations and sustained economic reopening, gridlock in Washington and accommodative central bank policy. Given the COVID-19 crisis, vaccine distribution is likely the linchpin event. But even with widespread vaccine availability still months away, optimism over early vaccine efficacy data has already sparked a rally among stocks hardest-hit by the pandemic. The equity market is facing one of the best backdrops for sustained gains in years. After a prolonged period of elevated risks (global trade war, COVID-19 pandemic, U.S. election uncertainty, etc.), the outlook is significantly clearing with the business cycle expanding and risks diminishing. We expect a ‘market nirvana’ scenario for equities with the melt-up continuing into 1H21, driven by earnings recovery and multiple expansion. Much of next year’s stock market rise is likely to come at the beginning of the year, as lingering uncertainties over vaccine distribution, the results of the Georgia senate race and additional monetary and fiscal stimulus start to dissipate. While the broader backdrop should still remain constructive in the second half of next year, by then the market will have likely priced in close to a full recovery and investors may start to expect a gradual shift in central bank forward guidance away from the current exceptionally accommodative stance.
* BTIG - $4000 - Global synchronized growth underpinned by central bank ease and a Washington which sees Election 2020’s decidedly mixed outcomes as a catalyst for cooperation (spend, it’s necessary) and centrist government (no tax hikes) results in a Redistribution of Wealth consistent with the 2003-06 synchronized reflation period where Value outperformed. Growth, Small Cap outperformed Large Cap, and International equities outperformed the S&P 500.

**Gold:**

* [Monthly](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/GLD/TUbcSBg2-GLD/)
* Gold had a solid year in 2020 gaining more than 20% as a long base breakout that triggered in June 2019 continued to play out higher and reached its measured move objective while the rally briefly broke above 2011 highs before pulling back. If we look at Fibonacci extension targets of the 2011-2015 correction GLD has upside targets at $207 and $220. The 2018-2020 rally has Fibonacci retracement support levels at $162.5 and $152.5. Gold rallied in 2020 on economic uncertainty and a flight to safety and has pulled back in Q4 with the greater optimism for 2021 taking hold. On an allocation basis, Gold may be losing some of its luster as a store of value with the momentum seen in Bitcoin , although that has not been seen to this point with global gold ETF inflows topping a record in 2020 as a way to diversify portfolios and hedge against inflation. However, November saw the second largest outflow on record. In 2020 the lockdowns resulted in a 5% decline in global output, so the supply-side is expected to rebound in 2021. Gold prices should be supported by inflationary pressures, a deep fiscal deficit and a weaker USD. Goldman sees Gold reaching $2300 in 2021 as recovery from the coronavirus-related recession fuels higher inflation next year. Further fuel could be added from a recovery in demand from India and China._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ My Custom Stock Screener Findings # The Metric

I recently had an idea for a metric to be used to find hot stocks. I call the metric "Price Elasticity" and it is comprised of two numbers: upturn elasticity and downturn elasticity.

* Upturn elasticity: the average % change in a stock on market up days
* Downturn elasticity: the average % change in a stock on market down days

Using these numbers and a few additional basic requirements (like positive EPS and at least 31 days of trading history), my screener found 99 stocks out of about 5700 searched that have good to exceptional price elasticities. (the list of these stocks is linked below and also [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NsbQ42oo6i3kYUWf96Tw5yK3LD04L1CR/view?usp=sharing))

# What makes for good price elasticity numbers?

I made two classifications for stocks with good price elasticity data.

1. **Irrational** \- Upturn elasticity > 1, Downturn elasticity < 0
2. **Responsible** \- Upturn elasticity > 1, 0 < Downturn elasticity < 1

With any stock I want an upturn elasticity > 1, meaning that the stock tends to move higher than the market when the market goes up. The "Irrational" classification gets its name because if a stock's downturn elasticity is negative this means the stock, on average, moves up when the market goes down. So a stock that moves higher than the market when the market goes up and also moves up when the market goes down is classified as "Irrational". These stocks tend to have less trading history and are very volatile.

Then there are "Responsible" stocks which like Irrational stocks move higher than the market when the market goes up. Unlike Irrational stocks though, Responsible stocks move lower when the market moves lower. The reason I still consider them good is because their downturn elasticity is <1 and >0, meaning that, while they do move down with the market, they move down to a lesser degree.

Some popular stocks picked up by the screener include: AMD, ADSK, ETSY, NFLX, NVDA, SHOP and TSLA. Many of the other stocks have lower market caps and could be interesting value / growth plays given they too made the cut.

&#x200B;

I have no idea if there is merit to my Price Elasticity metric (or if it has already been "invented") but it was a fun project and the screener found some interesting stocks I would have never discovered otherwise. The validity of the metric is entirely based on the assumption that past trends indicate future performance, and for those looking to beat the market the trends of these 99 stocks should be very appealing. I made the screener using Python3 and TD Ameritrade's API. Of the stocks in that list I am currently holding AMD, CAMT, EPAM, and NLOK.

Edit: Happy New Year_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Can someone confirm my line of thinking about my 2 TDAmeritrade accounts? Info in comments. I have 2 accounts at TD Ameritrade. One is a regular trading account I opened in 2007. The other is a Roth IRA I opened in 2015. I will turn 61 in April.

The regular trading account I use to "play" with stocks. I only have $5K in it.

The Roth IRA account is obviously my retirement account.

I am thinking it makes more sense to put money in the Roth IRA only since I can always withdraw contributions freely and gains and dividends are tax free. My current financial situation allows me to contribute about $5K annually into the Roth IRA. 

So again, I am thinking, say I have $1K to do something with. I should put it in the IRA so that I can make sure I am working towards the max annual contribution. And putting it in the Roth IRA rather than the regular trading acct, the tax implications are more advantageous.

I realize than any thing over the max (including the catch up) would have to go in to the regular trading acct.

So my thinking is that there is no real reason to put money in the regular acct unless I am going to exceed the max contribution amount. Even if it is to buy a stock that may be risky, speculative, a brother in law tip, etc...

It seems to be a toss-up; I 'm skeptical of putting too much weight in the polls, but I am curious to know, once things are all settled, how you think the market will react. I'm thinking that if the Dems sweep Georgia, we'll see a pump to clean energy, as Democratic Senate control will allow Biden to push his agenda easier.

Individuals who are looking to to enter and exit a trade on the same day (day trade) more than 3 times a week are restricted in doing so by the Pattern Day-Trade Rule or, “PDT”. There are important exceptions to this rule that new investors should understand and consider.

1. Does not apply to cash accounts
2. Does not apply to accounts LARGER than 25k
3. For every one account you open you get 3 day trades a week.

Assuming most of us don’t have $25,000 to put into an investing account right away and opening multiple accounts can over complicate your investing, we are going to go with **opening a cash account.**

A cash account in investing is a direct/non-credit account. This means you will receive no margin/funds from your [broker](https://tdameritrade.com/) to invest with on top of your initial cash balance. **There is no day trading limit on cash accounts**, keep in mind though this also means you will have to wait for your money to clear which usually takes 2-3 days from the closing date of a stock position. **Good news for options traders!** Funds from your daily option buying and selling are available the next day for you to trade with, without the PDT rule. Funds recieved from closing option contracts take less time to clear than funds recived from closing stock positions.

Many traders will allocate the amount of money they will use to buy and sell options. For new traders, lets say I have $1000, I am going to put $800 in long term positions and use $200 to trade options. If I buy an AMD contact for $180, even if I sell that AMD contract right after buying it, that $180 won’t be available for me to use again until it has cleared the following morning. This is one of the many reasons why it is important for small account holders to plan their trades, ensuring they will have funds available to them for their planned entrances.

That’s it… a cash account is the best option by far for aspiring day traders.\* make sure to Pay attention to the account type you have opened with your broker.

Any recommendations?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ WSE:CDR CD Projekt Red Analysis. Is it undervalued after the 37% drop due to Cyberpunk problems on consoles? **Background**

CD PROJEKT S.A. (WSE: CDR) is a Polish video game developer, publisher and distributor based in Warsaw. CD Projekt Red, best known for The Witcher series and the recent release of Cyberpunk 2077.

The CD PROJEKT Group currently conducts operating activities in two key segments: CD PROJEKT RED and GOG.com (originally as Good Old Games).

**Hierarchy**

CD PROJEKT Capital Group is headed by CD PROJEKT S.A. A holding company which has five subsidiaries.

The subsidiaries are:

\- GOG sp. z o.o (Similar to Steam, it is a distributor of games).

\- CD PROJEKT Inc (Where all the game development happens)

\- CD PROJEKT Co. Ltd (Only for selling games in China)

\- Spokko sp. z o.o. (The mobile arm of CD projekt red)

\- CD PROJEKT RED STORE sp. z o.o. (A new store of merchandise launched by the company)

**GOG -** Who have just released a 2.0 version called GOG Galaxy which subsequently entered its beta testing phase. The goal of the application is to enable players to integrate all their game shelves into a single library, to communicate with friends and to track their progress regardless of their preferred gaming platforms. Its functionality will span PC and console platforms, extending beyond the GOG.com user base. It's main selling points are that is uses the cloud, is DRM free and has a ton of old games such as Diablo, Destroy all humans etc on it's platform that Steam doesn't.

Steam is the single biggest distributor of digital games for PC, it's been dominating the market for years and has way more games than GOG does due to this. Especially as a lot of publishers do not want to host their games DRM free which GOG requires. It's very difficult to predict the future of GOG because Steam is a private company so we don't have access to it's numbers.

However the big benefit of GOG is that CD Projekt Red can sell and promote it's games directly through their own platform. The benefit being a much bigger margin on each game sold as 100% of the profit goes to CD Projekt red if a game is sold on GOG, whereas on Steam they take a 20% cut for the first $50m revenue of Cyberpunk. **One third** of all digital PC preorders for Cyberpunk 2077 sales were on GOG which is an incredible achievement by CD Projekt Red considering Steams dominance.

This is probably the reason why CD Projekt Red has such a huge operating margin from 30% to 50% in recent years. They are involved in the entire process of making and selling their games.

***GWENT: The Witcher Card Game*** is the first multiplayer game developed by the CD PROJEKT Group. It has been a hugely successful and highly rated game (which is impressive considering it's their first mobile multiplayer game). The reason why this game is important for the future is because multiplayer is the key to the cash machine which is microtransactions which the card game has.

**Cyberpunk** was released recently and had been in development for many years. It's sold very well but less than analysts expectations and there has been serious problems on console versions which led to sony removing cyberpunk 2077 from it's PS store for the time being. This caused the companies stock to plummet 37% recently.

I'll get into the numbers at the bottom for my reverse DCF that I did.

**Cyberpunk Online** multiplayer will definitely come at some point within the next couple of years. The reason being is that after GTA Onlines unbelievable success and constant revenue generation for Take Two then it makes sense to try and replicate this with Cyberpunk. This multiplayer will feature microtransactions and in my opinion is the way Cd Projekt red can really make the big $$ in the future. Microtransactions for cosmetic items like in game skins or packs (like fifa) are easy to implement and have huge operating margins as they take 0 CAPEX and virtually no time to implement due to being some simple code and designs. Here's a quote taken from their 2019 Annual Report for *Key Sources Of Revenue*:

>■ sales carried out through optional microtransactions in GWENT: The Witcher Card Game (incl. kegs and meteorite dust) via GOG, proprietors of console platforms (PlayStation, Xbox) and App Store (Apple)

**Risks**

There are some huge risks with cd projekt red, here are the main ones:

\- Neither IP, The Wither or Cyberpunk 2077 is owned by CD Projekt since the two series are based on a series of novels and a tabletop RPG respectively. So they would need permission from these license holders (the creators I think) to be able to do other spin offs for them. While it is likely the permission will be given due to the huge successes it's not a certainty.

\- CD Projekt Red relies on a couple of block busters to make 80% of their revenue and earnings. The Witcher 3 and Cyberpunk 2077 are the only revenue generates the company has (apart from GOG). If CD Projekt red messes up either of these huge IP's in the future (or like they just have with the console versions of Cyberpunk) then you can expect a huge and sudden stock price drop and potential damage to the company.

\- Because of the few but huge releases, CD Projekt Red has very volatile earnings and revenue making it very hard to predict, similar to Take Two Interactive. You can see in the following picture how sales drop a lot after release.

**Co-Founders and Board History**

CD PROJEKT has a very long tenure of the management board, all at least 10 years and 3/5 of them 20+ years. Insiders have a significant stake in CD Projekt red's stock, including the joint CEO's. This is great news for shareholders as the insiders have a big incentive to make the company work as they have big stakes in the company.

Company shareholding structure is made up of the following people:

\- **Marcin Iwinski** (Joint CEO & Co-Founder) is **13%**

\- **Michal Kicinski** (Ex Joint CEO & Co-Founder) is **11%**

\- **Piotr Nielubowicz** (VP, CFO) is **6%**

\- **Adam Kicinski** (President & Joint CEO) is **3%**

Incentives for management:

>Management goals are based 80% on net earnings and 20% on SP over the WIG index.

These are poor goals in my opinion. Net earnings can be enhanced by poor acquisitions and stock price is meaningless and should be ignored in incentives as it can produce short term motivations.

Management hit the majority of their goals for year 2019.Their goals going forward:

>Goals for 2020-2025 Aggregate Net Income: 8,300 PLN or 1,660 PLN a year.  
>  
>Optimistic goals for 2020-2025 Aggregate Net Income: 10,000 PLN or 2,000 PLN a year.

These goals seem too high in my opinion. Especially after their cyberpunk flop on consoles but it's still possible.

**Competitors**

CD PROJEKT is well known for its biggest sales on The Witcher and Cyberpunk 2077 hype. However, there’s a lot of gaming industries that compete with one another.

Thus comparing its competitors such as Take-Two Interactive, Electronic Arts (EA), Activision Blizzard has more diversified games and games produced more frequently compared to CD PROJEKT RED.

CD Projekt Red's risk in terms of competitors is releasing a big game that clashes with another big game such as GTA 6. However all gaming companies have a good tailwind right now due to COVID restrictions and microtransactions are lifting all gaming companies margins. A rising tide lifts all boats.

**Industry**

>**-** CAGR 2019-2024 Video games and e-sports growth expected to be 7% (source: PWC Global Entertainment & Media Outlook 2020–2024).  
>  
>\- In 2019 the strongest strong growth was observed in the mobile and console segments. The former grew by 9.7%, reaching 68.2 billion USD, while the latter grew by 7.3%, reaching 45.3billion USD. The PC market reached a volume of 35.3 billion USD, having increased by 2.8%.The largest share of the global videogame market is currently held by mobile devices (46%), 80% of which are smartphone releases. Gaming consoles come in second at 30%, followed by the PC 24%. Mobile devices are projected to retain their top position, with their corresponding market volume increasing by 11.2% annually (on average) over the next three years. According to estimates, the volume of the global mobile game market will reach 93.6 billion USD by 2022 (it currently stands at 68.2 billion USD).

You can see from the above as to why CD projekt red is branching out to smartphones and China.

**Reverse DCF**

Here's the original post and reverse DCF because r/stocks does not allow images: [https://www.reddit.com/r/UndervaluedStonks/comments/kofhq7/wsecdr\_cd\_projekt\_red\_analysis\_is\_it\_undervalued/](https://www.reddit.com/r/UndervaluedStonks/comments/kofhq7/wsecdr_cd_projekt_red_analysis_is_it_undervalued/)

**Conclusion**

It's been extremely difficult to project CD Projekt Red and even after doing research I am still very unsure on a bunch of variables. In my opinion the markets assumptions of CD Projekt Red's growth and margins as shown above in the reverse DCF is perfectly acceptable to me. Therefore I would not buy their shares unless they dipped to around 210 zloty\~ as I don't think they are undervalued yet. given the risks.

Fast forward a few months, the stock is now down 34.95% over the past 30 days, currently trading at $80.99. 

My initial plan for this stock was long long term. 

My rationale was:

- They’re a small company focused on COVID almost exclusively, so if successful, there should be considerable growth. 

- They’re partnered with Pfizer, hopefully this should provide some additional level of insurance. 

- At a minimum, they will be involved with the vaccination of 50 million Americans via the $2 billion order placed through Pfizer by the American government. They’re vaccinating elsewhere as well obviously. 

- Vaccine is 95% effective, etc... And, if the vaccine requires modification to treat evolved strains, BNTX has stated that can be accomplished in 6 weeks. 

For me, the big picture looked good.

Currently, my thinking is that I should just ride it out long term. Maybe once the administration changes and takes a more aggressive approach to vaccination, people will feel more optimistic. 

Or, maybe a few years down the road BNTX will be acquired...

Part obviously part of me also thinks I should stop the bleeding now before I take a complete bath. Is it possible this can drop further? I don’t have a lot of experience with biotechnology stocks.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

&#x200B;

I wanted to post about Teladoc Health. Let me know if any of this information is incorrect, but I am just posting what I've found online. I think this is an extremely interesting and unique investment. They are the global leader in telemedicine, and I believe this is the way the future is moving. A study showed that 76% of consumers are interested in virtual care after COVID, as opposed to only 11% of people showing interest before COVID. I think COVID has made a permanent, ever lasting change in the way people view health and virtual appointments. 33% of people said they would leave their current physician to access virtual care as an alternative, and 66% of patients want their current physician to partner with a telehealth provider so that they can access care virtually. 

&#x200B;

The generalized bull care for virtual health is; 1. Saves doctors and patients time travelling to and from the place of appointment, 2. Patients are more comfortable to do appointments from the comfort of their home, 3. Insurers will almost guaranteed charge less for virtual appointments. The generalized bear case would show that virtual care cannot provide sufficient details as a physical appointment would, and you cannot check normal vitals such as blood pressure, etc. Most of the time the doctor will send you for bloodwork anyways, so accessing that prescription online is completely fine. 

&#x200B;

Basing most of these financials off of their latest release (3Q2020). YoY Q3 revenues increased 109% to 289M. Total visits increased 206% to 2.8 million for the quarter. For the first 3 quarters, their revenue grew 79% to 711M and total visits increased 163% to 7.6 million. For the FULL fiscal year 2020, their **revenue is expected to grow 96% to 1.09B**. Assuming the 4th quarter visits are the same, they should have around **10 million visits for the full year**, which would be **\~140% visitation growth YoY** (in financial statements they actually say around 10.5 million visits is expected, so a little more than 140%). It is clear visits are skyrocketing and revenues are growing very quick as well. Net loss per share in 2019 was 1.38, as opposed to the expected net loss per share in 2020 to be 1.28, just a 7% increase. This would put Teladoc at a 27 P/S ratio, pretty high; and earnings are still heavily negative. They are going to burn over 100M in losses this year, and with only 1.19B in cash and 1B in debt; the fundamentals don't look all that fantastic. 

&#x200B;

Looking forward, the EPS for 2021 are expected to be a loss of 54 (per share), a 58% increase YoY, up from the expected 7% for 2020. Revenues are expected to climb aggressively again to 1.95B, an 80% increase YoY. According to 22 analysts Teladoc's first profitable year will be 2023, where they will make 163M. So based off 2 more years of  losses, this means if they continue business as is they will burn less than 200M of their 1B cash, and perhaps can use that remaining cash to worry about short term debt (which they have a lot). I could also see them doing another offering of shares to raise capital one last time for continued aggressive expansion.

&#x200B;

Teladoc has had a 67% CAGR in revenue from 2015-2020, so this basically demolishes the idea that it is a "COVID stock" or "stay-at-home stock". It has had consistent growth since 2015, but this isn't to say that COVID hasn't helped them. COVID has forced/gave people the choice to move their healthcare virtually, and Teladoc claims they have a 90% client retention rate. Meaning most people who try Teladoc once, continue to use it, a great sign. Just looking back into 2018 until now, they have provided free telehealth visits for those affected by Hurricane Florence, Lane, Laura and Sally - as well as California/Western Wildfires. With a 90% retention rate a lot of the individuals who take advantage of these visits probably stay on as permanent Teladoc patients; a fantastic business move while giving positive press regarding the company. In 2019 Teladoc also partnered with Johnston Group - in which 30,000 small to medium sized businesses with the Chambers of Commerce Group Insurance Plan would be able to use their platform.

&#x200B;

**Intel** recently donated to the **World Telehealth Initiative (WTI)**, a non-profit organization who will leverage Teladoc's telemedicine platform to expand access to care in less developed countries. Teladoc Health has received an endorsement from the **National Labor Alliance of Health Care Coalitions (NLA)** \[the largest alliance of labor unions and labor management coalitions\] and 2 accreditations though **ClearHealth Quality Institute Telemedicine Accreditation Program (TAP)**. Nationally recognized agencies are giving Teladoc public compliments. Just added publicity is good. 

&#x200B;

They have expanded to give access to virtual healthcare, nutrition services with access to actual nutritionists, mental health care services with access to psychiatrists/psychologists. Teladoc has presence in **175+ countries**, and 60 of the top 100 hospitals use Teladoc and Livongo solutions to run their operations. With the acquisition of Livongo, Teladoc has added another exceptional dimension to its business. Livongo provides managed care for chronic illness patients; it collects data and leans on artificial intelligence to come up with solutions and tips those patients to live healthier lives. On their own, Livongo are a positive earning company and have only captured 1% of their addressable market in the U.S. Primarily they deal with diabetic patients and have near-doubled their diabetic patient count in each of the last 4 years. Paired with Teladoc, Livongo believes they can offer its services to over 50,000 members with diabetes; and their solutions can be applied to many more chronic illnesses. 

&#x200B;

Teladoc also acquired **MedecinDirect** \- the market leading telemedicine provider in France. In September 2018 they announced Teladoc Global Care Services - 24/7 worldwide service. Looking at the global growth we can see from 2017 to 2019; revenue from outside-of-the-U.S sources was 19M, 75M, 108M in 2017, 2018 and 2019 respectively. Just for reference; revenue from inside-the-U.S sources was 215M, 343M, and 445M in 2017, 2018 and 2019 respectively. We can see that the proportion of revenue from outside of the U.S is growing on a % basis - a very good sign for Teladoc; meaning their goal of diversifying and expanding their network is working. In 2020 over 20% of their revenue will come from outside the U.S. 

&#x200B;

The average rating from 27 analysts is $242.78, a 20% upside from current price, with a high of $305, over 50% upside from current price. Yahoo rates Teladoc a 2.1 between a Hold (3) and a Buy (2) - closer to a Buy. On SeekingAlpha it is rated at just above a 4, which implies Bullish. Walletinvestor expects a 1-Year Forecast of $340 (71% upside), and a 5-Year Forecast of $873 (335% upside). Govcapital gives a 1-Year Forecast of $345 (73% upside), and a 5-Year Forecast of $1335 (565% upside). 

&#x200B;

Some of these values are slightly rounded, taken as of December 31, 2020. **ARKK**'s 5th largest holding is TDOC at 4.31% (3,882,585 shares at a value of $790,377,828). **ARKW**'s 5th largest holding is TDOC at 3.53% (933,334 shares at a value of $189,998,802). **ARKG**'s 3rd largest holding is TDOC at 5.75% (2,249,762 shares at a value of $457,984,050). **ARKF**'s 36th largest holding is TDOC at 1.05% (103,554 shares at a value of $21,080,488). Together this means that 4 of the 5 ARK funds hold this company. The 4 funds that do have Teladoc shares have **7,169,235 shares** at a value of **$1,459,441,168**, or an average share price of **$203.57/share** (a 1.8% downside off of December 31, 2020 closing price). In the past few weeks/months ARK funds have been buying into this company heavily. Do we really think they would invest 1.5 billion USD into it if they didn't believe it would be a good company, with good growth, near and long term? 

&#x200B;

In total there is 61% institutional holding. There is also 6% insider holding, meaning they have a lot of money in the company. In the past 12 months insiders have sold 822,242 shares and bought 104,618 shares. That means a net of 717, 624 share sold, which makes sense because it had a huge growth year. 

&#x200B;

Teladoc has a very high volatility it seems, with over 10% of shares shorted as of December 15, 2020. This is down from November in which 15% of shares were shorted. So if you are currently, or looking to invest into the Teladoc Health company, expect a high level of volatility. 

&#x200B;

**Disclaimer:** I do **NOT** hold a position in Teladoc but am heavily eyeing it. I think it shows great signs of a growth company. Another really large benefit is they are a medical stock; they do nothing but good for the people. They provide healthcare virtually in regions where doctors give insufficient care or where there is no care at all. Who doesn't want to invest in something that helps people while also getting good returns? I personally think that it seems like a sound company for a small position. 

&#x200B;

Any discussion would be awesome! As always, **do your own due diligence**, I highly encourage it. Into the New Year I wish everyone well wishes, and good luck!

Chindata IPOed early October 2020. Discovered it a couple weeks ago. They are claiming to be the largest hyperscale data center in South-east Asia. They have India and Malaysia as costumers.

Yesterday they open and closed at $19.22 and $20.19. It looked kind of bullish to me. So I placed a call that expires in February just to see if I can make a little money. Today they opened at $20.20 and closed at $23.98. I gained 123% for the day. Didn’t think I was going to make that much.

I think this would be a good candidate for long term gains. However, most recent IPOed companies tend to have a short period of rise then either level off or drop a lot then level off with a slight increase. A good example is Quantumscape (QS). I made 200% gains which was nice. :)

Also give a rough sense for the size of your portfolio... are we talking tens, hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, or millions of dollars?

Im also generally surprised that there are no ‘independent investor’ indices out there.. some index that would benchmark based on different classes of actual investor portfolio e.g. by age, occupation, etc. seems like it would be super interesting to compare ones own performance in the stock market against these more humanized benchmarks for how real life portfolios performed rather than just how stocks performed._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Advice for someone who's never dealt with stocks Reposted because I broke rule 4 by mistake. 

Never bothered to get into stocks so I don't know much about them. I understand the basics of watching changes and such but other than that I am lost.

Have around 2-3k to invest but don't know where to start. Any advice on places to learn more info in general or some relatively safe stocks to start with?

Is it better to focus on single bigger stocks or multiple smaller ones? Any advice or tips much appreciated.

Edit: should I start using apps to manage stuff or just try and learn my self?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ How should I spend my $3500 I have a Roth IRA

&#x200B;

Option 3

Any suggestions?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Automatic investing platforms Does anyone know of any trading platform that will auto invest funds transferred into the account automatically into positions pre-selected by me?

I know there's robo investors like Wealthfront and Betterment but they charge a fee to essentially invest my own money into stocks and ETF which I can do myself.

I've been manually increasing my positions month but the whole "x% of this month, buy this, y% of this month, buy that" is getting really old. 

In other words I'm looking for the ease of use on a 401k without the tax rules so I can pull money whenever I want._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Stop panicking over DraftKings I see so many people panicking over DKNG. This is simply a dip due to the last drop of shares unlocking.  If you have done your DD, you knew this was coming a long time ago.  It isn't some nasty secret.  

Here is the presentation for Q3:

Slide #5 of the presentation:

64M shares will hit the market on Jan 5.  80% of DKNG's shares have been unlocked; the last 64M shares represent roughly the last 20%.  

Are you going to panic over the last 20% of shares unlocking?  Seriously?  There has basically been no negative news that should have changed your thesis.  

Look forward beyond the next week or two in January.  DKNG may have further room to dip, but see the bigger picture.  100% of states that voted on sports gambling legalized it by huge margins in the vote.  It's rumored NY will flip.  States are reporting record numbers for their sports gambling intake. 

Stop panicking over a scheduled unlocking of shares everyone knew was coming. The short term headwinds for DKNG will finally be over for DKNG, and I think it'll be very smooth sailing in 2021 for DKNG unless something unexpected happens. There are always bumps along with way with every new stock.  For example, Snowflake will be unlocking a gargantuan 345,000,000 shares in March.  Scheduled unlocking of shares always happens with every new stock.  Nothing to be scared of, and nothing out of ordinary happening here._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Thoughts on QQQ for Roth IRA Currently invested pretty heavily in SWTSX (total US stock market index), but wondering if I should add QQQ into the equation. Long term outlook seems to be tech-centric, so would it make sense to get increased exposure to the sector? Time frame: 40+ years._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ If I place a sell order right now through etrade (after hours on the 31st) will it count as this year or next year? If I enter it in etrade today would it still count as today?

That's all I'm wondering but I need to fill more space for the question to be accepted so allow me to fill the space with a very short story. 

 

"**A Very Short Story**" is a [short story](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_story) written by [Ernest Hemingway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Hemingway). It was first published as a [vignette](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vignette_(literature)), or chapter, in the 1924 Paris edition titled [*In Our Time*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Our_Time_(short_story_collection)), and later rewritten and added to Hemingway's first American short story collection [*In Our Time*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Our_Time_(short_story_collection)), published by [Boni & Liveright](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boni_%26_Liveright) in 1925. 

In the story, a [World War I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I)  soldier and a nurse named "Luz" fall in love as she tends to him over  the course of three months in the hospital. They decide to marry, but  when the soldier returns home to the United States, he receives a letter  from Luz with the news that she has fallen in love with an officer.  Later she writes that she has not married, but the soldier ignores her.  Shortly afterward, the soldier contracts [gonorrhea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gonorrhea) from a sexual encounter in a taxi. 

Hemingway based the story on his World War I affair with [a nurse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agnes_von_Kurowsky) he met in Milan while recuperating in the hospital from leg injuries sustained at the Italian front.[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Very_Short_Story#cite_note-1)
