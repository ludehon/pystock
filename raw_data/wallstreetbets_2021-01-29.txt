This isn’t AskReddit. Some people’s kids aren’t going to eat as well because of this movement, some of your kids. A lot of you are brand new to being exposed this way, and being sensationalized into doing it harder and faster than you ever would’ve. The people who control the game are salivating over this. Learn these 3 lessons as fast as possible, I’m not saying they will save you money, but they might save you from being blindsided by reality.  

1. WallStreetBets does not care about you. You are nobody. Occasionally a person accomplishes enough to be recognizable, but it’s such a small fraction it’s negligible. You are completely and utterly alone in this game. The times that this subreddit has served as a haven for confirmation bias in times of uncertainty are the times that the most people have walked away with horrible losses. 

2. Nobody is a prophet. Nobody here is powerful enough to make plays with 100% certainty. The majority of prophets and astrologists here have ended up major losers and hated by the community. 

3. Only putting in what you can afford to lose is a fairy tale, the only ‘unrealized losses’ are the losses you haven’t realized you’re not getting back yet, and there’s no such thing as only playing with house money. Any “unrealized” gains are YOUR dollars, not the house’s anymore. And you could spend years convincing yourself you could afford to lose what you lost. That’s if you don’t pick up an addiction on the way and lose more.

I know that people are mad at Robinhood right now, but I've been thinking about this Melvin thing all week.

Now, before you call me paper-handed, I still have plenty of shares. But the news Wednesday morning that Melvin closed out its position on Tuesday afternoon caused me to sell a couple of deep ITM options that I had. These options have continued to increase in value ever since.

For anyone who needs a reminder: [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/27/hedge-fund-targeted-by-reddit-board-melvin-capital-closed-out-of-gamestop-short-position-tuesday.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/27/hedge-fund-targeted-by-reddit-board-melvin-capital-closed-out-of-gamestop-short-position-tuesday.html)

>"Melvin Capital closed out its short position in [GameStop](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=GME) on Tuesday afternoon after taking a huge loss, the hedge fund’s manager told CNBC’s Andrew Ross Sorkin."

7 U.S. Code § 9, Sec. 1 says that it is "unlawful for any person... to use or employ... any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance, in contravention of such rules and regulations as the Commission shall promulgate\[.\]" Sec. 3 says "in addition to the prohibition in paragraph (1), it shall be unlawful for any person, directly or indirectly, to manipulate or attempt to manipulate the price of any swap, or of any commodity in interstate commerce, or for future delivery on or subject to the rules of any registered entity."

I am not a securities lawyer, but it would seem to me that if this was a false statement by Melvin, that it may run afoul of the laws.

Does anyone know if anyone is looking into this? Not giving any legal advice here or tossing any allegations around, but I'd like to be connected with anyone who is looking deeper into this.

I personally hold 37 GME with believe it or not a $69.69 average. I like you all am an autist. I'm very rookie and have just finished my first year trading. I've benefited massively from the spac boom in early 2020 and have been making good progress growing my small pile of tendies to a much larger one.

I basically couldn't help my autism and went in with about 80% of my portfolio in GME with the other 20% in my favourite SPAC.

The money I have made is truly life changing for me  and like many of you I refuse to sell. Family and friends are encouraging me to sell but I refuse and it keeps paying off.

I'm a firm believer that the squeeze has yet to begin and can see us hitting $5,000 next week.

*Levi & Korsinsky, LLP, a national securities law firm that has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors, announces that it has commenced an investigation of Robinhood, Interactive Brokers, and other popular retail trading platforms on behalf of investors of GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME) who were harmed as a result of trading bans or forced liquidations involving GME shares.*

To learn more about this investigation and your rights if you believe you have suffered losses, go to: [https://www.zlk.com/pslra-1/gme-retail-brokers-class-action-information-request-form](https://www.zlk.com/pslra-1/gme-retail-brokers-class-action-information-request-form)_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Been in this bitch since $17, started with 2k and traded swings all the way up so i could maximize my shares. If I’m still in and can stomach 100k+ swings and not sell then SO CAN YOU 💎👐🏼 _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ If GME gets squeezed on Monday or Tuesday and causes their $500+ calls to go itm, won’t that force another compounding stream? This is for entertainment purposes only and is not financial advice!!!          

Crazy question: so if people who have held long positions in GME hold the past a gamma squeeze on Monday or Tuesday and it somehow pushed past the $500-580 calls, won’t that force another squeeze?       

And if people with enough shares and money to buy covering puts buy puts to cover(because if you had a huge run up why wouldn’t you want to protect against volatility? Wouldn’t that force hedge funds to short sell to cover their put positions or sell empty puts meaning there is only one direction for everything to go?      

Ie      
If someone has 200 GME stock they bought at $17 and they have the $1200 to buy the $580p assuming it goes otm with an expiration around June, wouldn’t that force people to cover their short position and increase short interest?      

This is for entertainment purposes only and is not financial advice._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Can someone confirm the Charles and TD Ameritrade did not stop trading GME _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Former SEC Senior Council Member https://money.yahoo.com/the-sec-should-have-used-its-trading-suspension-authority-dickinson-wright-chair-on-game-stop-saga-213442919.html

The tone of the former SEC senior council member Jacob Frenkel seems to be against us and said that the current SEC should’ve halted the trading of GameStop stock all together.

And just like every other big wig that’s been talking shit, a simple google search shows what they have to lose in this.

Jacob Frenkel is now chairman for JP Morgan and a defense lawyer for companies being investigated by the SEC. He went from being the person investigating for the SEC, to protecting companies from the SEC.

SEC documents for Melvin Capital shows that Deutsche Bank Securities Inc, Morgan Stanley & Co LLC, Goldman Sachs & Co, JP Morgan Securities LLC, Goldman Sachs & Co LLC, and National Financial Services LLC are the prime brokers(for retards, prime brokers are the ones who lend money/stock) for Melvin Capital.

https://reports.adviserinfo.sec.gov/reports/ADV/173228/PDF/173228.pdf

Now we don’t know the specifics on who lended the GameStop stock to Melvin Capital for shorting. Could be JP Morgan, could be multiple, could be all of them. What we do know is, JP Morgan stock, as well as Goldman Sachs, and their most profitable ETFS, such as $GVIP, have shown a pretty clear inverse correlation of GME these past weeks. JP Morgan is by far the largest lender overall, not just specifically for GameStop. We also know they went long on GameStop last summer buying up 350,000 shares of GameStop. Did they lend it out to shorters who now have to pay back their broker on it? They have to liquidate their profitable assets to cover GME, but we know Citadel will eventually run out of assets to cover it, leading to JP Morgan taking the hit. Which could be why their stock is inversing GME.

Jamie Dimon, CEO of JP Morgan, has received 5 felonies of white collar crime since 2014. We know he plays dirty with market manipulation. Not only did he not go to prison or get removed from JPM, he received a raise.

JP Morgan Shares of GameStop:

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/19617/000001961720000513/xslForm13F_X01/Information_Table_updated.xml

Just recently JP Morgan was fined $35m for market manipulation where they made over $920m in profit. What were they manipulating you ask? Precious metals market, such as silver. What have you seen an influx of on these subreddits magically this week? JP Morgan Silver. Don’t fall for JP Morgan silver, it could be JPM trying to cover their losses.

https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2020-233

TLDR; Buy GME, Don’t buy JPM silver or any precious metals, mods should actually ban precious metals, the SEC could be buddy buddy with Wallstreet, HOLD YOUR SHARES.

EDIT: I’d like to make an edit. The new commissioner of the SEC has never been in banking ever. She was first a lawyer and then has worked for the SEC for almost 15 years. Could be a brighter outlook, but you can’t ever be too positive.

EDIT 2: a tard dm’d me and told me this “The new SEC commissioner is Peter Stryoks wife. Im not sure if you know who he is but watch his congressional hearing 2 months ago where he is shammed for lying and being a cheat. Dont expect this new SEC woman to have any regards for any of us.” I take back my first edit._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Actual idiot here. Can anyone, or a group of you explain the most nuclear worst case scenario for me? It's fun, it's crazy, it's nuts to watch all this stuff in the world of gaming/tech as well as bleeding over to the financial and everything go crazy.

Today, my mothers broker called her after I told her to go bet on GME back at 38$/share. He advised against it but they yeeted some dividends at it, anyway, he keeps asking her to sell or when she's gonna jump ship and she texts and I say... hold strong mamma, we wanna be living that good life.

Now, the reality of it all, we all talking tendies and holding the line, and yes, in reality there will be those of us who do not make it to the end of the golden rainbow.

Can any autist out there describe in an event or few events just how fucking wild things must get for the shorts to actually win?

Besides the tactics they have used this week with the after hours crap, the traditional (television) news, to articles and bombarding this board. What's a realistic... like "Papa Musk just dumped 1 billion into GME shares, it jumps the price and then he dumps it" type scenario. I don't think he or actual billionaires would hop on board but short term gains, is there enough for them to bother with?  


Or if /u/deepfuckingvalue just dumps his shares then we jump ship and then I try to go pre-order Elderscrolls VI at GameStop and there is just a pair of shorts hanging on the door that says "Closed" written in sharpie.  


Edit: Should clarify.. I mean worst case for all of us. _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Can someone explain failure to deliver (FTD) to me. I feel like there’s something sketchy going on. So here we are. All these options in meme stocks just closed ITM. I’m sure a lot will be exercised. What if the counterparty fails to deliver? That means the clearinghouse is on the hook, right? That’s what clearing is. 

So in the case of RH, or anyone really, do you think they’re expecting to have to cover millions of shares when Citadel et al tell them to go fuck off and they’re not delivering shares? That would explain why everyone flipped out yesterday and why the IBKR CEO was talking about covering his own ass. 

If that’s the case, what’s the penalty for failure to deliver? Really interesting stuff I just can’t find much and I don’t know all that much about it.

Edit: I have absolutely no issue if I lose every cent in this trade. This is just something that popped out at me after the close. Yesterday’s actions by the brokers/clearing just seem to indicate that they have a very good idea shares aren’t going to be delivered and they’re about to be on the hook._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Whenever this epic saga comes to an end there are still 2 things we must band together to do. 1- **There needs to be a movie made about this story -** It needs to be done the right way. I know nothing about to go about doing it but we should crowdfund some gains together to hire a writer and producers to get shopped around to major production companies

and most importantly

2- **We need to spend some money at GameStop -** All we have heard for the past few weeks/months is how GME is trading above its value. This is said by the same people that repeat ad nauseam that a stock price is not a reflection of what's in done in the past but what it will do in the future. We are in control of what it does in the future. It's been at least 10 years since I've even owned a video game console but that's going to change. I'm going to buy a PS5 and a new TV from them. We owe it to GameStop to kick some of these gains back into their revenues.

I was okay holding it, as there will be squeeze. Till I learnt they placed restrictions which caused it. Now the problem is because of their actions the parameters have changed and we might not see squeeze over the next week and if that happens my options will expire worthless and I’ll lose 25k.

We've also seend reports of SI being HIGHER than it was previously [http://isthesqueezesquoze.com]

So, what's possibly happened here?

The current suspicion is that Melvin blatantly lied, which could be possible. Here's another theory:

Let's say Melvin did indeed cover, but other market participants who argue GME is not fundamentally sound at this price decided to open their own shorts - this means the possible short squeeze could have reset!

Why is this good? If the short squeeze reset, we basically start all over from new shorts being down 0% now. Meaning that the squeeze point now moves HIGHER than what we previously estimated. With MMs buying due to gamma squeeze, we could see even faster velocity as the new shorts start to cover. 🚀

"To avoid volatility the regulator and the SEC \[...\] have come up with the rules \[...\] They do not want add to the volatility to whatever is going on. So you can't put a limit order which is way beyond the current price \[...\]" I asked for a copy of said regulation in writing and he refused to send it to me.

When I asked what "way beyond the current price" meant he said: "twice the \[market\] price".

When I asked what trades were being restricted he said only "only the reddit stocks" and "only sells are restricted."

Is anyone aware of any SEC directive? Is it time to take legal action against CIBC?

EDIT: Although restrictions in Canada may not be as severe as the United States, the market manipulation effects everybody equally. If we were negatively effected by market manipulation, I believe that we should have a case._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ We will put apes on Pluto _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ You should know: there's other stock broker apps than Robinhood I know a lot of people here already know this,  but WSB has grown massively, thanks to the media trying to nuke it,  so I feel there's probably a lot of people here to learn. 

So,  the first thing you need to know before you get started trading/investing is that not only are there other trading apps out there,  but robinhood is genuinely the worst. I'm not just saying this because of what's going on with them these past couple days,  robinhood just sucks. 

Robinhood doesn't let you trade OTC stocks (penny stocks)

Robinhood has shitty hours. 

Robinhood has had server problems at the worst times they could have them. 

Robinhood is pulling this shit with limiting stocks, and mommying it's users.

Robinhood customer service is terrible. 

You can ask for opinions on other apps here,  most people use either TD Ameritrade, Webul,  Fidelity, or Schwab, and honestly none of them check all the boxes I'd like.... but one thing everyone agrees on is that Robinhood is legitimately the worst of all of them.  Robinhood looks nice,  but the others are just as easy to use. 

If you're looking for a broker,  don't use Robinhood. If you're currently using Robinhood,  you should start the switch to another broker immediately,  right now. 

It's really easy to leave robinhood and transfer your money to another broker. It takes minutes on your end,  then they handle the rest. Answer a couple questions,  hit send,  and the two brokers handle the rest. 

Godspeed

Edit: 

You can transfer as much or as little out of robinhood as you want. You don't have to close robinhood out to start somewhere else. 

So,  for example,  if you wanted leave Robinhood, but you don't want to sell certain stocks you own yet,  but you want to transfer any cash you have in it, you can do that.

\# Don't want to read?

&#x200B;

\- \[[https://youtu.be/knrlijBR4MQ](https://youtu.be/knrlijBR4MQ)\]([https://youtu.be/knrlijBR4MQ](https://youtu.be/knrlijBR4MQ))

\- This is the 17 minute long YouTube video along with interview with Webull CEO Anthony Denier who provided supporting evidence to everything I claimed.

&#x200B;

💎 🙌 💎 🙌 💎 🙌 💎 🙌 💎 🙌 💎 🙌

&#x200B;

\> TL;DR → Melvin Capital fucked up so bad that they were about to destroy the entire market through counter party risk leading to a massive liquidity crisis. Since Melvin and other hedge funds were too big to fail, to prevent a complete market collapse, DTC had to screw the clearing firms (who then had to screw brokers who then had to screw retail) by raising settlement collateral from 3% to 100%. This led to a tricke down effect which shutdown $GME trading (and a few others) and then drove prices low enough that Melvin Capital wouldn't collapse and take the entire securities market with it.

&#x200B;

Basically, Melvin Capital over-leveraged and was about to destroy the entire market. DTC couldn't let that happen. Thus, DTC forced retail traders to bail out Melvin Capital through a series of trickle down events that started with                                                                     DTC raising settlement collateral on $GME from 3% to 100%.

&#x200B;

In short, Melvin fucked up big so DTC forced you to bail them out.

&#x200B;

\# 1. Background Information

&#x200B;

\### How trading works behind the scenes

&#x200B;

1. DTC (Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation)

\- Monopoly that helps settle funds from trading

\- Traditionally funds take two days to settle

\- Purpose → Provide liquidity in the meantime

\- Makes sure sellers get their money when they sell

\- BUT usually requires 1-3% collateral just in case

2. Clearing Firms (APEX Clearing)

\- Intermediatery between DTCC and Brokers to clear trades

\- Pays collateral to DTCC until trade settles

3. Brokers (Robinhood, WeBull)

\- Facilitate securities exchange between traders

4. Traders

&#x200B;

\# 2. Why Was $GME Trading Halted?

&#x200B;

\### DTC without warning raised collateral from 3% to 100%

&#x200B;

\### What stocks were affected?

&#x200B;

\- $GME, $AMC, $KOSS

&#x200B;

\### What is the impact?

&#x200B;

\- Clearing Firms now have to hand over \*\*100% cash collateral\*\* to DTC for \*\*every single trade\*\*

\- AND hundreds billions of dollars are traded constantly, how can Clearing Firms handle 100%?

\- ANSWER: Clearing firms obviously CANNOT provide the required collateral

\- RESULT: Clearing firms called up the brokerages and told them to shutdown trading

\- Ex. Robinhood shutdown all selling of $GME and other volatile securities

\- Did DTC know this was going to happen? Hell yeah. They did it on purpose.

&#x200B;

\# 3. Why DTC Suddenly Required 100% Collateral

&#x200B;

\### The entire securities market was about to collapse.

You heard that right.

&#x200B;

\### What how?

&#x200B;

\- If $GME prices kept going up, Melvin Capital would be unable to pay and cover their shorts

\- Then it would trickle down to the Clearing Firms who would be on the hook

\- But we are talking about BILLIONS of dollars here

\- So Clearing Firms would be in the water and not have enough

\- Meaning, if you sell a share, you won't receive a penny because NO ONE CAN PAY

\- Result → Counter party risk → Complete market breakdown

&#x200B;

\### It gets worse...

&#x200B;

\- Clearing Firms being underwater would cause a domino effect to the ENTIRE MARKET

\- Remember, Clearing Firms help clear pretty much every security traded

\- So if Clearing Firms goes under due to $GME...

\- Then not a single security on the marketplace could be cleared

\- \*\*The entire market would collapse\*\*

&#x200B;

\### Case Study: 2008 Financial Crisis

&#x200B;

\- Remember Lehman Brothers? They were also a clearing firm.

\- Lehman was the clearing firm for many other hedge funds

\- When Lehman collapsed, the hedge funds it supported \*\*also became counter party risk\*\*

\- Result?

\- \*\*Complete market breakdown\*\*

\- Which is why the U.S. Government had to come and \*\*bail them out\*\*

&#x200B;

\# 4. Who's Responsible / Who to Blame

&#x200B;

\### So fuck DTC right? Not really.

&#x200B;

\- You have to understand...

\- \*\*DTC only had two choices\*\*

1. Leave everything as it is and let the market collapse

2. Screw the $GME holders to protect the rest of the market

\- Can't really blame them...

&#x200B;

\### Then who do we blame?

&#x200B;

\- \*\*MELVIN CAPITAL and other hedge fund shorts\*\*

\- Their greed almost collapsed the U.S. securities exchange market (potentially global as well) because they over-leveraged and shorted 140% of $GME float.

\- They made a horrible call trying to profit off of a struggling business with insane leverage.

&#x200B;

\### But who does Wall Street blame?

&#x200B;

\- \*\*Wall Street blames Retail Traders and r/WallStreetBets\*\*

\- Their reasoning → If everyday folks didn't discover our evil and irresponsible strategies, this never wouldn't have happened._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ There will be a lot of FUD in the media this weekend. Checking in to let y’all know I’m still holding 💎🙌 _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Ex robinhood user's please read this before you fuck up & can't trade. Retards,

As you are moving from RH to various others brokers, you will have to read these rules otherwise you will fuck your account and you won't be able to trade for a year.  By Default your broker will create'S a cash account for you VS RH had by default a margin Account.   

If you have a margin account then please ignore and 💎🙌 to 🚀🚀🚀🚀

If you have a cash account you can request for Margin account if you have $$ if not request might be denied. 

Examples : 

 

As the term implies, a cash account requires that you pay for all purchases in full by the settlement date. For example, if you bought 1,000 shares of ABC stock on Monday for $10,000, you would need to have $10,000 in cash available in your account to pay for the trade on settlement date. According to industry standards, most securities have a settlement date that occurs on trade date plus 2 business days (T+2). That means that if you buy a stock on a Monday, settlement date would be Wednesday.

If you plan to trade strictly on a cash basis, there are 3 types of potential violations you should aim to avoid: **good faith violations**, **freeriding**, and **cash liquidations**.

## Good faith violation

**What is it?** A good faith violation occurs when you buy a security and sell it before paying for the initial purchase in full with settled funds. Only cash or the sales proceeds of fully paid for securities qualify as "settled funds."

Liquidating a position before it was ever paid for with settled funds is considered a "good faith violation" because no good faith effort was made to deposit additional cash into the account prior to settlement date. The following examples illustrate how 2 hypothetical traders (Marty and Trudy) might incur good faith violations:

**Good faith violation example, Marty:**

* Cash available to trade = $0.00
* On Monday morning, Marty sells XYZ stock and nets $10,000 in cash account proceeds
* On Monday afternoon, he buys ABC stock for $10,000

If Marty sells ABC stock prior to Wednesday (the settlement date of the XYZ sale), the transaction would be deemed a good faith violation because ABC stock was sold before the account had sufficient funds to fully pay for the purchase.

**Good faith violation example, Trudy:**

* Cash available to trade = $10,000, all of which is settled
* On Monday morning, Trudy buys $10,000 of XYZ stock
* On Monday mid-day, she sells XYZ stock for $10,500

At this point, Trudy has not incurred a good faith violation because she had sufficient settled funds to pay for the purchase of XYZ stock at the time of the purchase. However:

* Near market close on Monday, Trudy buys $10,500 of ABC stock
* On Tuesday afternoon, she sells ABC stock and incurs a good faith violation
* This trade is a violation because Trudy sold ABC before Monday's sale of XYZ stock settled and those proceeds became available to pay for the purchase of ABC stock

**Consequences:** If you incur 3 good faith violations in a 12-month period in a cash account, your brokerage firm will restrict your account. This means you will only be able to buy securities if you have sufficient settled cash in the account prior to placing a trade. This restriction will be effective for 90 calendar days.

## Freeriding violation

**What is it?** While the term "freeriding" may sound like a pleasant experience, it's anything but. A freeriding violation occurs when you buy securities and then pay for that purchase by using the proceeds from a sale of the same securities. This practice violates Regulation T of the Federal Reserve Board concerning broker-dealer credit to customers. The following examples illustrate how 2 hypothetical traders (Marty and Trudy) might incur freeriding violations.

**Freeriding example, Marty:**

* Marty has $0 cash available to trade
* On Monday morning, Marty buys $10,000 of ABC stock
* No payment is received from Marty by Wednesday's settlement date
* On Thursday, Marty sells ABC stock for $10,500 to cover the cost of his purchase

A freeriding violation occurs because Marty did not pay for the stock in full prior to selling it.

**Freeriding example, Trudy:**

* Trudy has $5,000 cash available to trade
* On Monday morning, she buys $10,000 of ABC stock with the intention of sending a $5,000 payment before Wednesday through an electronic funds transfer
* On Tuesday, ABC stock rises dramatically in value due to rumors of a takeover
* Later in the day on Tuesday, Trudy sells ABC stock for $15,000 and decides it is no longer necessary to send the $5,000 payment

A freeriding violation has occurs because the $10,000 purchase of ABC stock was paid for, in part, with proceeds from the sale of ABC stock.

**Consequences:** If you incur 1 freeriding violation in a 12-month period in a cash account, your brokerage firm will restrict your account. This means you will only be able to buy securities if you have sufficient settled cash in the account prior to placing a trade. This restriction will be effective for 90 calendar days.

As these examples illustrate, it's easy to encounter problems if you are an active trader and don't fully understand cash account trading rules. It is important to maintain sufficient settled funds to pay for purchases in full by settlement date to help you avoid cash account restrictions.

## Cash liquidation violation

**What is it?** A cash liquidation violation occurs when you buy securities and cover the cost of that purchase by selling other fully paid securities after the purchase date. This is considered a violation because brokerage industry rules require you to have sufficient settled cash in your account to cover purchases on settlement date. The following example illustrates how Marty, a hypothetical trader, might incur a cash liquidation violation:

**Cash liquidation violation example, Marty:**

* Cash available to trade = $0.00
* On Monday, Marty buys $10,000 of ABC stock
* On Tuesday, he sells $12,500 of XYZ stock to raise cash to pay for the ABC trade that will settle on Wednesday

A cash liquidation violation will occur. Why? Because when the ABC purchase settles on Wednesday, Marty's cash account will not have sufficient settled cash to pay for the purchase because the sale of the XYZ stock will not settle until Thursday.

**Consequences:** If you incur 3 cash liquidation violations in a 12-month period in a cash account, your brokerage firm will restrict your account. This means you will only be able to buy securities if you have sufficient settled cash in the account prior to placing a trade. This restriction will be effective for 90 calendar days.

Proudly made by u/ptgauth and I in the last 20 hours or so. _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ A breakdown of how the short squeeze started and what’s going on with brokerages. GameStop short float is currently around 250%. 

For a second, let’s just imagine there are only 100 shares total of GameStop.

This means that person A owns 100 shares. Person B is a short seller and borrows them, sells them to person C who buys them. At this point the stock is 100% short.

Person C then lends those shares to Person D who is a short seller who then sells them to person E who buys them.  The stock is now 200% short. 

Person E lends 50 of them to person F who is a short seller who sells them to person G who buys 50. The stock is now 250% short

So now person A, C, and E all own the same 100. The brokerage sights are limiting buying because they are attempting to unwind that! If everybody right now demanded their shares. The brokerage sites should be on the hook for $34.5 Bil worth of stock that doesn’t exist.

That’s fucked up but here’s where it gets crazy. 

There were never any controls on monitoring if somebody’s shares had been sold short twice. 

When a short seller sells shares. They are immediately paid. So cash is in their accounts. 
When a person buys shares they pay money out and theoretically own shares. But because the short selling wasn’t tracked brokers do not possess the shares they were putting into the market. If everyone were to request their shares they would default on their obligations and fold. Meaning they only have 100 shares and person A, C, and E all have a claim to those shares. Meaning the buyers are left fighting over who has shares. And the short sellers are left holding the cash they collected. 

It gets super messy. 

If Robinhood were to default. Short sellers win. Then most likely the fed has to come in and save the buyers spending tax dollars. That’s why the fed is getting involved.

By limiting shares and removing the ability to continue to short, they are trying to unwind this mess without it causing a panick.

That is why the broader market is down. 

Not because of shorts covering... but because of the potential for brokerages to collapse. 

I’m guessing Robinhood, TD, IB, and E-Trade are on the hook for a vast majority of the shares that don’t actually exist but multiple people own.

Imagine if person A says he doesn’t want to lend his shares.  The broker and clearing house has to figure out how to balance person B-G sourcing shares from somewhere else.

If the brokerages don’t go under. Short sellers, the hedge funds, are on the hook. 

If they do go under... economic recession. 

Retail investors once again left holding the bag.

Institutions don’t use these little guys. They use IB to trade and then they have the physical shares transferred into accounts at 5/3rd. If IB were to go under their fund would be fine. But most brokerage accounts are only insured up to up to $250k.

This is a failure of the system as a whole. This is a problem created by the top .001% and they are trying to call it a Reddit rebellion. Fuck that. 

This is totally a short selling fault. I think the outcome of this is that short selling gets banned.

Edit: Changed we to they, our to their. I’m not a hedge fund manager I’m a retail retard like the rest of you who just wanted to spread some information.

this post is for entertainment purposes I'm a fucking monkey who just found about this computer thing ooo ooo aah aah_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ ATTENTION: Looking for ALL who suffered a loss via any restricted equity in the last 48 hours as a result of ANY trading platform (details below - this is going to be the one you want to read in) In  the last 24 hours, there have been 5 class action suits filed against  Robinhood for their actions yesterday.  However, 4 of those 5, the class  lead is a Plaintiff that didn't own shares of the affected stocks and  were people who were forbidden from buying them.  They essentially  boiled down to a person searching for a stock, not being able to find  it, and claiming damages from that.  Only one of the 5 - the one filed  in the 10th Circuit, District of Colorado - is led by a Plaintiff who  was actually IN these equities, sold some shares after the restriction  occurred, and has actual tangible damages as a result of the trading  platforms.  As a result of this and the fact that this is the only one  that is suing more than just Robinhood (it's also going after all the  major trading platforms, Apex and Citadel), it's highly likely that this  particular one is the one all the other class actions are going to get  rolled into, even though the New York one was filed first.  It's also  the only one of the 5 led by a firm that specializes in class action.

I've  been in contact with the lead in this case (I'm backing it, in fact), and the firm is looking for  all other people who have demonstrable losses and damages as a result  of RH, TDA, Schwab et al's actions as they compile their opening salvo.

The  firm representing the action in the 10th Circuit is the Hannon Law  Firm, and the case is being speared by founder Kevin Hannon.

This groundswell of retards LIKING THE STOCK is the best marketing campaign EVER. WSB now has 6M users. Let’s say half of them buy video games, that is 3M people who will now exclusively buy from GameStop.

E-Commerce companies trade at high tech multiples, as opposed to seedy mall location video game store multiples. The biggest cost to e-commerce is marketing. It is all about thin margins, and more sales, driven by digital marketing campaigns. Maybe the entire physical mall footprint of GameStop is worthless, but people start downloading their call of duty through GameStop, or they partner with activision or EA. The brand name and popularism now has a huge intangible value. 

This is the thing I keep thinking about — if something like DOGCOYN, a literal joke, created as a joke, can have a $10B market cap from retail buying, why can’t a company like GME that trades like PEOPLE LOVE IT have a market cap of $50B if the masses decide and the momentum institutions follow?

A small snippet from Robinhood's disclosure states:

"ONE OF THE FIRM'S PRIMARY SELLING POINTS WAS THAT IT DID NOT CHARGE ITS CUSTOMERS TRADING COMMISSIONS. IN REALITY, HOWEVER, "COMMISSION FREE" TRADING AT THE FIRM CAME WITH A CATCH: THE FIRM'S CUSTOMERS RECEIVED INFERIOR EXECUTION PRICES COMPARED TO WHAT THEY WOULD HAVE RECEIVED FROM THE FIRM'S COMPETITIORS. FOR LARGER VALUE ORDERS,THIS PRICE DIFFERENCE AT THE FIRM EXCEEDED THE COMMISSION ITS COMPETITORS WOULD HAVE CHARGED. THESE INFERIOR PRICES WERE CAUSED IN LARGE PART BY THE UNUSUALLY HIGH AMOUNTS THE FIRM CHARGED PRINCIPAL TRADING FIRMS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO OBTAIN THE FIRM'S CUSTOMER ORDER FLOW. THESE PAYMENTS ARE GENERALLY REFERRED TO AS "PAYMENT FOR ORDER FLOW." CERTAIN OF THE FIRM'S RETAIL COMMUNICATIONS OMITTED ITS RECEIPT OF PAYMENT FOR ORDER FLOW. SINCE THE FIRM'S LAUNCH, PAYMENT FOR ORDER FLOW HAS BEEN THE SINGLE LARGEST SOURCE OF REVENUE. THE FIRM'S CUSTOMER AGREEMENTS AND TRADE CONFIRMATIONS STATED IT "MAY" RECEIVE PAYMENT FOR ORDER FLOW, HOWEVER, IN FAQS ON THE FIRM'S WEBSITE DESCRIBING HOW IT MADE MONEY, AND IN CERTAIN COMMUNICATIONS WITH CUSTOMERS ADDRESSING THE SAME ISSUE, IT OMITTED PAYMENT FOR ORDER FLOW WHEN IT DESCRIBED ITS REVENUE SOURCES BECAUSE IT BELIEVED THAT PAYMENT FOR ORDER FLOW MIGHT BE VIEWED AS CONTROVERSIAL BY CUSTOMERS. THE FIRM ALSO INSTRUCTED ITS CUSTOMER SERVICE REPRESENTATIVES NOT TO MENTION PAYMENT FOR ORDER FLOW IN RESPONDING TO QUESTIONS ABOUT ITS SOURCES OF REVENUE."

Listen here, lads. The stuff we do here? It's an historic, unprecedented event, and you are on the good side of it, no matter who will win and who will write the history books. It's not about the money anymore. Look what you've done: politicians of opposing parties agreeing with each other, support from the billionaires, celebrities, athletes, even Mia Khalifa lmao. Brokerages losing their shit and breaking law in broad daylight, everyone exposing crooked hedge fund managers, finding apparent connections between the White House and Citadel, TEACHING people about the stock market and its fundamentals (holy fuck guys, just realise how many people learned what short squeeze is this week)!

Doesn't matter if you are the OG or just hopped in, if it's $10 mln or your $20 life savings. You will be remembered, and if I ever meet someone in real life who'll tell me they fought against the criminals in suits, I'll gladly buy you the cheapest piss beer and drink with you at the dumpsters behind Wendy's. Some people found purpose because of you, and this is no fucking joke. You united more people than you think - this is a financial revolution, first one in the era of digitalisation.

I'm fucking proud of all of you, and happy for every cent you'll take from these greedy bastards. You should all be proud of yourselves.

This is far from over, so remember - **hold the fucking line.**

Pay him respect Y'all probably wondering, how did those manipulative hedgecunts allow us to close above 320. If you note, there were insane volumes during closing, but price remained steady. Because when the hedgecunts where manipulating it to go down and crash, several people found out the technique to buy excercisable calls with almost no premium.

We bypassed the ban on buying more shares and were able to keep the momentum going above 320.

We won the battle, and are well on our way to win the war. Since it closed above 320, millions of calls will be exercised and the gamma squeeze has officially begun. All we have to do now is HOLD. Just chill during this weekend for we have a war to win next week.

I don't know if the technique will work on Monday, and if it does, anyone looking to buy 100 shares or more can do it. Remember to remove stop losses, and set limit higher than 1,000$

Hello ladies and gents,

What a week. What. A. Week. Congrats to all of you that held. To all you that sold, thanks for the shares, I'll send you a personalized postcard from Mars.

I was watching the Options Chain for next week closely today on Schwab and I want to call attention to the $800c ending next week. Now before I go into the volume of trades, I want to note that the price range of this contract didnt move much. Opened at $47 per share dipped a bunch and closed out today flat. Now to the volume of this puppy. There were a total of **10,500** calls purchased today. The second highest call option volume on this chain was the $570c with a little over 1,000.

Let me do some simple math for you sexy smooth-brainers:

$4700 (cost per contract) \* 10,542 = **$49,547,400**

Now I am not sure if this is just a collective group of us just going straight YOLO and feelin ourselves (i mean we have been making a good chunk of change) but this is a MASSIVE order that consistently piled on throughout the day.

Institutional buyers getting ready for the price to continue chugging forward next week?

WSBabes figuring they YOLO on all the cash they made from closing ITM calls today?

&#x200B;

I took the call graph from [this link](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/options?p=GME), threw it in excel, added up the total "open interest" column and multiplied it by 100. It came to the following: **call options for 9.2 million shares expired ITM today**. That's 20% of the float.

&#x200B;

I'm a noob so I'm not sure how many of these will be cash settled or share settled. But if even 20% of these are share settled, then that's 1.84m shares that need to be provided to individuals whose options were exercised.

&#x200B;

This is likely very good for us as it will increase buying pressure by MM's,  decrease share liquidity and makes it harder for the shorters to cover. However there is also a potential down side as many of those call options could have been purchased by the shorters during their short ladder attacks. This would allow them to generate gains on the way back up so they can continue to fund their short position and manipulation tactics.

&#x200B;

Please let me know if any of you OG's can help clear up any of my misconceptions?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Edit: Thank you for clearing up my error! (I multiplied the open interest by 1000 the first time) 9.2 million shares is MUCH more reasonable. But still great! Keep holding boys!

Also the non angry rant parts are in bold.

We know you want to dump them and you bloody well should.

**What you should not do is initiate a transfer.**

Protect your tendies and play your positions otherwise you'll be 
cutting off the nose to spite the face.

**A transfer will lock your account and take a little over a week, probably longer as there might be a spike.**

**It also costs you $75.**

**What you should do is open a new brokerage account ASAP.** Wire some dollars in to fund it as some brokers are more strict until your first funds clear. Also to give time for the identity checks to happen.

*(Someone please post the image with Brokers that didn't restrict)*

**As your positions finish in Robin Hood (e.g. sell out). You should move the cash to the new broker and start new positions.**

I know it's frustrating but imagine getting stuck in something like this again! RH just stopped CC.IV as well.

They are so evil that they limit to one so they can tell and have the media report that buying is limited.

What the fuck reason does someone have to own one $20 stock?!?

It's a halt!

**Then when you have transferred the last of your tendies.**

#DELETE THE ACCOUNT!

RH is coming up on an IPO. Lessen their account numbers! Hit them where it hurts.

Do you keep your Wendy's tendies box when you've finished stuffing them down your gob?

No, you throw it the fuck away.

No one is gonna be cross at you for using them for a bit longer while you properly extract your positions.

Good luck

The idea that it will take shorts many days to close their positions seems absurd to me when you look at the volume numbers. 

S3 Partners estimates that the current short interest is 113.31% 

https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355194252674953219?s=20

What the Fintel and S3 Partners data tells me is that some shorts have closed their positions over the past week and been replaced by new shorts. I don't think Melvin Capital and Shitron were lying when they said they closed their positions. They have been replaced by other hedge funds. S3 Partners shares this view.

https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355234358194556928?s=20

I want to dispel the notion that shorts can't possibly cover in one day. It would be a colossal rip the likes of which we've never seen before, but I think they can. I personally don't see that happening unless fear takes hold and enough of them decide to close their shorts at the same time. These guys have deep pockets though. We already knew that. Many of them entered at the highs or rolled their shorts to higher numbers. They can afford to wait, but so can we. This is simultaneously a game of chicken and musical chairs. Nobody here seriously believes that GameStop is currently worth these prices, but it doesn't matter. We knew this was a risky play from the beginning. Short interest is still over 100% of the float, meaning that when the music stops, it is entirely possible for every single retail trader to end up in a chair while hedge funds are left holding the bag for once. I fully expect Robinhood and other brokers, clearing houses, and DTC bullshit to continue along with media FUD. When that happened yesterday, people panicked, paper handed, and sold, allowing 5 million shorts to close their positions. The hedge funds are betting on YOU losing this game of chicken.

I think we have been in the short squeeze for a while now. The question is how it ends. The current short interest is still fairly high as some hedge funds have either doubled down or rotated out and new ones have taken their place. I expect that to continue. I'm not sure there's going to be a meteoric rise as hedge funds panic and trample each other in a run for the exits, but I think it's certainly possible for it to happen in one day. It may just continue along the current trajectory as they slowly close out their short positions. If they do it slowly, there won't be a painful rip. But, there is still rocket fuel left.

I don't know how this thing ends. I just wanted you to have as much information as possible, because I love you retards.
