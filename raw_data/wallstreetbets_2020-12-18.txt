 After waiting 1 year, today my TSLA shorts paid off big time. _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Palantir is tracking the Russian Hackers Oh Hi Guys.

When the US Government reveals (or not due to secrecy) that Palantir is tracking the Russian hackers...

I believe a generalized Cyber Terrorism statement could be made soon that will roast FireEye and Microsoft investors and hurl PLTR shares upwards.

Just an idea that might effect your options trades in the near-term....

This will demonstrate that their solutions are years ahead of its time...

&#x200B;_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Credit Suisse is a reputable bank _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Sold TSLA at $695 today Feel like I won the TSLA S&P inclusion non-event today.  Was watching the last 5 minutes anticipating a run-up for the closing cross.  The stock went from +3% to -3% back to +2%.  I decided to put in a limit sell order for all of my 401k shares as I assume I can buy it back after the dip next week cheaper.  Initially I had it set at $700/share, but thought others might have set that price, so settled on $695.  As the market closed, the stock price didn't go up the max 10% I thought might happen.  However, when I checked my portfolio.  The sell order went through!  lol someone had a market buy order for all of my shares!

I still hold the majority of my shares in my individual trading account as I don't want to pay taxes yet.  Closed out most of my near term calls for about $400k profit but still holding a bunch that are deep in the money.  CNBC is showing my sell price as the closing price!  In fact, TSLA would be up after hours if it wasn't for my sale lol

First I noticed a bunch of sellers appearing on the footprint. buyers then came in to absorb the pressure by refreshing the bids. there was a large battle where sellers eventually gave up. loaded 2 contracts long and the next candle we melted up.
i dont know why more of us dont trade futures. its an absolute gold mine.

Please come forward if you wish _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Bagholding TSLA, NIO calls over the weekend because I feel asleep I bought some 620c/21/12 and sold some 620c/14/12 calls on tuesday (\~18 cost basis) hoping to make a quick bunch on tesla trading sideways (<650-660) range by the weekend. Were doing good till yesterday until tesla went up crazy and I was expecting for it to come back to earth by today end (which it did). But being the autist I am this is all on robinhood and ofcourse I decide to take a short nap at 10am PST to wake an hour later. Didn't wake up, Robinhood sold my short for (\~49) one hour before close and now I am bagholding it over the weekend with a cost basis of (\~67). Funny thing is if I was awake and this happened, totally would have panic sold at near close but now I am bagholding over the weekend shit scared it will drop. Now I am riding Tesla to the valhalla

PS. Also have some similar NIO 42c 31/12 whose short got sold as well (cost basis 4.75)

PPS I know I am an idiot for doing multi leg stuff on robinhood. Will switch to thinkorswim after new year.

Positions - NIO 42c 31/12, TSLA 620c 21/12 (currently -1700)

Edit cause bears gotta be üåà: 

Lockup will have 3 days after their Q4 earnings release probably sometime in Feb2021 the number of outstanding shares to be traded will go from .5b to about 1.7b. This might seem bad but if you are concerned you just need to look at snowflake's recent lockup expiration to get an idea of what might happen.

Snowflake had a partial lockup release earlier this week and their float went from 32.2M to a total of 110.6M overnight. This is roughly a 3.4x increase in float volume. PLTR is going from \~.5B to \~1.7B float (a 3.4x increase in float). When the lockup expired for SNOW their SP dropped by \~15% and it is now recovering. So we can expect a \~15% drop once this lockup is done._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Market Makers sent us a message in the VIX!

MAD MONEY**

**Cramer**: We are here in Denver to talk to CEO of Palantir, Alex Karp.  Since [demo day on January 26,](https://palantir.events/livedemoday) we‚Äôve seen a very interesting strategy for Phase 2 and we will hear more insights on the plan.

**Cramer**: Alex, thanks for joining us. 

**Karp**: Thanks for having me. 

**Cramer**: I‚Äôm a full blown retar-... scuse me, redditor now, and the question everyone is dying to ask is ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs with that hair?‚Äú

**Karp**: You look at what Einstein has done, he made huge breakthroughs that changed the world.  That‚Äôs what we‚Äôre poised to do here at Palantir. And my hair is a nod to that brilliance.  Crazy hair is brilliance in the making. 

**Cramer**: In the live WSB discussions about 500 people are yelling that hair is an autist move. Thoughts on their reaction?

**Karp**: I have Aspergers. Like I fucking care.  

**Cramer**: Your margins and revenue beat expectations in Q1. Your stock has since doubled. The short position has also gone up by 10x doubting your Phase 2 expansion. Walk us through your next plan.

**Karp**: We call it Project GOTS. We built teams and a strategy to focus on addressing more purpose built applications to aim at a few sectors. Healthcare, CPGs, HR and Energy. 

These are underserved markets in dire need to make sense of their data in a more efficient way. Our product lines Gainer, Opus, Target, and Synergize will address these areas.

**Cramer**: That‚Äôs fantastic. And sounds intere... wait a minute WSB live is going nuts again. They‚Äôre all spamming... umm, we heh, can‚Äôt say this on the air. Umm, can you inform the audience on the Phase 1 product lines?

**Karp**: Yes. Phase 1 was mainly to serve the broad areas: enterprise data, expanding data analytics and Saas management. Our product lines are called Foundry, Apollo, Gotham.

**Cramer**: Wow, was that on purpose?

**Karp**: Yes, we wanted to get into areas that were...

**Cramer**: No, I‚Äôm talking about the names.

**Karp**: What about the names? Our employees voted to name our product lines.

**Cramer**: So you‚Äôre saying, you have a company culture that promotes F.A.G. products. And your phase 2...

**Karp**: Yes, Tesla wanted to literally sell sex. We were inspired.

**Cramer**: So you want to sell a bunch of F.A.G.G.O.T.S.

**Karp**: As much as possible.

**Cramer**: Wow.

**Karp**: Look. We are focused on doing the impossible. And being the most important software of the 21st century. Our product lines are unified to address that.

**Cramer**: They certainly are. Nobody can deny that naming convention.

**Karp**: We knew there would be controversy. But just like anything bold and risky, it‚Äôs free advertising. You might think it‚Äôs a dumb move but you are already giving me free press. Pretty soon every man, woman and child know we are in the business of F.A.G.G.O.T.S.

**Cramer**: Huh. I hadn‚Äôt thought of it that way.

**Karp**: No shit. It‚Äôs kind of like my hair. Looks awful at first glance, but the more you think, you realize it‚Äôs brilliant.

**Cramer**: I wish I had hair. 

**Karp**: OK Boomer.

**Cramer**: What?

**Karp**: OK Cramer.

**Cramer**: Haupt91 in the chat has said, ‚Äúis Gainer a diss on Gay Bear? They sound similar.‚Äù

**Karp**: This guy fucks... Gay bears to be specific. Yes, we wanted our own ‚Äúshort shorts‚Äù like Elon. Why not have a slight to our doubters right in the name.

**Cramer**: Amazing and unique strategy. I know you are a busy man, so, Alex, thanks so much your your time. This is very informative. 

**Karp**: The business world will be swimming in F.A.G.G.O.T.S. Just watch. It‚Äôll be an exciting business terraform that no one will forget.

**Cramer**: Thanks for tuning in to Mad Money.

The move adds to an industrywide effort to reduce reliance on Intel's (INTC) chip technology, King and Ross say.

I'm a three year vet at wall street bets I have 0ed my account twice, watched it go to -90% a couple more times. I marched with my brothers on PLTR, AMD, CRSR, GME earnings and have resurrected my account(except GME). I have seen my account hit 25k and am back to 18k(+150% all time). I will now march again into the darkness to be victorious and make it to tendy town or be slaughtered by the the thousands.

Fundamentals 
Unemployment numbers 
885,000 total vs 808,000 expected
unemployment is simply bad no more needs to be said.

Consumer spending power is going down
Every state is seeing a decline in personal income. This will affect most companies and will lead to unimpressive Christmas sales.

The US dollar is weakening and will only continue on the next Stimulus 

The stimulus
Its underwhelming not sexy at all. Wheres my Trump bucks????????

Countries all over the world are reaching all time highs as their government desperately try to sell their bonds its simply not healthy. 

All the firms know this cannot last there has to be a pull back and when it does they will end richer than they were before. They hold this up by buying stocks. I do not know if they know options exist yet but I hope no one tells them they are doing it wrong.

Technical analysis
This Market has been gapping up in the am only to maintain and live off of the sweet power hour. Good luck finding support on the way down. 

Stay careful out there brothers. Only risk what you are willing to lose.

I figured oil was still gonna be useful in the post-apocalypse and bought some USO fund calls. My thinking was that this couldn't go tits up.

I own these contracts:  
Exp 12/16/22 10x5c 10x7.5c 10x10c

The fund then reverse split so each of these contracts is apparently worth 12 shares of USO + $8.18.

Since the volume is so low on these adjusted options, I'm trying to figure out what the value of them is.

Today's price of USO is \~33.5

The question: Are these things worth

\# contracts \* 12 \* (USO price - strike) + # contracts \* $8.18 

10 \* 12 \* (33.5 - 5) + 10 \* 8.18 = 3501.8

10 \* 12 \* (33.5 - 7.5) + 10 \* 8.18 = 3201.8

10 \* 12 \* (33.5 - 10) + 10 \* 8.18 = 2901.8

Takeda Pharmaceutical (TAK), largest Pharma company in Japan and top 20 pharma company in the world by revenue was just granted a priority review by the FDA for their drug.

The drug is designed to fight the eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), chronic inflammatory disease. 

"*The FDA grants* ***Priority Review*** *for medicines that, if approved, have the potential to offer significant advances in the safety or effectiveness of the current treatment approaches. TAK-721 previously received both Breakthrough Therapy designation and Orphan Drug designation from the FDA.*"

Now you ask, why the fuck do I care about this? Not a boomer, won't die from it. Fair. But you like Tendies. See below.

Free charging for EVs._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ FUBO - Gravy Train to Tendy Town Listen up you sad sacks of missing chromosomes, FUBO TV is headed to the Androdema galaxy. In fact, it's ticker stands for "F*cking Unreal Bigly Options." I've been printing with PINS, NIO, CRWD, and NET since early 2020 so figured I'd share this next pick.

I know you retards don't read much, so **TLDR: BUY FUBO, it has bigly upside with tiny downside. It's a sports streaming company that fused with a sports betting company.**

**Positions: 1000 shares @ $19.43 avg, 5x Dec 2021 $30 LEAPs.**

For those who can read at a 2nd grade level:

Netflix has regular cable and Fubo TV basically has the market by the nutsack for sports streaming. It's product is smooth, continuously being improved, and people who have it love it. Even though it currently has a $64.99 monthly price, people are still flocking because people who watch sports usually spend most of their time doing that to imagine what their highschool football career could have resulted in. Pathetic, but that's what allows us to ride the gravy train to Androdema.

For perspective, the average revenue per user has gone from 2018: $37.93 2019: $53.73 3rd Quarter 2020: $67.70

Impressive, right? Some may cal that retard strength. What about revenue? 2018: $74.8 million 2019: $146.5 million 2020: BIGLY GROWTH, TBD. Not to mention analysts have been loving this with price targets up to $40.

On top on all this, FUBO is engulfing retards left and right. It combined with Facebank AG, the company who did the Tupac halogram at Coachella and purchased Balto sports, a sports betting company competing with Draftkings. Combine retards watching sports with lots of money since they went into Finance instead of pursuing their true dream and direct marketing for sports betting and you have a Powell money printer.

Stack this with it's Glassdoor info: 91% recommend working at Fubo 100% approve of the CEO, David Gandler

It's been shown time and time again how much influence proper working conditions have on stock growth. When people feel like a team and approve of the CEO, they get retard strength and grow.

Finally, the market cap of this stock is ~$2.5 billion. While this won't be a Netflix with a market cap of $250billion, it is FAR from it's peak.

Hop onto the gravy train straight to tendy town so we can win back our wives.

Brandon Smith does not own one of Tesla Inc.‚Äôs sleek electric cars. In the small town south of Milwaukee where he lives, even seeing one on the road is rare.

But in late June 2017, Smith poured $10,000 of savings into Tesla‚Äôs stock. He said it was the first time he‚Äôd ever invested in a company. That was just the start. Each paycheck, Smith, a¬†video¬†producer, would pay¬†his bills and then buy additional shares with the rest.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt make six figures, and I don‚Äôt know anything about puts and options,‚Äù Smith, 32, said¬†in a phone interview. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve just bought and held the entire time. I‚Äôve never sold a single share.‚Äù

Now Smith has joined the ranks of the ‚ÄúTeslanaires,‚Äù as some of the company‚Äôs investors call themselves,¬†with a holding that he says has ballooned to over $1 million, fueled by a rally of nearly 684% this year as of Thursday‚Äôs close. On Monday, Tesla will join the S&P 500 Index, a huge milestone for Elon Musk and the company he‚Äôs led as chief executive officer since 2008. It‚Äôs also a big day for the legions of retail investors who flocked to Tesla‚Äôs clean-energy mission and rode out numerous storms ‚Äî [production misses](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-01-03/tesla-falls-as-quarterly-deliveries-trail-analysts-estimates), [Elon‚Äôs tweets](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-05-01/tesla-shares-plunge-after-musk-says-stock-is-priced-too-high)¬†and even the [pandemic market crash](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-19/tesla-suspends-production-after-days-of-dueling-with-authorities?sref=mNrqRJq9).

Smith doesn‚Äôt have an exit strategy for his Tesla investment, though he‚Äôs begun thinking of finally building, or buying, his own house. Currently, he and his brother share a house that their grandfather built in Cudahy, Wisconsin. Monday ‚Äî the day Tesla joins the S&P ‚Äî is his 33rd birthday. He remains bullish on Tesla‚Äôs future, pointing to what he sees as the growth still to come.

‚ÄúThe next big thing is fourth-quarter deliveries, when Tesla could reach 500,000 deliveries for the year,‚Äù said Smith, who has a Cybertruck T-shirt and was able to [get a bottle of ‚ÄúTeslaquila‚Äù](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-12/musk-readies-teslaquila-after-april-fools-joke-left-bad-taste) before it sold out. ‚ÄúThen you have the new battery production in Texas and the [Cybertruck, which doesn‚Äôt even need a paint shop](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-24/musk-touts-146-000-cybertruck-orders-two-days-after-reveal).

Orsted (DNNGY, formerly DONG \[lol\]) is the largest offshore wind developer in the world with 16% market share. I think clean energy investments are already a good idea and I'm boomered into several clean energy ETFs already...QCLN, TAN, FAN, etc.

Why is Orsted going to be one of the best companies going forward?

\-There are 9 offshore wind farms going up off the Atlantic coast with estimated completion between 2023 and 2025; Orsted is developing 5 of them. When all the local news articles start coming out and idiots overwhelm the comments with talk of fish cancer, smart boomers are gonna invest.

\-New CEO Mads Nipper (Mads Lad) has already doubled their share price since he started in January. He also doubled the share price of his former company Grundfos and was the marketing director for LEGO. He's also an AC/DC fan (high voltage = high gains)

\-I think a Biden administration will increase the odds of these projects actually happening, but the company is majority-owned by the Danish government, and even if the US fucks up the shift to clean energy, Orsted will be successful elsewhere in the world. The Danes aren't stupid and have skin in the game. (Again, LEGO)

\-Orsted has a goal of net-zero carbon emission by 2025 and is likely one of the only companies who've made a pledge like this that can actually do it.

\-A downside you guys might not like is there's no options trading, but they account for something like 8% of FAN which does.

tl;dr: Mads Lad CEO, everyone living on the east coast will be hearing about this company in the next year or two, pumping DONG, LEGO is cool, kill the birds for their tendies üöÄüöÄüöÄ

[https://twitter.com/NipperMads](https://twitter.com/NipperMads)_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Cloud / Cyber Security - Splk Hello fellow Turds,

With the recent hack attack, boomers are now realizing importance of cyber security. It is a good time to place your bets on cloud/ cyber security providers. Now all of y'all are going to jump in tits up in pltr and obviously most of y'all will end up bag holders.

Popular candidate at least for silicon valley is Splunk- slpk. It is available at a bargain price right now. With a morning star fair value at 208, it is really a bargain for the cheap tards among you. 

Why so cheap you ask?

It fell after last earnings as some contracts which should have been in place 3rd quarter were postponed. These are already executed this quarter. So, outlook for next earnings looks good. Couple that with arriving stimulus/ vaccine and overall optimism on macro, y'all have a deal of life time.

Won't go into basics(you can read at any finance website or check analyst ratings) but company has good financials overall though might be over reinvesting. 

Now for the real wsbers: why can it achieve the retard strength and take you to tendieland? It doesn't have a very high market cap, initial price movement should come easier and the name of the company is Splunk ffs, it is meant to be a meme.

TLDR: Sell your house, buy SPLK_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Profiting off the hack of the decade - SUNBURST The Russians hacked everything and everyone in-the-know is shitting bricks.... [at least 40 high profile targets](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2020/12/17/cyberattacks-cybersecurity-solarwinds-fireeye/), secret meetings in congress,  [senators tweeting scary things](https://twitter.com/SenBlumenthal/status/1338972186535727105), [emergency cyber directives](https://cyber.dhs.gov/ed/21-01/), [demands to clean up, raise defenses and strike back](https://twitter.com/SenBlumenthal/status/1339585093170446342) are all leading to what is likely a bonanza of classified emergency funding authorizations across the US governments and top US and allied firms.  Shit is about to get real and as the details of this hack continue to be uncovered, money is gonna start flowing creating pandemic-level investing opportunities.. the question is.. where..

For that, it helps to understand the government's [process for responding to cybersecurity incidents](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-61r2.pdf).  To save you some reading, the most relevant parts are:  1) Detect the attack 2) Contain the damage 3) Eradicate the attacker 4) Recover from the attack and Prepare to prevent the next one.    Each phase of this process is going to favor particular players.  Here is who:

**Detect and Contain**

$FEYE - These guys detected what the CIA, NSA, DHS and everyone else missed.  FireEye/Mandiant are THE company you bring in when you have a major breach and were the ones to discover that the Russians backdoor'ed SolarWinds software.  Simply put, they are the best in the world at Detect and Contain.  Their phone is now ringing off the hook with panicked companies and government agencies willing to pay nearly anything for them to find the well hidden hackers on their network.

**Eradicate and Recover**

These attackers are in so deep and are so stealthy, that fully eradicating the them is going to mean completely rebuilding massive computer networks.  When NotPetya was unleashed on the world, recovery cost FedEx $400 million and Maersk $300 million.  We could see similar levels of spend at some impacted entities.

$LDOS, $GD, $NOC, $BAH - [These guys are top government contractors](https://www.cyberscoop.com/six-big-vendors-dominate-a-fragmented-federal-cybersecurity-market-numbers-show/) that have skills in cyber defense, the feds are comfortable with them and have contract vehicles to quickly start throwing money their way.  As someone who responds to cybershit for a living, its hard to overstate the amount of work it will take to rebuild computer networks hit by this attack.  The government will need an army of contractors to surge remediation personnel and it will take months.

**Revenge**

[Biden is already promising retaliation](https://www.axios.com/biden-fireeye-solarwinds-hack-retaliation-1d9eac1e-a454-43cf-9241-10c05b2d7586.html) and for anyone that paid attention during the Snowden revelations, we know that $BAH is balls deep in with the NSA on the offensive side the house.  Surging offensive capacity is going to be a good thing for the folks at Booze.

**Never Again**

Detecting and defending against cyber attacks like this is f'ing hard.  Defenders need advanced training and technology. Autist favorite $PLTR is going to be a favorite here.   Not only does the government love them, their platform has a proven track record of uncovering hard to detect attacks like [ghosnet](https://www.palantir.com/wp-assets/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/ImpactStudy_GhostNet.pdf) and Shadow Network.  Business is about to get really good at Palantir as government agencies like DOE, Treasury, DHS and others double-down on their software and services to put AI and ML detection technologies in place.  So... as y'all say  PLTR to the moon!!

TL/DR

This hack is a HUGE deal.  Congress is going to start dumping money.  That money is going to go to a handful of firms.  Buy $FEYE, $PLTR, $BAH, $LDOS and other government cybersecurity contractors._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ To celebrate TSLA's S&P inclusion, throwback to my post from June 1, 2019 + context and position.

So when I originally posted, half of WSB absolutely ridiculed me and the other half agreed. I got a couple guys PMing me they went all in after reading me (those guys were obviously autistic but I hope they did and held). 

Back then I had waited to jump in for several years. I had traded it a little but but never held. I wanted to own it so badly, I like the company and the meme. The stock was too high to go long, there was too much risk at that price. Then it finally dipped while having better fundamentals and after a trip to silicon valley I couldn't resist and bought in then averaged down.

Details of my purchases (all prices are pre-split):

---------------------------------------------

On 02/20/2019, bought 8 shares @$300

On 03/15/2019, bought 8 shares @$276

On 04/24/2019, bought 9 shares @$250  

On 05/17/2019, bought 5 shares @$218            

On 05/31/2019, bought 6 shares @$190 

---------------------------------------------

Total: 36 shares @avg $255.47 => $9,200 today worth $121,711

---------------------------------------------

Was planning to buy more, too bad it didn't dip more.

Why didn't I sell? Before that, I had bought 1,000 shares of AMD@$5 for long term hold, then pussied out at $13 (thinking it couldn't possibly go and stay higher) and sold. Now I don't try to time anything. 

---------------------------------------------

I remember how obviously retarded the market and analysts were back then on TSLA. It was so fucking obvious, even as a retard. Now it's retarded but in the other direction. This is fucking incredible. We knew analysts were useless but this is next level. Back then they were chasing the SP to the downside and now seeing them chase it to the upside over and over again and trying to backtrack the insanely high SP into their model is fucking hilarious.

"ArcelorMittal (NYSE:MT) reportedly has raised its Europe-wide hot-rolled coil and hot-dip galvanized coil offers to ‚Ç¨700/ton and ‚Ç¨800/ton, respectively, for April-May deliveries. The price hike continues the current rally in the European steel market, where HRC prices are now at a nine-year high, according to S&P Global Platts. The price increase marks ArcelorMittal's third in less than a month, amounting to a cumulative ‚Ç¨150/ton jump; the company announced it was targeting ‚Ç¨650/ton for European HRC on Dec. 4, helping propel the market higher. ArcelorMittal's recent price increases have been far more successful than those tabled over 2019, as buyers negotiating 2021 prices have been left with little room to maneuver, given the surging spot market and higher contract settlements with general industry participants."

I'll keep this short... We all know that $PFE shit the bed in our portfolios on vaccine news & that's fine because I have a new play for us. $WBA. Now I know what you're thinking, total boomer stock I know i know... But with low IV & great news this could be a real bag! 3 million vaccines already ready to be delivered by $WBA. 

NEWS THIS AM: Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. (WBA) said Friday it has begun administering Pfizer Inc.'s (PFE) and BioNTech SE's (BNTX) COVID-19 vaccine to residents and staff at long-term care facilities, starting with Connecticut and Ohio. Starting Dec. 21, the drug store chain and health care services company said its pharmacy team members will provide vaccinations at about 800 long-term care facilities across 12 states... continue DD below....

Get on before the rocket leaves the station, this boomer stock will GO!!

For real though, picking stock's with super high IV and all the hype, will slowly bleed your portfolio if you lose even the slightest momentum. Grab something BEFORE the FOMO kicks in... 

**TLDR or whatever**: Buy shares/contracts $WBA - Starting out with distributing vaccines to over 3 million people at over 35,000 long term care facilities! Only UP FROM HERE!!! 

**Positions:** 110x 1/15 50c & 2,000 shares._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ TSLA strategy Index funds report their holdings daily.. 
 None of the index funds have reported holding any shares of TSLA yet. It looks like every fund is planning to buy at the closing cross today so they track the S&P benchmark as close as possible. This means they want to get in at the closing price, or at least as close as possible. They don't care what the share price actually is since they just need to track the S&P and buy a fixed dollar amount of TSLA shares.

It looks like there will be a huge liquidity imbalance with funds trying to buy 120M shares (15% of the free float) in <5 minutes right at market close.

So my strategy is to set "Limit on Close" orders with a very large (+100%) asking price. The funds either pick up my shares and track the index accurately, or they don't and their orders go unfilled at which point we repeat this again at Monday's open cross where they will be panicking even more to get shares.

TLDR: buy shares this morning. Set very high limit on close orders. Sit back and watch the shit show while you pound the index fund's girlfriends in the back of your new mansion.

Edit: unlike options the downside is pretty limited since this isn't a leveraged trade and there will be a huge liquidity with fund buyers lined up all over the place._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Palantir accumulation https://imgur.com/gallery/VhaUGUX

That above is the technical analysis. The chart looks like a https://imgur.com/gallery/qhF0QPl
So what does the chart say: 
1) palantir is accumulating, that means is gonna pump soon ( just look at the volume and the Fibonacci https://www.tradingview.com/x/tliEKRi1/ chart).The target üéØ that we get from the Fibonacci retracement and the pattern shown in second Imgur link is an incredible good sign for the 40$ palantir ultimate target. The trading view link shows different supports and resistance that we need to break in order to reach those fourties 
First resistance at 29, then 31.24 and ultimately 33.50 if this last resistance breaks there will be nothing holding palantir from going to 40$.

2) Credit suisse downgraded palantir today, obvious manipulation since their option puts expire today. Care about the gap in the tradingview chart at 23,40 / 23,50 ( possibile buying opportunity ) and the first support at 25( another buying opportunity).

3) Buy palantir üöÄüöÄ

FedEx crushed earnings but still dropped as investors looked for guidance. What to expect from Nike after the close? Let‚Äôs talk about this and other stock market news**

**\~Very Long Post\~**

Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let‚Äôs start with the recap of yesterday, as we saw another great day for the stock market with the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/vQZKh9Y) leading the way up 0.84%, the broad market [SP500](https://ibb.co/r2K5TXj) also up 0.58% and the [Dow Industrial](https://ibb.co/j5MYhLG) up almost half a percent, as all 3 big indexes closed at new a record high. We also saw de [VIX](https://ibb.co/P6dnhX7) dropping below 22, as it dropped 2.5%.

Almost 2/3 of the [companies](https://ibb.co/SsV2KG6) were advancing yesterday with over 200 new highs on average volume, as 9 of the 11 [sectors](https://ibb.co/yhc1562) in the SP500 were in the green with only energy and communications losing ground for the day, as small and mid-caps outperformed [yesterday](https://ibb.co/g7zCvs9) while large-caps were flat for the day.

You can see in this [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/bdFGb96) that yesterday was a good day for most of the stock market, while only a couple of companies lost significant ground like Boeing, AT&T and Google, while Tesla rose again ahead of the SP500 inclusion.

Important economic data also came in, as initial jobless [claims](https://ibb.co/dJQv6d0) rose even more from the previous week by more than 20k, while the continuing jobless claims fell to 5.5M, lower than expected and the last week number. I think it is possible we can see the initial claims jump to over 900K in the next weeks as the economy feels more pressure from the rising cases numbers and more restrictions.

Meanwhile, we also got the December Kansas City FED [INDEX](https://ibb.co/L6zW9Zp) reading, that came in at +14, above the estimates and the numbers from November. But this is still more than 10 points down from last year‚Äôs reading, while the Philly Fed [outlook](https://ibb.co/LJwCCpT) came in worse than expected and last month‚Äôs reading.

We also got numbers from November housing [starts](https://ibb.co/jvcyWyV), as this came in with a more than 1% increase month over month, bigger than expected, as building permits also jumped more than 6% to over 1.6M.

While [TODAY](https://ibb.co/2hMmxy3) there is not a lot of important economic data that will come in, as the outlook for the economy remains very uncertain at the moment, as the economy needs to survive until enough people get the shot so we can reach herd immunity, which will allow business to come back again, as restrictions will go away.

We also saw Moderna receive the [FDA](https://ibb.co/fqC4Qys) Ad Com endorse the vaccine with a 20 to 0 vote and 1 abstention.

So, today is a big day, today is quadruple witching day and also the last day that Tesla is not included in the SP500. It‚Äôs [expected](https://ibb.co/ZVQ9MRR) that there will be over $80B worth of shares trading hands today, as they will become the most valuable company ever to enter the main index on Wall Street. This will also force index-tracking funds and money managers to buy Tesla shares to correctly reflect the index, while also selling positions in other companies that are part of the SP, as Tesla will account for over 1% of the index starting Monday.

Meanwhile, the company also just received an [upgrade](https://ibb.co/mHnpZHb) on its crediting rating from S&P Global ratings as they noted that Tesla‚Äôs net debt is essentially zero based on key metric, DEBT to EBITDA.

So, expect some massive volume to be traded in Tesla in the final minutes before the close today, Tesla is already the most traded [stock](https://ibb.co/1XZ58xj) on Wall Street and has surged more than 50% since the SP news came out. I think either outcome is possible as we can see either the stock heading to new highs or see a decent correction if bears prevail. Just watch out for the closing of the session today.

This is will be key moment for the stock market, with the FED also coming out today with the latest round of stress [tests](https://ibb.co/26CZDCh) for the banks. I don‚Äôt expect any surprises coming from here, as they were found to be able to weather big capital losses last time around in the summer.

In some other stock market news, [FedEx](https://ibb.co/ZVmggDG) delivered great earnings results, delivering a beat of more than 80 cents on EPS, while it also saw a bigger increase in revenue than expected, with a more than $1B beat and the operating margin coming in pretty much as expected.

The net income and earnings per share more than [doubled](https://ibb.co/vV7FTbv) since last year after rate hikes and spiking volume from e-commerce shipments, as the company has seen a boom alongside the e-commerce growth. But this was not enough to help the stock, as it dropped 3% in after-hours, as the lack of a formal guidance kind of disappointed investors, as they did not offer an improved [outlook](https://ibb.co/C1LFVDf) for FY2021 and the capital spending is still expected to surpass $5B.

While today we also get [Nike](https://ibb.co/s15BfJH) earnings after the close, as the company is expected to have a lower EPS than last year, but to increase the revenues by more than 1%. Nike is a great company and the world largest sportswear company, and I expect them to deliver on these expectations as its digital strategy is offsetting much of the lost retail sales after massive investments in technology that are transforming its business.

Some expected [news](https://ibb.co/qMs6xv5) also came in from Coca-Cola as they will cut more than 1K jobs in the US and more than 2K worldwide. This is another move that is looking to improve the efficiency of the company, as they have been hit alongside the restaurant business.

While Doordash fell [yesterday](https://ibb.co/LCdsSN1), after the short sellers from citron research called it the most ridiculous IPO of the year, giving the company a Price Target of $40. I usually don‚Äôt agree with such drops after short sellers make some statements or publish something, this is a common-used tactic by them, they get into a stock and publish a report that sees the stock plunge as the make money. But I kind of have to agree with them on this one, the valuation for Doordash is just ridiculous, but I don‚Äôt see it going down that much‚Ä¶

In comparison, investors seem to like [ABNB](https://ibb.co/F47f56X) somewhat more than DASH, as AirBNB traded higher, but still has a ridiculous valuation, bigger the BP, FedEx or even Deere, despite negative margins with more competition and new lawsuits from different cities in the world.

(This is listed in UK so if you do not have access to the UK market feel free to skip reading)

KAZ Minerals is currently undergoing a takeover offer from a large shareholder (who is also a Kazakhstani oligarch) and the CEO (who is also the oligarch's friend). The takeover offer stands at 6.40 GBP per share which materially undervalues the firm given the recent strong run in copper prices. Several shareholders expressed opposition to the deal with undervaluation the main reason for opposition.

The Kazakhstani oligarch and CEO want to take the firm private at a bargain price ahead of a major bull run in copper and a decarbonization cycle which will support the metal. Throughout 2019 and 2020, scandals relating to soviet and Kazakhstani oligarchs, suspected money laundering schemes of corrupted officials have led to significantly increasing distrust from UK/western authorities, I believe this could support any legal battles and opposition.

Stock currently trades at 6.50 GBP (downside limited to 6.40 GBP because of the offer, whereas the potential upside could be between 20% - 25%) and presents approximately 15:1 reward-risk ratio. This is based on a chart-overlay with COPX (copper miners ETF), which tightly correlates with KAZ Minerals.

Since 2017, Palantir has partnered with Scuderia Ferrari to integrate and analyze performance data in order to make faster, more data-driven decisions.
Throughout its lifetime, a vehicle generates a massive amount of data. From initial design to production and assembly, through marketing and sales, and eventually in use on the road, this data can provide valuable insight into quality, safety, and performance. But processing and integrating vehicle data takes time and effort that could otherwise be spent diagnosing complex problems.

SKYWISE
Skywise connects the aviation value chain in a secure ecosystem that‚Äôs transforming how the industry uses data.
Now, airlines can use massive-scale sensor data, maintenance systems, aircraft schedules, passenger bookings, and more in one environment. On top of this data asset, Skywise offers a diverse analytical suite for operators to make sense of that data in both code-free and code-based environments.

CYBER
With the uptick in high-profile data breaches, organizations with large networks are working hard to guard against advanced intruders who identify and exploit complex vulnerabilities on the most important systems. But often, a tunnel vision focus on sophisticated attacks distract organizations from more basic problems, like stale passwords or machines that haven't been patched against months-old vulnerabilities, that leave them just as vulnerable to attack.

FINANCIAL COMPLIANCE 
Financial institutions with complex portfolios and high volumes of trades and transactions are often buried under petabytes of data, incompatible systems, and complicated customer landscapes. As this data grows in size and complexity, so does the regulatory landscape, and traditional tools can't keep.

INSURANCE
Key players in insurance are using Palantir Foundry to optimize every stage of the value chain: from underwriting and pricing through to policy administration, claims handling, risk management, and reserving.

LAW ENFORCEMENT 
For federal and local law enforcement agencies, Palantir Law Enforcement equips officers and agents with the tools they need to easily analyze intelligence, securely collaborate on investigations, manage cases, produce reports, and respond to crime as it happens.

MANUFACTURING
The most critical challenges facing manufacturers throughout the value chain are, fundamentally, data challenges. Supply chain, procurement, quality control, efficiency, rapid troubleshooting, and demand forecasting depend on an accurate and up-to-date data landscape

PHARMA
Pharmaceutical companies need an accurate, detailed picture of patient experience and outcomes in both clinical trials and the real world to develop and deliver effective drugs. However, analyzing real-world data for differentiated biomedical insight requires dealing with tremendous scale and complexity, as well as potential privacy concerns. Claims data, for example, is on the order of billions of rows, and genomics data can contain thousands of features per patient.

CASE MANAGEMENT
Palantir Case Management provides a flexible solution for collaborative business process management. Users manage, investigate, and track cases without leaving the Palantir Gotham investigative platform, as well as add new information through simple data entry forms and export follow-on reports in configurable templates. With the full universe of data available in a unified environment, users rapidly build out and resolve case-based workflows.

DEFENSE
From strategy to operations to tactics, from reachback facilities to the tactical edge of the battlefield, Palantir Defense gives the warfighter immediate access to the latest critical information, removing the technical barriers to better data-driven decision making.

FACILITATE GDPR COMPLIANCE WITH PALANTIR FOUNDRY
Palantir Foundry provides the secure and accountable infrastructure that organizations need to maximize the value of their data while making sure that it's processed in accordance with the rules, regulations, and norms that govern data privacy

INTELLIGENCE
Palantir empowers intelligence agencies to securely derive actionable insights from sensitive data and achieve their most challenging operational objectives

LEGAL INTELLIGENCE
For legal professionals building complex cases, Palantir Legal Intelligence enables the discovery of patterns of behavior and links between key actors that lie hidden in vast amounts of structured and unstructured dataLawyers handle massive volumes of data from many sources. Many types of data that lawyers routinely encounter complicate traditional research methods.

MERGERS & ACQUISITIONS
Mergers and acquisitions fundamentally change companies, their strategies, and their technology landscapes. Whether it's a one-time transaction or part of a broader M&A strategy, acquiring companies end up with fragmented systems that inhibit visibility into their newly unified organization's data. At the most critical juncture since their founding, companies are forced to prioritize systems decisions over business ones.

SALES AND REVENUE
Across industries, the competitive landscape changes quickly and organizations need to adapt faster than ever before. Delivering the right products and services requires granular insight into changes in customer behavior and dynamic ways to test and deploy new sales strategies.

Here's an introduction to the next 10x to add to your portfolio. Let's get started. 

**^(Disclaimer)**^(: I work in healthcare and not in mining. I've also been a TECK investor since 2016.) 

**Background**: 

$TECK - Teck Resources is a large Canadian miner that focuses in Copper, Zinc, Coking Coal, and Bitumen (Asphalt) mining. It's Canada's 20th largest company (as of 2019) and it's largest miner (Barrick Gold @ #2). It has an interesting history - in 2008, they nearly went bankrupt and were bailed out by Chinese investors (they bought 17% of the company), and was further reiterated by electing a Chinese Official to it's board of directors in 2016. 

The easiest way to explain TECK is that it's a large Canadian miner that has close ties with China. 

**Fundamentals**: 

I've listed to TECK's earnings calls and read their quarterly reports so you don't have to. However, it's best to start with TECK's history. Here's a summary of their scale: 

&#x200B;

[2015-2019 Production by Commodity ](https://preview.redd.it/0782nlnseu561.png?width=810&format=png&auto=webp&s=ae38ebf5c8083015800ff12d49ffc8a759927245)

All you ESG (Environmental, social and corporate governance) know that no one likes to touch coal (which is massively undervalued btw - coking coal, not thermal coal - there's a difference), but let's ignore that bit for a minute. TECK was the top mining company in the DJOW Sustainability index for 2019, and on the list for 10 straight years. 

First thing to call out - TECK's output is stable - it hasn't really changed an any area except Bitumen (Asphalt) in the past 5 years. 

Here's TECK's 2020 H2 numbers (let's forget Q1/2): 

&#x200B;

[H2 Guidance from October 26](https://preview.redd.it/5hvrnguaju561.png?width=627&format=png&auto=webp&s=ad4a6cb53a346bbfcf656d005d185b725188730f)

TECK's production is largely stable across quarters, so what does this insight show us: 

* Steelmaking coal will be lower YoY
   * This was expected as they shutdown a coal mine for 5 months. They also are expecting Union protests at a coal terminal (not something they own). 
* Copper is inline with expectations 
* Zinc is above expectations
* Bitumen is too new to establish a trend/expectations, but overall seems low

Let's now compare TECK's commodity expectations against current future prices: 

* Steelmaking coal: 
   * Expected Cost of Sales: $67/ton - due to reduced mining output and sales and declining to $60/ton by December. Additionally, transportation is about $40/ton for your railcar. 
      * Expect transportation costs to be on the higher end or higher. Everyone is shipping right now, and rail/freight is super expensive. 
   * Met coal is very hard to find real-time prices on, but typically is about $150/ton (fell to $100/ton in Q1-2). If you have a Bloomberg Terminal, please share real-time prices with us plebeians. 
      * Currently I expect met coal to be trading about $140/ton. Coal prices are [rapidly rising](https://tradingeconomics.com/commodity/coal) after all time lows from Covid. 
   * [News](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/11/23/2131382/0/en/Teck-Provides-Steelmaking-Coal-Market-Update.html) on China/Teck coal relations - Teck maintains Q4 coal volume of 5.8-6.2m/tons, but will ship 20% to China due to increased demand 
      * Read the article - China is willing to pay Teck $30-35/ton over Australian spot. Recent shipments in November were $160-165/ton, which is a huge premium, and likely only increased in recent weeks. They've also sold 7.5m tons (25% annual production) at $50 over Australian spot for 2021. China is eating steel, and Teck is feeding the fire. 
   * Coal production expectations were higher for Q4 due to better ore grade, but TECK didn't provide numbers for increased expectations. We might see higher than 6.2m tons on rising prices. 
   * Coal was clubbed like a baby seal in Q1-2 because most steel plants world-wide were shutdown. If you read this thread, you know that Steel is reaching record high prices due to limited supply from these plant shutdowns. It would be prudent of you to invest in met coal, which is used in blast furnaces in steel production. Prices are rapidly rising and coal companies are wildly undervalued. 
      * Check out Arch Resources for a large US coal company play. 
   * TECK noted in Q3 report that coal orders were below COVID levels, but with current prices and confirmation on trading prices, we should see increased revs on coal for Q4. 
      * TECK noted that companies were not selling coal as it would be at a huge loss, so there was significant quantity in queue at port. However, they also noted that Australia didn't have any in port, so it should be non-Australiana coal miner taking advantage of recent coal price increases. 
      * They also note that there's significant inventory of coking coal in China, so we shouldn't expect this to be a big driver for earnings.
      * FWIW - China is mostly buying coal from Mongolia at prices $100 over spot. Go look on twitter for proof. 
      * TECK also acknowledges that they can meet increased demand from China if needed for Coal. However, they've closed mines over the past year, which decreases their ability to scale. 
* Copper: 
   * Expected cost of sales - $1.55/pound on the high end. Trading at $3.5+/pound is a huge margin. Look for increases in copper to make this soar. 
   * Copper prices were $3.02/pound on Oct 26 and are at $3.61/pound today. That's a 19% increase in pricing for you mathematicians. 
   * QB2 is going to be a huge copper mine that comes operational in 2022. Copper prices continuing to increase is super bullish for TECK to take advantage of higher copper prices. 
      * Most of TECK's losses are going into capital expenditures for a huge copper mine opening in 2022. Copper demand will increase 100% by 2030 per BHP (world's largest copper producer), so this is super bullish. Buy into mines opening soon. 
      * TECK trades almost 50% of copper to China. This isn't an anomaly. 
* Zinc: 
   * Zinc is bearish for TECK - their mine has decreasing volume YoY each quarter. It's a dying mine, but still super profitable. 
   * Zinc is about $.60/pound for cost for sales. 
   * Zinc shipments to China rose by 40%. China zinc production decreased, which led them to reach out to TECK. 
   * Zinc is trading at 21% increase compared to prices at earnings. 
   * Zinc is more complicated as there is different prices depending on the grade. 
   * Mining volume should increase in Q4 to match 2019 output. Mining output in Q4 2019 was about double. 

**Outlook**: 

Commodities are entering a multi-year bull market, and TECK is a great investment. As a trader though, you are looking for a short-term profit rather than a long term hold. Here's a few things to help: 

* Copper should consolidate before moving towards $4/pound. That pullback is your opportunity to buy the dip. 
* Canadian Banks primarily cover $TECK and have Price Estimates between $23-27. My personal price target with copper holding $3.6/pound is $30 by March. TECK is low market cap ($10b right now). It booms and busts with commodity changes. $TECK at usual 2010-2020 prices would be about $12b rev/annually, but that'll change with current prices. 
* TECK acknowledges there is consolidation in the sector. How cool is that? 
* Q3 call focused on coal and water treatment. It didn't focus on Copper and Zinc, which are skyrocketing. Analysts were wanting to assess TECK's weaknesses, and confirmed that there's a huge buying opportunity here. 
* Bitumen (asphalt) was a loss on $TECK's books in Q3. Bitumen is up 12% on the month, but it is a new commodity and hard to evaluate. 
* Disclaimer: Miners estimate their ore output. When they announce earnings, it will change. 
* TECK will have about $500m in capital expenditures in Q4. That's bullish for long term, but maybe hurtful in short term. 
* Covid has minimal impact and is easy tax write-off. 
* TECK has plenty of debt revolvers to finance mines. 
* Copper will go to $4 with expectations of EVs and Clean energy <3

**Napkin Math**: 

* $TECK revs are expected at $2.8b CAD. We should well exceed that. 
   * 6m tons of coal @ $150 = $900m - this is a super bullish number. If at $130, then we get $780m. 
      * Cost is $100/ton. That's $30-50/ton of profit. or $180-300m in profit. 
   * Let's expect a $2/pound profit on copper. That's a $600m profit on copper. 
   * Let's expect $1.20/pound profit on Zinc. That's $565m profit on zinc, with considerable upside if volume increases

They've been completely open and cooperative with the SEC and Cayman court systems and have righted the ship. The 180 million penalty, they can deduct future law suits from.

"

1. The Company has come to an agreement with the SEC, which is embodied in the consent and the draft final judgment dated 16 December 2020 (see Appendix III). Under the terms of the agreement, the Company, without admitting or denying the allegations of the SEC, consented to the entry of an order requiring the Company to pay a civil penalty in the amount of US$180M. The civil penalty is to be offset by the dollar value of any cash payments made by the Company to CBs and SHs pursuant to schemes of arrangement sanctioned by the Cayman Court, if such payments are made within 42 months subject to extensions granted by the SEC staff and provided the final distribution plan is not reasonably objectionable to SEC staff."

The court audit showed 750 million approx in cash. They are reportedly churning a profit now per those court filings and sitting a less than a billion market cap.

"

1. As previously mentioned, the Company implemented various improvement measures to refine and optimise its store portfolio and pricing and as a result of these efforts, the Company achieved positive store level profit1 at the aggregate level for the first time in August 2020. Additionally, more than 60% of the approximately 3,898 self-operated stores were profitable on store level1 in November 2020."

Canoo üöÄüöÄüöÄ _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Using Open Interest to determine stock sentiment I've been doing some research into using open interest to determine support/resistance levels and bullish/bearish sentiment. There's a lot of contradicting research out there depending on how you're preserving the OI (from buyers side or sellers side). Have drawn the following conclusions so far, would be good to get your thoughts on them:

**Large OI for OTM Call (Bearish)**

* Can be resistance as sellers would want to keep the price below strike. 
* Closer the underlying gets to buyers strike, they are more likely to close out to take profits. 
* OTM Call OI can be perceived as open sellers and act as resistance.

**Large OI for OTM Put (Bullish)**

* Can be support as buyers would want to keep the price above strike. 
* Closer the underlying gets to buyers strike, they are more likely to close out to take profits. 
* OTM Put OI can be perceived as open sellers and act as support.

**Large OI for ITM Call (Bullish)**

* Sellers of this contract could be holding as part of a call debit spread
* Buyers will be holding to see how far it can go üöÄ so this would offer support. 
* So they both offer a level of support.

**Large OI for ITM Put (Bearish)**

* Sellers of this contract could be holding as part of a put debit spread 
* Buyers will be holding to see if it can go to rock bottom
* Both would offer a level of resistance.

These are just my thoughts looking from both the buyers and sellers perspective, open to hear other thoughts on support/resistance using OI._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Load up on puts ASAP _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Can you tell when I started fucking around with options? _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Palantir FD's Palantir's 3 main products are Foundry, Apollo, and Gotham.

That's right, the weekend squad arrived early. So get your passports and grab your nuts because this bitch is gonna be flying. 

Are you in MT? What convinced you? Was it the supply shortage? The increasing demand? The raising of tonnage prices? The fucking awesome quarterly improvements? Don't lie, I know you saw some meme and that was all it took. So peep this. Where the fuck is MT located? Fucking Luxemburg! Have you even been to Luxemburg? No! Neither have I. Who the fuck goes to Luxemburg? But I know Luxemburg is a small-ass land locked country about half the size of a Texas county. How the fuck do they have this steel industry!? They don't! See, if you cock-yodeling ballsack-ticklers did your own DD, you'd know MT has facilities on every continent. You know what that means? They can serve every fucking market. If the Rona gets one, fuck it, they're still going in the others. It also means production never stops! I don't care if you're a Flyover-Country Redneck or an Ethiopian Cheetah Chaser, there is an MT facility near you. 

But I'm not here to pump MT (I mean, it wouldn't hurt me if I were...buy moar MT). No, I'm here for you dick whistlers, and to make you think big picture shit. I wish the retarded ass mods would let me tell you about the specific companies I'm trying to tell you about, but since they're below $1bn market cap, I'll get scolded by the bots.  So, do your own fucking DD and figure it out, but something about GOLDEN OCEANS that are made of SALTwater might be a good place to start. 

So here's the deal, I want you to think macro for a second. Did you know there is a world beyond your own dicks? Incredible, I know, who the fuck wants to spend time there? But it's true! There's all sorts of shit out there; cows, ships, mountains. Shit's crazy man. So think for a moment. How does a company like MT get it's shit? If you're making steel, you're going to need lots of coal and iron, right? I bet they don't get that shit from fucking Luxemburg. So there's your first macro thought to ponder regarding companies I can't tell you about. Who mines the iron and coal for the steel industry? Who does that black lung shit for MT? Here's your second thought to ponder: How the fuck does it get to the fucking steel plant? Barges and big ass ships! Whose got those? Well, do your own DD, this is a learning experience, ok? Also, can we please adjust the banned ticker market cap? Then ask yourself, "who the fuck services/supplies the mines and ships that are going to be sending me tendies through MT?"  

Look, if you jumped into MT because you recognize the metals market is bullish af right now, why not consider investing in the whole chain? Do your own DD, that's good advice in general, but figure out who else is printing tendies off this boom. This isn't tech, don't expect anything meaningful before Summer, but if you ever felt like being Cornelius Vanderbilt, buy the whole damn chain.  Do yo chain hang low?

AI is upending existing industries

Upstart is one of the first businesses to apply AI to the multi-trillion dollar credit industry. Upstart goes beyond the FICO score, using non-conventional variables at scale to provide superior loan performance and improve consumers' access to credit.

**Why Buy?**

Upstart's model is significantly more accurate than traditional lending models; allowing them to approve more applicants at lower loss rates.

They have 75% fewer defaults at the same approval rate as boomer lenders. Additionally, they have 173% **more approvals at the same loss rate**. And guess what? They approve loans almost instantaneously (69% of the loans in Q4 2019), which means no need for underwriters needing to approve every loan.

Oh yeah and I forgot to mention that they‚Äôre founder was the president of enterprise at Google, maybe you‚Äôve heard of it.

Hey, I'm the guy that brought you the CRM play the other day before it started rising. ([https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kda0bd/crm\_getting\_ready\_to\_head\_to\_tendie\_town/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kda0bd/crm_getting_ready_to_head_to_tendie_town/))

I'm here today with another play before it really gets going. We all had EV run #1, but what about EV run #2?

I know most of you can't read, so here are pictures instead. Look at these charts that are all primed to start a run.

My Positions: RIDE, RIDEW, NKLA, & NIO Jan 15 $45C_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ [Discussion] With the Steel Index at almost ATH values, why is MT (and others) not moving at the same rate? I've seen this asked several times across multiple threads so I figure it'd be good to create a thread just for this question. 

I'm specifically referring to this thread:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kf77ok/mt\_dd\_steel\_prices\_up\_to\_11year\_high/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kf77ok/mt_dd_steel_prices_up_to_11year_high/)

Why are MT and other iron-ore mining companies not following the Steel index as closely as they have in the past? Is it because the demand for COVID is low and we are expecting some indication that demand has increased in early 2021? 

These might be dumb questions but I can't find the answer anywhere._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Got killed on my last post, don't blame me for Vanguard's terrible interface!! Been a good 45 days, my gain plus my positions - constantly adding TSLA, PSTH, PLTR, selling covered calls, thanks for the DD! _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Please welcome our newest member to the fam...SKLZ (Mobile Esports Platform) _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $NRZ increases dividend 33% I've been following NRZ for years and always benefited from their huge dividends. Pre covid they were giving out $0.50 dividends on a stock that cost under 20 bucks. Right when covid hit they dropped their divided from 50 cents to 5 cents! Ridiculous right? Well as you could guess, the share price plummeted. This was totally out of character for them and their earnings weren't even that effected by covid. This is a real estate and financial services company. My neighbor is a residential loan officer and his company was just bought out by NRZ! They took an opportunity to retain some profit and expand their business, all while crying covid. Those fuckers... But what to do when you hear all this? I of course kept buying more shares. I'm sitting on almost a thousand atm. They have steadily increased their dividend each quarter from .05 to .10 to .15 and now to .20 announced dec 16th. Stock prices have historically risen proportionally and we're probably two or three quarters away from ath and as long as dividends rise each quarter. This is a slow play but you can benefit from high yields and rising prices. No brainier for an artist like myself hedging some riskier bets._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ BXMT about to break out. Been on the rise since Soros bought in. Just out the money options dirt cheap still. - George the friendly Soros bought in about 2 months ago and this thing has been rising ever since

- It's hitting a price level that has a lot of empty space above it, little resistance should leap.
