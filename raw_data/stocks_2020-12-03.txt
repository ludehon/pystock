Thanks_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Question about Dividend Calculations This may seem like a dumb question, but I’m fairly new to investing and would really appreciate a bit of help. I own 21.885399 shares of Exxon (XOM). I purchased the shares in March at an average cost of $41.66 per share, with the stock currently trading at $40.23 per share. The stock also has a dividend yield of 9.04%. My quarterly dividend payout (determined on 11/11 when the stock was at $36.48 per share) is $19.04. I’ve assumed that dividends are calculated by multiplying the share price and the dividend yield (for example, $40.23 x 0.0904 = $3.64/share, much less than the current $0.87 per share that was paid out). I’m thinking that the dividend yield is calculated annually, then divided by 4 for quarterly payouts. Is this correct? Or am I overlooking something simple while trying to figure out what my dividend payouts should be?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ For Those Who Don't Understand the Inevitable Short Squeeze with GME First, what is a short?

The first concept to understand is you **sell** to **open**, and **buy** to **close**.

Your brokerage will lend you x amount of shares and sell them on your behalf on the market. That you is **selling** to **open** the short position.

When you cover your position you **buy** to **close** the position.   
Let's say you short GME at $15.80 for 1000 shares and the price drops to $12. You would borrow 1000 shares from your broker that are sold on the market at $15.80, you decide to close your position at $12 where you would then buy those 1000 shares at $12/share and give them back to the broker. You would profit $3.80/share so $3800.

But what if the price goes up? Well, you have **cover** that position. So if you short GME at $15.80 and it goes up to $16.20 you are already in the hole $0.40/share. 

**Key Point:** Shorting happens on a **margin** account. That means, it's not actually your money either. It's the brokerages. If you are losing enough money you will go into what is called a **house call** which essentially will force you to cover your position. 

Moral of the story, if you drive the price up, you will force short positions to either cover or double down.   
The case of GME is extremely interesting because there is over 100% short interest, meaning there are more shorts than actual volume.

THIS is what causes a short squeeze. This is also why you can't expect it to happen over night.

Short Position A might be Bob from Kentucky who has a $350,000 margin account and he shorted at 15.80, once it gets to 16.50 we wants out because he's already losing so much and it's not worth the risk.

Short Position B might be Bank of A lot of Power who has a $4BN margin account and can wait years for it to fail, so they have no need to cover their positions unless it's looking really bad long term. (Like if this Cohen thing happens)

As shorts cover their positions, they are forced to buy at a higher price than they shorted, driving the stock price up. This will lead to more short positions covering driving the price up some more, leading to more short positions doing the same. All the way up to the whales who have massive short positions. 

GME has over 100% short interest, has formed a cup and handle, and the potential Cohen takeover is right around the corner. A squeeze will happen.

Hope this helps!

EDIT:

Regarding GME specifically. The earnings call on 12/8 has two possible outcomes.

1. Cohens letters are addressed and either GME begins moving forward and meets his demands or he gets a controlling position in the company.

2. Cohens letters are ignored.

If case 2 happens there are two possible outcomes.

1. Cohen initiates a hostile takeover
2. Cohen gives up the fight and sells his shares (this is the risk of this play, every other circumstance leads to a squeeze, this one leads to the shorts winning and GME heading for the toilet, however this is unlikely, it’s not like GME wants to go out of business, so it’s very unlikely Cohen and his public letters are ignored)_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Thoughts about API-Agora Hi people.

It’s my impression there are 2 types of stock, 1) that you just hope grows, 2) that you hope grows some, but tends to grow less, but pays dividends. When a company goes public it sells some shares and keeps some. You and I can buy the latter. Unless the stock is a dividend paying stock, the only real asset we gain is the right to later sell our stock to someone else for any price we can agree to. If we buy into Best Company Ever, and if it’s not a dividend stock, in a way the price of the stock is still completely determined by public perception or hype. Actual value of the company almost doesn’t even matter. If people get fired up by Worst Company Ever, it’s prices will go higher than Best Company’s. In general companies prefer their stock prices go up, because the stock they originally kept and didn’t sell increases in value, giving them a way to reward themselves or generate capital if desired. The only other way stock has a certain value is that if a high enough percentage of it is owned it gives influence or even control about how a company is run, but that’s almost totally irrelevant for all but the super wealthy.

* Ultra-cold chain requires special refrigerators and dry ice for shipping, both out of the norm for the distribution of vaccines.
* It expects to ship 50M doses globally by the end of the month compared to its original plan of 100M. It still expects to ship more than 1B doses in 2021. Shipments will be made from final assembly and distribution centers in Kalamazoo, MI and Puurs, Belgium.
* Related ticker: BioNTech (BNTX -2.2%)

Pfizer Inc. expects to ship half of the Covid-19 vaccines it originally planned for this year because of supply-chain problems, but still expects to roll out more than a billion doses in 2021.“Scaling up the raw material supply chain took longer than expected,” a company spokeswoman said. “And it’s important to highlight that the outcome of the clinical trial was somewhat later than the initial projection.”

## Pfizer and Germany-based partner BioNTech SE had hoped to roll out 100 million vaccines world-wide by the end of this year, a plan that has now been reduced to 50 million. The U.K. on Wednesday granted emergency-use authorization for the vaccine, becoming the first Western country to start administering doses.

The two-shot vaccine also is being reviewed by the Food and Drug Administration in the U.S., where a similar authorization could come later this month and a rollout before the end of the year. The U.S. regulator also is considering a vaccine developed by Cambridge, Mass.-based [Moderna Inc.](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/MRNA) that could begin shipping before Christmas.The doses are among an array of vaccines that have been developed this year as the coronavirus pandemic has raged across much of the world. Authorities estimate nearly 1.5 million people world-wide have died from the virus, including 273,836 in the U.S. as of Dec. 2.“We were late,” said a person directly involved in the development of the Pfizer vaccine. “Some early batches of the raw materials failed to meet the standards. We fixed it, but ran out of time to meet this year’s projected shipments.”Pfizer sources its raw materials from providers in the U.S. and Europe. Scaling up production of these components proved challenging last month as the company awaited the results of its trials, which came in to be 95% effective and well-tolerated in a 44,000-subject trial.Pfizer wouldn’t say where shortfalls over ingredients arose as it ramped up production. Vaccines typically contain materials from suppliers that can include antivirus agents, antiseptic liquids, sterile water and elements of the DNA of the virus itself that won’t cause serious symptoms but trigger the immune system to make antibodies.In a typical vaccination campaign, pharmaceutical companies would wait until their product is approved before buying raw materials, establishing manufacturing lines and setting up supply chains to ship a vaccine. Pfizer has never manufactured a vaccine with technology that uses mRNA, the molecular couriers that carry genetic instructions to cells in the human body, so it has had to scale up production capacity even as research was still under way.“For this one, everything happened simultaneously,” the person familiar with the Pfizer development said. “We started setting up the supply chain in March, while the vaccine was still being developed. That’s totally unprecedented.”Pfizer and BioNtech are now on track to roll out 1.3 billion vaccines in 2021 and the 50 million dose shortfall this year will be covered as production ramps up.The company is setting up what it has described as its biggest ever vaccination campaign through two final assembly and distribution centers in Kalamazoo, Mich., and Puurs, Belgium, which will handle the European supply.The U.K. authorization marks a milestone in the effort to develop a promising new vaccine technology into a widely available shot in record time.The U.K. ordered 40 million Pfizer doses, enough to vaccinate 20 million people. The government said in November that it could get up to 10 million doses this year, but the expectation now is that four to five million vaccines will be shipped.

## U.K. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the shots will be rolled out as quickly as they can be made at Pfizer’s Belgium plant. Some 800,000 are due in the coming days and “several millions” throughout December, he said.

The U.S. government has placed an initial order for 100 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine, with the option to purchase 500 million additional doses.The EU ordered 200 million doses with an option for another 100 million. Japan ordered 120 million doses, and countries in South America and in the Asia-Pacific region also have placed significant orders.

XPO Is Splitting in Two. The CEO Explains Why That Will Be Good for the Stock. -- Barrons.com

2020-12-03, 11:54 AM
Stock in XPO Logistics was rising Thursday after the company announced plans to split in two. CEO Bradley Jacobs thinks that will create even more value for shareholders. Based on peer valuations, it looks as if he has a point. And shares could rise further as investors start valuing the company as two stand-alone entities.

XPO (ticker: XPO) will create one company dedicated to outsourced warehousing -- a business it calls contract logistics. The other company will be dedicated to truck brokerage and less-than-truckload shipping.

Less than truckload, or LTL, refers to trucks that aren't always full and carry freight shorter distances. Old Dominion Freight Line (ODFL) is a large pure-play LTL stock.

XPO's truck brokerage competes with the likes of C.H. Robinson Worldwide (CHRW). That business arranges shipping for smaller customers, aggregating loads and matching them with trucking fleets. Any brokerage business, essentially, matches buyers and sellers.

XPO's contract logistics includes about 800 warehouses the company runs for customers. That business, according to Jacobs, is booming as e-commerce volumes explode. "There are secular tailwinds," he said. Large customers are accelerating logistics outsourcing as e-commerce volumes explode. What's more, factory automation is driving down the costs for players such as XPO. "You go to our warehouses, you see a lot of robots."

XPO started looking at strategic alternatives back in January. "Our [ valuation] multiple was too low," Jacobs said in an interview. "You can't fight the market. You have to accept it. The market valued a complex company less than a pure-play company."

In the case of trucking, Old Dominion and CH Robinson trade for about 17 times and 15 times estimated 2021 Ebitda, short for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, respectively. XPO Logistics trades for about 9 times the comparable estimate.

In the case of contract logistics, peers such as DSV Panalpina (DSDVY) and others trade for about 12 times estimated 2021 Ebitda.

Roughly two thirds of XPO sales and Ebitda are from trucking. The rest is from contract logistics. If both portions of the business traded like peers, XPO would be worth about $20 billion as an entity, deducting out debt, leaving the stock about $150 to $170 a share.

Wall Street sees value in valuation-multiple arbitrage. Citigroup analyst Christian Wetherbee called the valuation straight forward and sees upside for shares. He rates them Buy and has a $138 price target for the stock. Wells Fargo analyst Allison Poliniak-Cusic wrote that she views the move positively. She rates the stock Buy with a target price of $158.

XPO stock was up 6.2% to $116.89 near midday. The S&amp;amp;amp;P 500 was up about 0.3% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.6% higher.

Debt is one thing standing in the way of a higher multiple. Excluding leases, XPO has about $4.5 billion of net debt, about three times Ebitda earned over the past 12 months. Jacobs wants to bring that down. "We want both companies to be investment grade," he said.

Investment-grade ratings might be another positive catalyst for the stock multiple. The split is expected to be completed by the second half of 2021.

That being said, there are some positions I'd be interested in closing but I'm confused on terminology as it pertains to applicable CapGains tax - namely "individual shares" vs "stock" and how cap gains tax is applied.

For an illustrative example, let's say I buy 10 shares of MSFT on 3/13/20. Then on 5/11 I buy 10 more. Then on 9/15 I buy 10 more. 

If I sell ANY before 3/13/21 I pay short term captial gains tax (highest tax rate) - that part is easy. 

But on the flip side, let's say on 3/14/21, I want to sell & take profit. Are only the "first" 10 shares I purchased which have now been held more than a year subject to the long-term (lower) tax rate? i.e. Can I sell all 30 and qualify for long-term cap gains tax rate since I've held a *stock position* in the company for >1yr? Or is it dependent on the share acquisition date so the 20 that have been held for <1yr be subject to higher taxes?

TL;DR - When does the clock start for the 1yr capital gains taxes threshold, at initial entry into a company or at actual time of acquisition of each individual share? 

(Disclaimer: the MSFT example is purely for explaining my question, I do not have any positions in MSFT)

 Ive been using a online simulator working on my long term dividend inventing strategies, but recently funded a TD account  with $100 and noticed ACI was dropping a little so I looked into it. I like ACI because they seam to be expanding and growing at a nice rate even before the end of the world. they had a nice dividend recently; and believe that Rona or no Rona people gotta eat. The market though is "upset" because they kept the cash from the IPO in house and used it to pay back 401k etc.  The only place I can find people bitching is Yahoo, and some of them are claiming the whole this is kupt and the CEO "tricked" all of us.

So, since I think I’m going to be a pretty conservative investor, who buys stocks which business models are stable, revenues are growing and the debt is well managed. Also, the company has a dividend which is raised consistantly and is preferably among the market leaders of a certain sector. 

So, to the question: If a company has all these things that I listed above, does it really matter when I hop in, if I’ll be aiming my targets to the next 10 years? Or even more, let’s say 20 or even 30 if the company is still healthy. If I just do dollar cost averaging and won’t be selling (probably at all) is it ok to buy the stock if its price is a little steep? Thanks to dollar cost averaging, my portfolio will have a bigger slice of stocks that are bought at a cheaper price and a smaller slice of stocks that are bought at a greater price.

Any advice helps._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ If BABA, NIO, XPEV (Chinese stocks) are delisted, what will happen to the stock prices for US investors? I own a lot in leaps on BABA and also some in NIO. The house yesterday passed the bill yesterday that the Chinese companies will have to, like all other foreign companies, have to comply with auditing regulations which involves working directly with the Chinese officials in China (much more access than what we have now). (Even though it hurts my wallet, I definitely agree with the legislation). Right now we own ADRs \[ "An ADR is a stock that trades in the U.S. but represents a specified number of shares in a foreign corporation. ADRs are bought and sold on American stock markets just like regular stocks, and are issued/sponsored by a U.S. by a bank or brokerage."\]

Let's say the Chinese government \*doesn't\* comply (which is what I believe because this would be something they'd do). Thus, in 3 years the stocks which we own we'd have to move over to a foreign exchange (Hong Kong or London I'm guessing) if we still wanted to keep them. Remember this isn't a decision companies can make. The Chinese government will \*have\* to comply. So the CEOs of these companies can do all they want to try and make themselves compliant but it won't matter if the Chinese government doesn't comply so the possibility of delisting is very real.

My questions are three-fold:

1. Would the fact that US investors can no longer buy these ADRs mean the price of BABA (and other Chinese companies) tank? Or does the supply and demand of US investors not affect the price of the stock at all since this is basically just tied to a foreign stock and the relative supply and demand of US investors is irrelevant?
2. As a related question, the market cap of BABA right now is 800B. Is this market cap of 800B from both the stock on the Chinese exchange PLUS the market cap from US investors? Or is this \*solely\* the market cap on its foreign exchange? In other words, if I buy 10 million shares of the stock at market price on TD Ameritrade in the US, would this even  have any effect on the stock price I'm seeing at all?
3. How would owning leaps work out if the stock were to become delisted? Would I have to exercise them and then transfer over?  Are the options solely dependent on the supply and demand of US investors or are these like ADR's of the options on another exchange? Let's say a leap I own still had an extrinsic value of $3000 on it. The next day it's announced the stock will become delisted (let's pretend they could announce it and delist it the next day). Would this mean my leaps would become worthless almost instantly because there would be no investors willing to buy that remaining extrinsic value?

The reason this is so important is because if it's the case US investors have no impact on the stock price itself, then I still remain bullish on these stocks since nothing has changed with the company fundamentally. If however US investors no longer being able to buy the ADR does have an effect on the price, then I want to sell everything because no one wants to own a stock that could potentially die a few years later.

**EDIT (read):** It's quite strange to me that a lot of these comments are taking this question as a referendum on Chinese stocks in general and just filled with people either bullish or bearish on NIO or BABA who are hating on the question even for asking. First, you don't know what will happen. Second, I myself am bullish on both still! I've had BABA for years and NIO for 6 months. I believe in the companies; however I don't believe the Chinese government will definitely agree to these new demands. And even if they do down the line within the next 3 years, who in the US would want to own a stock whose momentum would inevitably be stunted by the question of "will these possibly be delisted in a few years time?".

THUS, that's why the singular important question, the answer I have yet to get anything definitively answered on, is >>> ***Does the supply and demand of US investors affect the price of the stock at all ?   In other words, if I buy 10 million shares of the stock at market price on TD Ameritrade in the US, would this even have any effect on the stock price I'm seeing at all (since buying this many shares should increase the price)?***  <<<<  THIS is the key. If it's the case US investors will have no effect on the stock price we're seeing, then all the speculation about the deal going through is irrelevant. I'd remain bullish on the company because US interest or lack thereof would be immaterial. **So this question is, at its core, about the intricacies of how ADR's work. And, regardless of your position on Chinese companies, this should interest anyone who is investing in not only Chinese companies, but any foreign company- whether that be BABA, NIO, Mercado Libre, StoneCo, Royal Dutch Shell, Nestle, etc.** So why anyone would dislike such a reasonable inquiry is beyond me.

That's why it's important that singular question is answered by someone here who knows. He who knows is the winner!

TLDR: Was selling some calls (SPY 12/23 $379) I had open this morning and somehow in the process opened a call that I don't have anywhere near enough collateral for. 


Here's what happened.

This morning I was selling 2 SPY calls I had open. Didn't realize I had two open, so I sold 1 and then the other. My broking app said I still had a call open so I sold that one as well. 

Then my broking app was starting to glitch out so I reset my phone, and when I opened it I noticed I had a call sell opened now. 

I only just started working with options, and was trying to avoid creating my own options, and just stick to buying them. My understanding is that on expiration of this call I am on the hook for providing 100 shares of SPY at $379. Is this correct? 

And if so, I only have $1000 in my account, not the 300,000 that I would need to cover this. SPY is a consistent grower and I don't expect this option to end out of the money.

My understanding is that I can buy a call for the same price, and that would be enough to cover the call I managed to create when it expires, is this correct?

And if so, what does this mean in terms of my account? How much would I be on the hook for?

**As an individual company, we won't be able to comment on this topic which is still going through the process. Please refer to our public filings for the company's information.**

While according to [Barrons](https://www.barrons.com/articles/house-passes-china-delisting-bill-what-that-means-for-nio-li-auto-and-xpeng-stock-51606952640), a spokeswoman said NIO believes it's in compliance with the new law.

NIO's spokeswoman responded to an emailed statement from Barron's saying NIO was aware of the situation and became compliant over the past few months.

The Barrons report noted that Li Auto's prospectus illustrates the issue: "The audit report included in this prospectus is prepared by an auditor who is not inspected by the PCAOB and, as such, our investors are deprived of the benefits of such inspection."

"In addition, the adoption of any rules, legislations or other efforts to increase US regulatory access to audit information could cause uncertainty, and we could be delisted if we are unable to meet the PCAOB inspection requirement in time."

That language was included in Li Auto's December 2 Securities and Exchange Commission filing. Similar language is part of XPeng and NIO SEC filings from August.

Let’s talk about what happened yesterday in the stock market**

Hey everyone! So, let’s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw both the [DOW JONES](https://ibb.co/sKKNVjr) and the [SP500](https://ibb.co/PzxfrWt) up about 0,2% with the SP closing at a new record high while the [NASDAQ COMPOSITE](https://ibb.co/f909849) trailed and finished just below the previous close, down only 0,05%. We did see a spike in the [VIX](https://ibb.co/QMqhtMv) of almost 2% as this was quite a volatile day with the market dropping at the open before regaining traction in the middle of the trading day. We saw a relatively even market yesterday as 56% of companies were advancing on below average volume as most of the companies continue to trade well above the moving averages. The leading [sectors](https://ibb.co/d0740g8) yesterday were Energy and Financials with Materials and Real Estate lagging the market as [Small and Large Cap value plays](https://ibb.co/hLDgLmm) kept the market positive with companies like Boeing being up [more than 5%](https://ibb.co/b3jRN2s) for the day after good news on multiple fronts like Ryanair [probably](https://ibb.co/8xpKXxQ) acquiring new planes and the [first flights made](https://ibb.co/qmJNkPc) with the new 737 by American.

[STOCK MARKET CHART](https://ibb.co/BPVFx2d)

Here is a complete [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/TKsdbDn) from yesterday as we saw an even market as I said earlier, with Salesforce being the only big looser in big caps as the stock continued to dive after the Slack news. I think this was a great opportunity to buy the stock in a dip as I doubled my portfolio value on the company from 1,5% to 3% of my portfolio while also getting in [more](https://ibb.co/Pr47Th5) on Boeing, Apple, Netflix and a couple of other companies.

We also got the AAII investor sentiment [survey](https://ibb.co/KxkbTbb) yesterday as the percentage of bulls has increased constantly in the last month. This is usually a very bad sign for the stock market as corrections, consolidations or even crashes occur when people tend be over-bullish. I don’t think this will be the case at least for a couple of weeks, though I think we are poised for a small market correction in the near future before moving on even higher.

Here is the most interesting [economic data](https://ibb.co/PD2XBsn) that will be released today as we get new jobless claims as well as services PMI and ISM. I expect the jobless claims to continue to get worse sadly for the next couple of weeks at least until the vaccine starts to get distributed with ADP November jobs [numbers](https://ibb.co/S6V64xJ) coming in yesterday shy of forecasts and at the lowest level since July, this is not great news for the jobless claims that will pop up early today. [CALENDAR](https://ibb.co/wQ3mK2b)

Great news came in this morning as the US is [expected](https://ibb.co/vYp0LDT) to have capability to immunize at least 100 million people by the end of February, that is great news, as specialist believe a herd immunity can be reached if there are about 60-80% of people either immunized or have already developed natural antibodies.

We also have a couple of interesting earnings [scheduled](https://ibb.co/6nJjrRY) for Today, as I expect Kroger to beat the estimates, though I didn’t get any action on this, I did get some [action](https://ibb.co/y0ThT5D) on [Marvell](https://ibb.co/34x6mpN) as I bought the stock about a week ago. While I expected Dollar General to do alright and I think we might see some disappointment in [DocuSign](https://ibb.co/BPsz5Mj) just like I thought we would see bad reaction to great earnings with Zoom.

\[Later Edit:

\-Dollar General [reported](https://ibb.co/gJPRpXM) a beat on top & bottom line but did not offer guidance and the shares of the company have pulled back in pre-market trading 1,6%

\-Kroger [beats EPS](https://ibb.co/bgsMckw) by 0,05$ but misses on revenue by $310M, shares down 4% pre-market\]

Alongside Marvell which I expect to beat the estimates of 25cents per share and also beat on revenue, I also [bought](https://ibb.co/y0ThT5D) Okta which released earnings yesterday and [crushed](https://ibb.co/VmvBzYV) expectations as recurring [subscription revenue](https://ibb.co/nftnckz) grew by more than 40% year over year as well as big increases in operating margins, billings and customers. This led the stock to [spike 8%](https://ibb.co/xzyy0qr) after hours as I will make a good profit on the investment and may even consider holding this position for the long term in the company.

Also, one other staple company from my [portfolio](https://ibb.co/pKbNy8M), CrowdStrike released earnings yesterday and delivered great [results](https://ibb.co/dgyfn8g) as the annual recurring [revenue](https://ibb.co/N6vhWfW) has grown more than 80% year over year while adding over 11hundred new subscriptions this quarter while also improving [gross margins](https://ibb.co/THfGJ2c) by 2%. The company also gave guidance for next quarter way over analyst expectations as that made the [stock soar 13%](https://ibb.co/ZGxbsRx)

The only big disappointment from earnings released yesterday was [SNOWFLAKE](https://ibb.co/6BhYKHC) as they have suffered the same way as Palantir in the first earnings report as analysts were expecting even bigger numbers after the huge rally the stock has had since the IPO. One Morgan Stanley analyst said that they needed to deliver around a 140% growth of revenue to make a good impact on the stock as the company’s revenue only grew up 102%. If it continues to drop it might find the way to a good entry point, but for the moment I believe this price is to high for the company.

We also got news yesterday as the House [passed](https://ibb.co/w0Ly1MP) the billt hat allows Chinese companies to be delisted if they do not comply with new auditing rules, as this measure is expected to by signed fast by Trump.

I think this is good news for investors in the long-run as I don’t believe big companies like Alibaba will suffer from this, with BABA being audited by established PWC Hong Kong auditors, though this might be a bigger problem for smaller companies that are not able to follow the rules. I still believe Alibaba is a great company to buy at this price point as the company has [dropped](https://ibb.co/W283kbG) due to bad news developments in the last 2 months, but I think has a lot of room to go higher, even testing the previous highs of 319$ and surpassing them, especially with this holiday season having great sales numbers.

This news combined with the recent [upgrade](https://ibb.co/c2mwgPc) at Goldman was music to the ears of Tesla investors as the stock rose almost 3% after hours and erased the daily losses.

Other news came as the House is expected to vote on the [MORE ACT](https://ibb.co/RgjnPgY), though this will be surely blocked in the Senate, this is still good news for the cannabis sector as states will likely legalize this way before we can a national bill.

While Palantir dropped big yesterday after Morgan Stanley [warned](https://ibb.co/m4NsSWr) for a negative-risk reward in the stock as the stock has dropped more than 20% in the last 5 trading days, I sold out of my position on Palantir for a 40% profit recently but I may get back in if the price starts to make more sense.

So, with the latest developments, I believe investors should not forget about the FAANG stocks that have brought us back from the depths of the March lows. [FACEBOOK](https://ibb.co/gFd1S5R) still gives small business that will be back when the economy returns the best bang for the buck in advertising, especially with the great platform that Instagram has become.

While [APPLE](https://ibb.co/j4YW4Qy) seems to be doing very well with the iPhone 12 sales and the new 5G cycle while also growing the services business very fast, that will bring them more and more steady cash flows for the company.

Despite missing the latest sub numbers, [NETFLIX](https://ibb.co/LJ8fr37), is still producing a lot of great content, has the most subs and the most content available for streaming and I believe they will remain the best in business alongside with Disney+

What can you say about [AMAZON](https://ibb.co/nrD5qnY) as they are a death star for every sector they get in… E-commerce is here to stay, and Amazon still has huge room for growth especially in Europe and Asia.

While [GOOGLE](https://ibb.co/tz2htpn) was the laggard for most of the year, with travel & entertainment returning to advertising, this will be very good for the company, as travel is the biggest advertiser usually.

This companies will remain great owns for the long run, even if they underperform now, which I don’t expect, in the long-run this will remain some of the biggest winners in this new economy.

And don’t forget December is usually a great month for stocks as people tend to not take profits on capital gains at the end of the year, so it is likely that people will keep the winners while also receiving a boost from the stock market Santa Claus effect.

They've lost a quarter of a billion dollars this year, and only managed to pay back some debt recently that they have owed since March. The reason they've been shorted so much is because they're literally irrelevant in today's society with common internet speeds where you can download a 80gig game in 2 hours.

I understand the "used games" angle... but what Sony and Microsoft will probably do is just release some kind of "season pass" thing where they can take that market as well by offering a discount on older games, or revoking access to games you own to put credit towards different games. Everything is moving online, especially in the era of covid.

I’ve been having significant gains by just holding the shares. I was told that I can do options and gain both ways from the options plus the shares owned. 
I only know about buying calls/puts if I do not own shares. So in this case, since I own shares I SELL calls/puts, right? If so, if I’m bullish on the stock should I sell puts or sell calls? And what about when I’m bearish on the stock, sell calls or puts? If anyone can be informative here, that will be very appreciated.

This is based on 100 billion in stock buys/TSLA being valued at 500 billion.

Or do i have to hold the entirety of tomorrow, meaning close my positions monday morning? 

In simple terms, in order to meet the requirements for payout date for dividends, can the investor sell early on record date, or is there some sort of timely sensitivity here?

Margins should increase significantly & it still has the “name brand” that many people associate with weight loss, even if there is no real barrier to entry into the space.

This time of year (post-Thanksgiving, winter) is a big time for health and fitness in general & coupled with the pandemic it seems like many companies are primed to take advantage of the inactivity of Americans.

What really piqued my interest though, was while I was watching this interview my wife mentioned how OrangeTheory had recently both called and emailed her regarding how she would feel about a potential “Partnership” with them.

From what I can tell, there are at least 1200+ OrangeTheory locations across the country and it is extremely popular at least where I am. They have done a good job of customer service and offering a lot of online stuff to supplement the workouts. They have recently opened studios at 50% capacity where I am.  I think a partnership would do a good job of increasing subscribers, even if only on a trial basis. Yet I couldn’t really find any news about anyone talking about this.

The stock peaked in 2018 when it brought in Oprah and it still hasn’t recovered from pre-covid levels. It might not, but this seems like a good opportunity to buy low, especially if they can see some success from their digital transformation.

I bought some $35 1/15/20 calls the other day on a whim and am already up over 60% on them. 

What do you think, is there something to this thesis?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Positivity for newbies without a lot of $ to invest Hey! I'm pretty new to this, but if you are too and you're anything like me, you've probably seen a lot of people talking about how they've bought 300 shares of this, dropped $2k on that, have six figures in ETFs, etc. I've even seen a couple comments scoffing at people who only have a couple hundred to invest. I dunno about you, but it can get frustrating and disheartening. So I just wanted to take a minute and say: you're doing great just by getting started!

It really doesn't matter how much money you have. Sure, the more you can invest, the more you can (potentially) gain, but any profit is profit. If you want to get into trading like a lot of people do here, it's perfectly okay to start with $100, buy a share or two in something that seems reliable yet cheap, make like $5, sell it, rinse and repeat. You can work your way up to doubling or tripling your initial investment by just buying a good stock on a red day, waiting a few days, and selling when it's in the green by a few dollars. It's not as glamorous or fast as people talking about their $10k gains in a day but it is profit, it can be faster than long-term investing when you're just getting started, and it does allow you more money to play with without having to put in more of your own.

And if you want to start investing long-term, any amount is a great amount. $100 in a savings account might make 0.20% APY, like what my bank offers. $100 in ETFs could get you ~10% annual returns. $10 in a year doesn't sound like much, but it's a massive improvement over 20¢. (And you'll almost definitely put aside more than $100 year to year anyway, but you get the point.)

All in all, any profit is profit, the best amount to trade with is anything you can afford to lose, the best time to start long-term investing is always immediately, and it's perfectly fine if all you're making is a few dollars trading or investing. The important part is that you're getting started, so don't get discouraged! Best of luck to all of us =)


p.s. Also, IMO, short-term trading is okay! As long as you know the risks (yes, even of meme stocks) you can treat this as a game or a casino or whatever you want. Like someone else here said, this is /r/stocks, not /r/investing. At the end of the day it's your money, and sometimes stupid-seeming risks will make way more profit overnight than safe long-term investments will in years, and sometimes you'll lose your life's savings in a day and wish you'd just gone the investing route with $VOO or something. Do whatever you're comfortable with, don't listen to anyone scoffing about what investing has become. (Although, I guess, take what I've said with a grain of salt too! I am probably just as new as you ;b Feel free to correct me on anything as well!)_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ General question about investing in international stocks Given the amount of headlines about Chinese stocks in recent times, my question is what drives the sentiments of investors (and traders) to invest in international stocks that do not have markets in their countries? I guess my sentiment is that while some of these companies may become the top dogs in their respective countries, the growth do not necessarily affect the everyday life nor the economy around them. Is it just purely for returns? BTW I do have holdings of international stocks, but investing in these stocks certainly don't feel as tangible as investing in US stocks, which also lowers my risk tolerance international stocks (not discussing the possibility of frauds). 

Some examples of Chinese stocks are the popular XPeng and Li Auto (not so much NIO as they have more talks about oversea expansion), as well as more established companies like JD, Bili. Obviously my sentiments apply to companies in other parts of the world too._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Should I choose greed or fear I came across a company in August this year (I wont state the name to keep the view unbiased). The company is coming out of a long downward cycle and was at an extremely attractive valuation in August as the company has a stable business and a very positive future outlook. Even at a reserved estimation, the company stock could be a five-bagger.

I had the money to invest then, but I delayed to go all in as I was not sure how the market was going to turn out. I just invested about 5% of the maximum I can invest in the company. Till October the stock price had risen about 25% from the prices in August and I got a feeling that the market also seems to agree with me on the company's future prospects.

This is when greed took over. Considering my estimates, the October prices would still give me a 4-4.5 bagger stock. However, I thought that if I could wait till the next correction event (US election, second wave of the pandemic etc), I could still get the stock at the 5-bagger levels.

Alas, as you all know how the stock market turned out since the start of November, I missed that opportunity as well. The company stock has risen another 25% and has reduced my prospective returns to 3.5-4 bagger range.

The question I have is this: **should I wait for another correction event (greed) or should I just buy the stock at the current price and be done with it (fear), accepting that I made a blunder and lost a prospective 1.5x of my investment income?**

I know I have made a huge mistake and in hindsight should have bought the stock any time between August to October (or at least done a DCA).

Confirm if that is correct._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Battery EVs and GE - power plant construction must accelerate and the ancient company wins General Electric wins greatly from battery-only EVs regardless of which EV maker prevails !

EVs charging overnight will drag on the utility grid greatly. GE makes the major capital equipment pieces that go into making new electric power plants. They have a wind power division. Siemens is there too, but the positive impact on GE's biz is twice that of Siemens \[factor of power plant systems supply sales to whole company sales\].

Does it matter that a lot of that product is natural gas turbines? Aren't all gasoline free, battery EVs supposed to just use clean energy and the discerning EV buyer will insist on 0% carbon emissions power plants?

You know EV buyers are oblivious to that, because you have read all their posts online. Their first instinct is to buy the car because its cool and they are good hearted (no sarcasm). But later they justify the purchase by agreeing with certain truths and discounting less convenient truths.  Such as:

In eastern Massachusetts 52% of grid electricity is generated by burning something. 35% is nat gas. 6% is even burning trash.\[source: National Grid 2020 mailer\]

Doing up 11 pages (too long to share fully here) I calculated that GE will see a flip from -2% profit at its power biz to at least a +2% profit, with overall company sales up 21% if all non power plant and wind related divisions had flat sales going forward.  So this 21% has nothing to do with the MAX737 engine stuff.  It is independent of that, so add whatever % sales regrowth you see fit regarding the rest of GE's businesses.   I thought 12% sales increase for Siemens. It seems to be a duopoly situation, quite unlike the multitude of companies that make the EV cars and go at it Wrestle Mania style.

I know there are solar panels on roofs and home power storage and inverter products. My assumption is that the $7,000 to $9,000 cost of the equipment alone, pre install labor will deter most EV owners. I expect the vast majority will charge with wall outlet adapters with no home solar system.

I am an electrical engineer. I will share a numbers highlight from my 11 page write up.  I admit to a few assumptions that I hope are reasonable.

2018's new power plant construction was 30.7 GigaWatts total output capability \[source: [eia.gov](https://eia.gov)\].  I think this included distribution loss.  I assimilated some assorted vehicle charge expenditure information using the average commute distance in the USA and got 0.000001916 GW per vehicle to charge over a 7.384 hour period (that time duration is a result from another calc).  I assume all EVs are charging at a slow rate at roughly the same time in the USA at night, with some time zone staggering. I used 88.9% charge efficiency \[source: bigislandev.org\]. (30.7 GW x 0.889) / 0.000001916 GW = 14.2 million EV's. The entire global personal vehicle market is around 54 million cars sold in one year. So you see, if EVs gain penetration to around 14.2/54 = 26% market share...

It would consume all the output capability of all power plants newly built at the rate they were built in 2018. Cars built per year, power plants built per year. I am using annual numbers in both cases.

So bottom line -- every power plant newly built would be able to do nothing but support charging electric vehicles during sleeping hours if the acceptance of battery based EVs reached 26%. QED!! Building power plants must accelerate greatly, and from what I can find, only Siemens and General Electric can address that market need to that scale. Again, in proportion to overall sales General Electric benefits about 2x more than Siemens.

My belief that all battery based EVs are charging at home at night during the same time region turns out to be an extremely important point!  I assume that at company parking lots there will not be EV charging available because it costs a company money.  I also assume that stores and malls will only put up a few token charging stations.  This just enough for the mall to say "we're green" but not sink a ton of money into having many charging stations.

Back to those affording home solar systems and invertors in the home to be "off grid":  just increase the 26% market penetration that EVs would need to saturate the new power plants by a proportion of those you think will have that system. Something like 26 x 1.1 if you think 10% of EV buyers will install a full home solar and storage solution, etc.

Please feel free to shoot at this with critique.  I don't see any free public studies out there touching on this grid loading.

Note that I also assume that all previously existing power plants are dedicated to the loading of today for all other typical purposes, before EVs got going.  In other words, I assign the newly built power plants in a given year the duty of charging the newly arriving EVs.  Fun huh?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Short term high yield investment guide Hi all

First of let’s get things settled by covering the basics

I don’t own meme stocks
I don’t buy meme stocks 
I average 10% per month although I hit a recent run with Covid that shot my month on month to over 50% gains

I have a few basic rules for investing although they aren’t buffet rules and there are 7(?) of them

0 : if I can predict it I will trade, if I can not I stay the fuck away.

1. I know the discount cash flow fair value of all my stocks, it’s always higher then share trading price for a buy. Overpriced stocks may go up, but I can’t guarantee it. Lots of stock info sites provide discount cash flow fair value already calculated.

2. I do not trade against the trend, but I do not expect a trend to continue forever, simple chart analysis to determine average trend following time

3. I always have a mark price, I always have a cash out at the Mark price. Stonks may go up past it, but I can’t predict it, so I’m gone by that point.

4.  If I see a sock hit a resistance level, I sell and buy once it’s bounced back down (if interday) free 1-2% is free

5. News, dividends, and trends are god, if I buy in advance they make stocks move reliably up by 5-10%.

5b. I don’t need to take a dividend to profit off a dividend. Dividends just lubricate sticky stocks and make them move in a nice reliable direction.

6. Buying stocks is more reliably profitable then buying options, most stocks do not move fast enough to make options worth 

6b. If it feels right I will take out long range positions on options. These positions are on stocks that will move significantly on news, are undervalued, and I know the news is coming (best example is $PFE right now, a nice steady crawl upwards that you could see coming a month in advance)

7. You have 100k, this means you can either buy 100k of one stock that looks great and hope for the best, or buy 20k in 5 stocks and hope you were right more often then you were wrong. I do the latter.

7b.  cause you know I’m a fuckup, I know I’m a fuckup, but as long as I’m a fuckup only once or twice I’m a rich fuckup and I stay that way!

If you think I’m wrong see file 7b

Let's face it 2020 left fundamentals and value investing in the dust, but with their earnings being announced this Friday, maybe what your portfolio needs is a pure value investment so here is my DD on Big Lots. They have been undergoing the greatest COVID-19 comeback story that you never heard of, growing sales 31% QoQ and earnings per share 61% but lets focus on the basics.

First let's look at the basic Metrics and Ratios:

|Share Price|**$52.60**|
|:-|:-|
|Market Cap|**2.05B**|
|Sales(12 months)|**5.86B**|
|Income(12 months)|**722.00M**|
|Price/Earnings(P/E)|**2.88**|
|Price/Sales(P/S)|**0.35**|
|Profit Margin|**12.30%**|

No that's not a typo! Big Lots which is already up 250% since March low is still trading at a ridiculously low PE of 2.88

But u/taiwansteez *PE iSnT EvErYtHiNg!!* They must have terrible cash flows and a lot of debt right?

WRONG!! They have $0.00 current debt and only $43M long term debt.

In the 26 week period from 2/1/20 to 8/1/20 they generated $845M\* in Free Cash Flow while paying off $236M long term debt and a $24M dividends([10-Q Statement of Cash Flows](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/768835/000076883520000137/big-20200801.htm#id8c0840f5e4a474bbb923a3aeb8e9fb9_31)). Ending the quarter sitting on $898.56M cash on hand. (\*$587M was from the sale their Rancho Cucamonga fulfillment and distribution center)

|Price/Free Cash Flow(P/FCF)|**4.77**|
|:-|:-|
|Debt/Equity|**0.00**|
|Long term Debt/Equity|**0.03**|
|Price/Cash (P/C)|**2.28**|

Hol' up. wait. Did you say dividend? Damn straight $24M aka 2.29% yield for my boomers.

So what happened? How did they go from losing money in 2019 to 12% profit margins in less than a year? Answer: COVID 19 baby. Like all consumer defensive discount stores Big Lots does well in an economic downturn because people emphasize saving money. Big Lots was late to the ecommerce game and only started focusing on ecommerce and updating their fulfillment centers last year 2019 which is a big part of why they've performed so poorly in the last few years. But with the acceleration online shopping due to the pandemic, they got lucky to have the infrastructure in place to capitalize. The result? 31% same stores sales growth and 61% earnings growth.

In conclusion: BIG value.

Strong cash flow, virtually no debt, growing same store sales, solid dividend, very undervalued.

If you've made it this far and still think this is a value trap let's compare these numbers to their competitors in the discount stores segment. We will be looking at Dollar General(DG), Dollar Tree(DLTR), BJ's Wholesale Club(BJ), Ollie's Bargain Outlet(OLLI), Pricesmart(PSMT), Target(TGT), Walmart(WMT), and Costco(COST).

As you can see $BIG is almost criminally undervalued, beating every single company in all but two metrics , still significantly below the industry average. So low in fact that to be perfectly honest I have no idea why this stock is so cheap. My guess would be because A) it's a relatively small and obscure company so not many investors have it on their radar. B) It has already performed so well 85% YTD, 250% since March beating every company on this list, so now investors that do have it on their radar are waiting for this Friday's earnings to see if they keep the same momentum

This Friday's earnings will be a very BIG deal, if WMT, TGT, FIVE are any indicators I think they will post big numbers and the stock will start to take off once again. From a valuation standpoint alone they should be *at least* a $10B company.

Disclosure: I am holding 250 shares as well as 12/18 60C, & 12/18 62.50C.

Be careful if you choose to go with options because IV is already up a lot in anticipation of earnings and the overall volume is very low._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Trade in IRA?

Shareholders will get $26.79 in cash and 0.0776 shares of CRM for each WORK share based on CRM's closing price on Nov 30, 2020.

Here's the thing though - "the transaction is anticipated to close in the second quarter of Salesforce’s fiscal year 2022". What happens in the meantime? Both stocks will obviously move, most likely much higher. But the reports state that you'll get a fixed amount of cash and shares at a fixed price. Aren't we losing by continuing to hold WORK then? Or did I get the date wrong?

Also, what happens if your account doesn't support fractional shares? Will the broker give you a whole number of shares and pay out the rest in cash?

Thanks_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Is there any point in investing in multiple ETFs such as QQQ, VOO, and VTI vs just one of them? Was wondering whether there are any benefits in doing this. Is it just for diversification, or are the other benefits that I am not seeing.

Espoo, Finland – A new study by Nokia and Telefónica has found that 5G networks are up to 90 percent more energy efficient per traffic unit than legacy 4G networks. The research, which was conducted over a three-month period, focused on the power consumption of the Radio Access Network (RAN) in Telefónica’s network.

Aston Martin (AML) is a great brand (James Bond's official car) and a British icon.

It's been in trouble in the last couple of years though (not due to Covid). Share price 80% down.

Recent News:

1. Head of AMG Mercedes has now become the new CEO of Aston Martin
2. Mercedes Benz (Daimler) bought 20% of the shares.

See: [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-54712376](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-54712376)

Share's have gone up 30-40%, but there is still room for a 5-10x even to go back at the price of a couple of years back.

&#x200B;

What do you guys think? Having the backing of Daimler matters?

With that said, don't be surprised to wake up and see that PLTR is in the red. Every dollar this goes up with result in a lot of meme investors LEAVING at their break even point. That means for every step forward, it will take one back.

The good news is that as green days increase, more real investors will come in and meme investors will become fewer and fewer.

This will continue until for possibly weeks (or months) until it eventually shakes off everyone who is itching it leave. That is when organic growth can begin. Once it reaches a new ATH it will be ready to take off again. Not like it has in the past, but in a real way.

Enjoy the rollercoaster and congrats for picking a winning company._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Why professional traders are not worried about the Delisting Bill that passed today -- Barons While people are panicking on Reddit and Stocktwits...

>The bill won’t come as a surprise to investors. Emerging markets fund managers have been swapping U.S. listings of widely held stocks like Alibaba Group Holding (BABA), JD.com (JD), NetEase (NTES) for their secondary listings in Hong Kong listings for months, in anticipation of the measure. 

That's right. The absolute *worst* thing that can happen is that your shares get swapped to Hong Kong's stock exchange. The article explained that Interactive Brokers, Fidelity, and Schwab, for example, already offer retail traders like us access to HK's exchange.

Granted that NIO and XPEV are not on the Hong Kong exchange yet. But they have three years to comply with the US rule. That's plenty of time to secure a spot on the Hong Kong exchange. And Hong Kong would *love* to have them. This move could also benefit the companies themselves, as it makes them available to both American *and* Chinese investors:

>A Hong Kong listing means a company’s stock can be traded during the Asian day and is likely to broaden its investor base. If shares are later added to Hong Kong’s so-called stock connect program, they could also become accessible to investors in mainland China. [WSJ](https://archive.fo/XRXPe#selection-2677.0-2677.262)

**tl;dr** Worst thing that happens is you have to open another account to give you access to HKEX. That's assuming a compromise doesn't get reached. And that's assuming Biden even signs this bill._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Business Education Podcast: Features Billionaire Investor Tim Draper, and Forbes 30 under 30 top venture capitalist from Google.

Was thinking of playing puts on this one cause as always buy the rumor sell the news, RSI on the monthly and yearly is at 83 the highest it’s been seen December of last year which was followed by a massive downswing. Thoughts?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Why do stocks sometimes move ridiculous amounts after hours? I know this sounds like a n00b question but, I have given this thought for a long time, and I simply cannot come to any conclusion outside of manipulation.  Why is it that some stocks will exceed their daily range after hours on zero news?  Or put differently, if a stock traded between 110-115 for 3 days and tens of millions of shares, why would an investor choose to buy at 130 or sell at 95 in after hours?  For what reason does someone arrive at the conclusion that at this very second I must buy, but three hours ago when the price was way better was not the right time?  I will give some examples.

For one, everyones favorite stock TSLA opened today at 556 and closed at 567, with like 50 million shares trading.  Currently, a couple hours after market close, its at 585.  Its traded like 1.5 million shares since close.   Many of these orders are for several hundred shares at a time, so its not like, the average redditor.  I'm not complaining and I'm not short, I just think its ridiculous.

Another one is CVNA.  Is it the most overvalued company in existence?  sure, probably.  Yesterday it opened around 252 and closed around 251, with a low of 242 in between.  This morning it opened 230, and of course it retraced a bit on open.  It closed at 226.  So as you can see, the stock has done most of its movement in after hours.

Now, I don't want to get conspiracy theory ish.... well yeah I do.  CVNA had a huge volume day on monday.  The kind of volume day that when you see it after a significant move up (its up like 30% in a month), when the rats start running for the exit.  So, I fully expected it to move down.  only, on tuesday, it didn't.  It tried on monday and couldn't, and it tried on tuesday and couldn't (both days have long tails to the downside).  Then it went down in after hours tuesday night.  Tell me that's not manipulation.  They couldn't get it down in regular trading so they took it down when theres no volume.

You see it daily on "low float" stocks as well and there are hundreds of "professional traders" who only short these when they go nuts in premarket.

90% of the time there is no reason for any of this price action other than manipulation.  But I am a naturally trusting person and don't want to accuse anyone of anything.  If I try to reach for a different reason, I know someone will answer "bots".  That could very well be true but again, I think I have made my case that there are bigger players with sizeable positions influencing these stocks, not just momentum bots.

I have 1000 shares riding before earnings and I don't plan to hold long term and here's why:

**1) Going 'digital' and improving their 'e-commerce' presence**

How will this strategy and direction improve their future YOY revenues when the PS/Xbox have their own stores and offer exclusive discounts to members? Why would the average zoomer/boomer/millenial console gamer purchase games exclusively via GameStop? Do people even purchase physical copies anymore nor give a sh\*t about them (limited editions, for noverlty, etc.)?

**2) Okay but XBOX and PS5 CONSOLES = REVENUE!!!!**

Okay but your local Best Buy, Walmart, etc. will also sell the consoles no? GameStop isn't the only exclusive retailer for these consoles and banking on revenues made from console sales is a temporary band-aid fix. What happens to GameStop when console sales flatten out and everyone has a ps5? 

**3) okay but rYaN coHeN,** [**chewy.com**](https://chewy.com) **tho!, and 10% oWnErShiPP!!!**

Bro he bought his 10% shares months back before GME shares were worth $16 like today. He's already made a **PHAT STACK.** And frankly, idgaf if he made chewy profitable. We're not comparing apples to apples if you're basing his success with Chewy with GameStop.
