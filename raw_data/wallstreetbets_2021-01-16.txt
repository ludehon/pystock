 Sony begins testing its electric car concept on public roads. Sony an EV play? Fuck me, I need more margin! _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ I've seen a lot of people be confused about how short % of float can be over 100%. Here is what that means So much fomo happening on this sub a lot of these questions seem to pop up by uneducated traders that don't want to miss out. Hopefully this will make sense and give you a more accurate view of what is happening with so many shorts in this market

Keep in mind I am going to try and keep it simple, so there might be some inaccuracies but the general idea is the same.

Let's say a stocks float is 100MM shares

If the short interest is 150MM shares, that would be a short interest of 150%

A lot of people seem confused about where those extra 50MM shares would come from. What happens when a stock is sold short is it creates a "synthetic" stock for the buyer. The stock is still a real stock, but it was effectively created through the shorting process.

So a good way to see how many actual shares exist, you add the float and short interest together. Essentially, you add the synthetic shares to the float.

In this case, that would be 250MM shares

So once forced to cover, the shorts would be forced to purchase 150MM of the available 250MM shares.

The example I used above is a purely hypothetical example and in no way related to any current equity or stock ticker. All information here is only for educational purposes and is not a recommendation or advice.


🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $FUBO DD - Connecting the dots, this thing is going to be a MONSTER. Pretty sure most of you know $FUBO has been shorted like crazy since the news of their Victory acquisition. It shot up 33% with the news and has since lost most of those gains. I'm here to tell you why the shorts are wrong and why this is a MASSIVE opportunity for us.

First, I'd like to address the issue of profitability. It was founded in 2015and being a young, growing company and isn't profitable yet. To put things into perspective, even Netflix which was founded in 1997 wasn't profitable until 2003. Fubo has more competition today than Netflix did back then, but it's still growing rapidly. 

Q3 Results: [https://www.yahoo.com/now/fubotv-announces-q3-2020-results-210500756.html](https://www.yahoo.com/now/fubotv-announces-q3-2020-results-210500756.html)

* Revenues were $61.2 million, a 47% increase year-over-year on a pro forma basis, or +71% excluding 2019 licensing revenue from the FaceBank AG business, sold in July 2020. This growth was driven by continued subscriber expansion, an increase in subscription Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) and growth of advertising sales:  

   * Subscription revenue increased 64% year-over-year to $53.4 million.
   * Advertising revenue increased 153% year-over-year to $7.5 million.
* Paid subscribers at quarter end totaled 455,000, an increase of 58% year-over-year.
* Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) per month was $67.70, up 14% year-over-year.
* Total content hours streamed by fuboTV users (paid and free trial) in the quarter increased 83% year-over-year to 133.3 million hours.
* Monthly active users (MAUs) watched 121 hours per month on average in the quarter, an increase of 20% year-over-year.

Q4 Preliminary Results:

[https://ir.fubo.tv/news/news-details/2021/fuboTV-Announces-Preliminary-Fourth-Quarter-2020-Revenue-and-Subscriber-Growth/default.aspx](https://ir.fubo.tv/news/news-details/2021/fuboTV-Announces-Preliminary-Fourth-Quarter-2020-Revenue-and-Subscriber-Growth/default.aspx)

* Q4 total revenue is expected to be between $94-$98 million, a 77% to 84% increase year-over-year.\* Prior guidance was $80-$85 million.
* Paid subscribers at year-end are expected to exceed 545,000, an increase of more than 72% year-over-year. Prior guidance was 500,000-510,000 subscribers.

It smashed its previous guidance because sports and normality are returning. Also note that Fubo was still growing rapidly during the pandemic despite the lack of sports which is its primary focus. This is huge and it will continue to grow faster as sports start to return to normal. 

*FUBO* is estimated to announce *earnings* between Jan 25, 2021 and Feb 03, 2021

&#x200B;

Most of us know that Fubo was opportunistically  hit by short sellers (Kerrisdale/Rich Greendfield) as their lock up period expired. This made the stock tank considerably from it's high of $60. The short argument is that integrated sports betting is a pipe dream, and that its not profitable yet. 

As mentioned earlier, it took Netflix a while to scale up and become profitable. At the rate Fubo is growing, they are going to be profitable sooner than later. This isn't even an argument to me, as they scale up a few things will happen:

\- Customer acquisition costs will become a lower and lower percentage of revenue.

\- Since they license their content, they need scale to turn those licensing costs to profit (just like Netflix did)

\- More customers mean they can charge more for advertising. (More on this later)

Fubo very clearly addressed the issue of integrated sports betting with the acquisition of Vigtory. The bear thesis is weakening significantly. Almost nonexistent. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Now, on to the NBA:

[https://www.forbes.com/sites/bethkindig/2021/12/31/fubotv-solid-positioning-for-sports-betting/?sh=5fadb7c69cb5](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bethkindig/2021/12/31/fubotv-solid-positioning-for-sports-betting/?sh=5fadb7c69cb5)

"Over the past few years, Sky Media led investment rounds in FuboTV along with Fox for a 39% stake. This investment round was increased in late 2017/early 2018 with Sky Media holding Board positions. The former NBA commissioner was also part of the last $15 million round. Media has gone through some very big M&A shifts at the top-level with Comcast acquiring Sky and Disney acquiring 21st Century Fox. However, for FuboTV’s formative years, the company was influenced by arguably the top sports betting company in the world – Sky Media from the UK. The Comcast-owned Sky Media is still a backer for FuboTV along with Disney."

David Stern, the late former NBA commissioner was involved in funding of Fubo. The current NBA commissioner Adam Silver worked extremely closely with his mentor. I've been a lifelong NBA fan and I had doubts in Adam Silver but I think he's done a fantastic job with the NBA.

Why am I bringing up the NBA?

[https://www.casino.org/news/nba-considering-betting-broadcasts-could-help-draftkings/](https://www.casino.org/news/nba-considering-betting-broadcasts-could-help-draftkings/) (check the date of this and check the date of the Fubo Vigtory announcement)

People are missing some key elements to the NBA announcement: this announcement was made literally the DAY after the Fubo Victory acquisition. People are missing the link between the NBA and Fubo, let alone the timing. Fact check me, they were announced a day apart and Fubo is the ONLY company with plans of an integrated sports betting broadcast platform. 

The NBA wants to get into this because they know viewers watch games for longer with sports betting and fantasy leagues (which is why I think they threw in DraftKings)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Now, lets look into two key acquisitions: 

\- Vigtory - Fubo acquired them and put their co-founder in charge of integrated sports betting along with their licenses and tech. 

Balto - This one is another thing bears are missing. They claim this acquisition was to get into sports betting, it wasn't this was for their fantasy sports platform which Fubo is also planning on integrating.

&#x200B;

Fubo is going to be an absolute monster going forward. It is trading at a discount thanks to shorts [https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/fubo](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/fubo)

34m shares short, 62.5% of float shorted. This thing is PRIMED for an epic squeeze AND it's valued at a discount right now. 

Since the Vigtory acquisition, new price targets came out ranging from $47 to $60. 

Short term, I'm confident this thing will pop soon. It was hammered down after the Vigtory announcement by shorts, followed by a low volume selloff Friday. It's trading at imo, a massive discount right now.

Long term, this thing is shaping up to be a unique competitor in streaming/sports betting.

&#x200B;

TL;DR - get in long, one way or another. Commons, LEAPS, anything... this thing is going to explode as we inch towards earnings (expected late January to mid-February). We got massive revenue growth, we have strong tailwinds with the return of sports, we have the NBA basically saying they're in as long as Fubo can execute._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Changing RH from a Margin (Default) to a Cash Account. I'm seeing a lot of retards here that think because they've disabled lending, or because they aren't borrowing money, that they're shares won't be lent out. That's not the case. Even if you aren't borrowing money, it's still a margin account if you can use instant deposit or have never heard of "settlements."

Margin (the type of account) and margin (the money they lend you) are different. ..ish.

Margin accounts let you spend your money immediately after closing a trade, where as cash accounts need you to wait 1 day for options or 2 for stock. RH lets you trade immediately even when under 2000 and not in an official margin account, by personally lending you the money. Instant deposits are the same. They can only lend the money if you're on what is typically called, a margin account.

Luckily for you there's still time to fix it and switch to cash:

You can downgrade to a traditional Robinhood cash account by emailing support@robinhood.com with the following:

- Confirmation that you have $0.00 in unsettled funds and no pending transactions. You can view your unsettled funds in the Account section and your pending transactions in the History section of the account menu.

- Your feedback on why you no longer want to use Robinhood Instant.

*Once we have your email, we should be able to downgrade your account within a few business days.*

**TL;DR:** Increase your tendies by emailing support@robinhood.com the following as soon as possible because it takes a few days to go through. The lazy shits can't even properly take our money.

I have looked into investing in SpaceX myself. For small-timers like me (less than $20M investment), the only avenue is a so called special purpose vehicle (SPV), an LLC that in total attracts $20M+ of investment, and is then able to purchase part of SpaceX. Usually, investment minimums are $200-250k, since the max number of investors in an LLC is apparently 100. Unfortunately, the SpaceX SPV's I've found charge outrageous fees. 5% up front, then 2% annually and finally 20% of any profit. That could work for a couple of years, but I think SpaceX is at least a 20 year investment horizon. It may be be the most valuable company in the solar system by then, by some margin, but still.

Other ways to get some SpaceX exposure, which others have mentioned, includes buying GOOG (perhaps 0.5%), and mutual funds BPTIX (3%), or BFGIX (2.6%), which all pretty much sucks._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ BlackBerry does stuff TLDR; If you are here for a lot rockets, here you are 🚀 This post contains info about BlackBerry.

I'm new here, this is my first DD post. Be gentle, retards.

# Intro

Let's start this off by saying this post has no PT, no stock opinion, no predictions on stock movement, it isn't about the stock or the moon. I do own shares, since I like 'em. You don't have to.

This post is about BlackBerry and what they do, since some of the yolo-ers here don't really know what they are buying into. Basically what I have done for you is went to their website, looked at their products and wrote some down. This is far from everything.

# Stuff they no longer do

**Smartphones**

In 2015 BlackBerry made their last smartphone: The BlackBerry Priv. According to a company with the name of a banned ticker that starts with a C and ends with NET (7.6/10) and Techradar (4/5) it was a decent phone. But BlackBerry lost its share in the smartphone sector and made the correct decision to stop.

# Stuff they do

**License their name for smartphones**

Since 2016, TCL made some BlackBerry phones, however they lost the rights to do that in August 2020. In India Optiemus is a BlackBerry licensee for the Indian market. In 2020 OnwardMobility acquired the license to make phones in BlackBerry's name, and they'll release a 5G BlackBerry device with Android and a physical QWERTY keyboard in 2021. (Which I probably will buy with my $BB gainz)

**Software (mostly CyberSecurity)**

You should check out BlackBerry's YouTube channel which contains quite a lot of videos about their products (since y'all can't read that well) [BlackBerry - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLnFGgerRGKlId9uo7dRpIw)

I'm not going to pretend like I understand anything of cybersecurity (stuff with authentication, antivirus, endpoint safety, trust,... if you know you know and if you don't know you probably don't have to). I do know however it's very important to businesses and governments and one of the most important and emerging tech sectors. This goes paired with quite a lot of money spent: its a 123 billion dollar industry \[1\]

Their software isn't limited to cybersecurity, but they do take pride in the fact that each of their software solutions are secure and enterprise-grade. They provide a file sharing application (BlackBerryWorkspaces), a crisis communication system (BlackBerry AtHoc), a BYOD solution (BlackBerry Work), messaging (BlackBerry Connect), ... you see where this is going.

**Automotive**

This actually too is software, but we'll split it up because this one is big.BlackBerry QNX is "a real-time OS plus virtualization, safety and security solutions for tomorrow’s critical embedded systems". Basically it's the software running your car, for which car manufacturers can develop. With cars becoming more and more digital, this becomes more and more important. Here's a video [BlackBerry QNX - The Platform for the Car - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9iggiTTbC8)BlackBerry IVY is "a scalable, cloud-connected software platform that will allow automakers to create personalized driver and passenger experiences and improve operations of connected vehicles with new BlackBerry QNX and AWS technology". Basically this will take cars to a whole new level of customization and connectiveness. Here's another video [BlackBerry IVY - Intelligent Vehicle Data Platform - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwDnUNENSoY)BlackBerry Radar is "a complete asset tracking solution providing reliable visibility to trailer, chassis, containers and equipment." Here's another video [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8dOnzd-Y5M](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8dOnzd-Y5M)

BlackBerry does more than written above. Like a lot of companies. They do stuff.

You should look at their Investor Presentation if I sparked (®)\* any interest, it contains a lot of pictures: [https://www.blackberry.com/content/dam/blackberry-com/Documents/pdf/financial-reports/2021/q3y2021/Q3-FY21-Investor-Presentation.pdf](https://www.blackberry.com/content/dam/blackberry-com/Documents/pdf/financial-reports/2021/q3y2021/Q3-FY21-Investor-Presentation.pdf)

A little background: In addition to Game Stop, I’ve bought General Motors as it has some short term catalysts in 2021 as a recovery play. It sold the most trucks in the US in 2020 and apparently isn’t yet affected by a semiconductor shortage that is forcing Ford to idle some plants, but the real story here is Cruise.

GM owns Cruise, the SF-based autonomous vehicle technology company, that plans to offer autonomous taxi and delivery services. The total addressable market is $5-8 trillion according to the Cruise CEO. 

“Dan Ammann, CEO of the GM majority-owned autonomous vehicle subsidiary, on Wednesday said that valuation includes autonomous ride-hailing services to compete against current companies such as Uber and Lyft at a potentially $5 trillion sector; $2 trillion for freight; and $500 billion each for data insights and in-vehicle experiences.” Source: [CNBC ](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/05/gms-cruise-values-autonomous-vehicle-industry-at-8-trillion.html) 

*Why now?*

1) Cruise had once aimed to launch a commercial service using so-called ‘driverless’ vehicles by the end of 2019 (so they must have thought they were pretty close). Cruise started fully autonomous taxi service in SF in December 2020

2) In January, Cruise hired the former COO of Delta, another pretty strong signal they are getting ready for commercialization.

3) In a recent earnings call, GM CEO indicated they were open to a sale of Cruise which was last valued at $19bn. In this market, if they show any sign of progress, should be $100bn (vs current market cap of GM of $71bn). If GM retains minority control, it’s all upside. [Deutsche Bank analyst who asked the question on earnings call explains](https://youtu.be/12XMATuP3_0)

4) GM crushed it at CES, unveiling a flying drone and new business called BrightDrop, “ecosystem of electric products, software and services to help delivery companies transport goods more efficiently”

*Price Target* 🎯 🌝 

In December, Morgan Stanley’s Adam Jonas raised its price target to $57, USING A DISCOUNT RATE OF 30% to account for execution risk. That’s insanely conservative in my opinion, but hey let’s go with it for a second. Back of the napkin, if the present value is $57/share and the discount rate is 30%, that implies a future value of $420.69 in 7.6186 years. This market has been making moves in dog years and Jonas’s call was made in Dec, so that means we celebrating New Years 2022 in tendie town.

But seriously, I think we are going to $100 this year which Jonas also cited as a “blue sky” bull case. Under that scenario, Cruise is spun off at $100bn valuation.

I’m just sharing my call, not giving advice. Do your own research.

Compass Pathways PLC is a British company studying synthetic psilocybin as a treatment for depression.

**Business Overview**

CMPS is addressing several mental health diseases. There are ongoing trials for anorexia nervosa, addiction (primarily alcohol and smoking), depression, and anxiety. The global TAM for depression and anxiety alone is estimated at $18.5b. The most successful antidepressant at present is Zoloft, and it has generated over $30b in total revenue for Pfizer.

CMPS is the largest of the psychedelic pharmaceutical companies by a significant margin with a market cap of almost $1.53b (only MindMed also breaks $1b). They are also currently listed on the Nasdaq. While psilocybin research has increased significantly, they are the dominant player in this space. They now run all six registered clinical trials for psilocybin that are industry supported.

As with all the players in this space, there are concerns about IP protections and the defensibility of their position. CMPS was granted a patent (US Patent No 10,519,175) in Jan 2020 for the use of psilocybin for treatment-resistant depression. This patent covered their proprietary, synthetic version of psilocybin (called COMP360). The primary purpose of the patent was to protect a stable form of psilocybin for clinical use. Otherwise, you would be stuck with a product with limited shelf life and significant variability in dosing. This patent is significant because it fulfills the FDA’s “good manufacturing practice” standards required to get final approval for any drug.

Phase 1 trials for psilocybin are (by and large) completed. A 25mg one-time dose has been well-tolerated in several trials (in a typical 70kg subject). This has allowed for progression to Phase 2 trials. Clinical efficacy trials are starting to get published. The highest-profile study yet is Davis *et al.* **2020** JAMA Psych, wherein they found significant benefit to psilocybin use in conjunction with therapy when treating depression (trial: NCT03181529) (1).

Comp360 is in Phase 2b trials (NCT03775200 for an initial trial and NCT04519957 for long-term follow up) with a recruitment goal of 216 subjects. The Phase 2b trial is projected to finish recruitment in May 2021 and completed in Dec 2021. Depending on how the data look in May, they could begin working on Phase 3 approval through the FDA shortly after that. The primary question is how large a trial (i.e., how many subjects) will they need for Phase 3? This gets at the efficacy and number needed to treat to see a benefit (number needed to treat/NNT). The closest analog for investigational psychedelics is esketamine (aka Spravato). While ketamine has use as an anesthetic, its use in mental health was controversial (2). There were multiple analyses of the data (3–5), but the most important thing to know is that psilocybin has both a greater and a more durable antidepressant than esketamine (6–8). It stands to reason that the size of their Phase 3 will be smaller than the esketamine/Spravato trial and will proceed more quickly. Regardless, the timeline for that is still on the order of years.

The political climate is improving for psilocybin. Oregon and DC have recently voted to decriminalize it. In contrast with LSD, there is significantly more will to study therapeutic uses of psilocybin, and some reputable US universities (NYU, JHU) are leading these efforts.

Differences from the marijuana industry: An understandable comparison has to be made to the marijuana bubble. There are several key differences between the two markets:

* Higher barrier to entry.
* Lower recreational demand.
* Ability to learn from marijuana stock euphoria.

**Dilution rounds/Convertible debt situation:** CMPS has been through two rounds of funding and an IPO. Series A and B raised $105m in capital (Series B in April 2020), followed by their IPO, which raised $146.6m. They’re backed by ATIA Life Sciences who have raised $125m in November, and ATIA will be going through its own IPO sometime in 2021. Raising funds has not been an issue thus far and will get easier as trials are completed.

Dilution can be a significant hit to share price (ask MindMed holders). Looking through their F-1, on F23 (pg. 305), there are 116,455,234 shares worth of options and convertible preferred shares. There are 94,651,686 shares authorized. The F-1 has a section on dilution, but every pdf version available looks corrupted and there are missing values. Expect that any investment will be diluted at some point if the company is successful.

As a sidebar, Peter Thiel owns 7.54%.

&#x200B;

**Outlook:**

The next major milestone for CMPS will be an interim report on their Phase 2b trial for Comp360. They have been enrolling patients for 12 months now. When looking at the change log on [clinicaltrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov), their initial goal was the complete the trial by Dec 2020, but this slipped to 2021. Their primary completion is now May 2021; this will be when they’ve enrolled all the subjects. There may be some kind of press release at that point or even an announcement of a pre-IND call to the FDA to discuss Phase 3 plans.

My thesis is that the stock will continue to cool off from the ATH they hit in December. A 10q will come out in late February; they could potentially have an update on trial progress in it – there could also be an 8k. They will not disclose interim study results at that time. Their goal will be to wait for a splashy publication after the trial is done. The goal should be entry before then. Prior results are strong enough and consistent enough to have a favorable outlook on the trials.

Longer-term, they will be administering a Phase 3 trial. Look for a recruitment goal of 1,000 or more subjects (it will be on the order of the Spravato/Esketamine trial, which had 816). Janssen Research moved Spravato rapidly through Phase 2 and 3 trials, and it still took them four years to do the entire Phase 3 alone. CMPS has been efficient thus far, but Janssen is a J&J subsidiary with significantly more funding. A full four-year cycle would be a reasonable estimate. But we will get a better idea when the Phase 2 is done since it is already large for a trial of this type. If they can recruit patients quickly, then their Phase 3 may be faster than Janssen’s was for Spravato. CMPS also has the advantage of breakthrough therapy status with the FDA.

An all-important caveat to CMPS: this is a company with only one drug in the pipeline. If Comp360 has a negative trial outcome, then this stock will tank. There is no plan B. Administration of Comp360 is not as simple as getting a prescription and taking it at home. Patients have to be monitored by a specially trained therapist for >4 hours after administration. Even if there are significant benefits over the current therapies, clinical adoption will be slow.

My final TLDR: enter this play in the medium term after the current peak has wound down. CMPS is a better long-term hold that other players in this sector given the patentability of their therapeutic (Comp360) and success moving through trials. The science is on their side, and the political climate is more favorable than other psychedelics (e.g., LSD and MDMA).

Today I went into Gamestop with the intent of browsing around and using a $25 gift card I got for Christmas like a year ago. I have not been inside a physical GME store since at least 2018 when I bought an Xbox. I immediately noticed that they have a much wider variety of merchandise, everything from games to PC hardware to toys and clothing. So on that note I was looking to buy a new PC gaming headset since I noticed they "have" a ton of them. I grabbed one and went to check out. The manager informed me that they don't actually have them in stock or available to order- in fact, most of the items in the store were just display boxes for promotional purposes. I thought this was weird, but she explained that:

**1- They sell in-store items so fast that if they didn't display empty boxes the store would look entirely empty. She gave an example of 200 packs of pokemon cards that sold out completely within 24 hours**

**2- They are reluctant to fill the store with generic items that don't move fast, because that store specifically, among "3-4 others in the state" are going to be totally redesigned to accommodate for what she described to me as "PC building stations".**  🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

**3- They have been absolutely crushing it with sales and store interest due to COVID. She stated that people are buying things that she has never sold before, like niche Wii remotes and other items."**

Now, we have speculated for some time that GME is going to pivot to PC parts and hardware. I noticed that they do stock some PC peripherals and a few components like graphics cards (older models, they had an NVIDIA 1660 in stock) and PSUs. 

HOWEVER, I haven't seen or heard anything regarding a full-on build station. The way she described it to me, is that customers will be able to totally spec out a PC gaming rig, and have it shipped directly to their house. She said there will likely be a dedicated store employee there to assist customers and provide advice. THIS IS FUCKING HUGE. Currently, you have to be pretty "in-the-know" to spec out a gaming PC properly, and the pricing makes it unrealistic for a lot of gamers. On top of that, I think there is a perception that you need a lot more technical skill to get into PC gaming. What GME is doing will allow the PC gaming market to bust wide open and become more accessible for a lot more people. And finally, some sort of agreement or deal with the big manufacturers (as hinted) would make this even more lucrative!

She also said that there is a huge push from upper management for store employees to get knowledgeable on PC gaming and hardware- she said management is pushing hard for the company to step into the future. Meanwhile during the 30 minutes I was in the store, probably 10-15 customers came through and bought at least minor items. Keep in mind this is in a strip mall in a Midwestern rust belt town- certainly does not fit the "Next blockbuster!1!!!" thesis.

Personally I believe this is a very bullish move from Gamestop- and bodes well for the future on top of the other well-established information out there. GME is and continues to be an excellent value play, not even accounting for the upcoming short squeeze. It sounds like the vision from Cohen and others at the top is already filtering down to the people charged with carrying it out. I plan to buy at least 50 more shares on Tuesday.

ETA from one of the commenters below, u/theodros1:

"Oh shiiitt. This is amazing. I called a bunch of my local gamestops and luckily got a very talkative sales guy. He says that Gamestop Stores will be either 1.0 or 1.5 stores. The 1.5 stores will be more "PC oriented" and will allow users to choose parts. He didn't confirm "PC building stations" but dropped an amazing tidbit. The changes started in OCTOBER.... what else happened in October? Ryan fucking Cohen. This is amazing news and hopefully we hear more about it soon in media/press release.

edit: oh shit... I called this other Gamestop and he said the "Cohen news hasn't materialized yet"... I said him being "CEO" and he grunted, I think affirmatively

edit 2: called another gamestop. Overheard them talking about "reset" of stores when I asked which store in area was 1.5

edit 3: Found a 1.5 station, he confirmed OP's post. There will be gamestop stores where we can build out our whole PC in store.

If price shoots up into the mid 50s  🚀🚀🚀🚀 , definitely duck for cover Friday.  Margin changes are actually bearish. Consider being on a brokerage that pays to loan your shares to shorts if long, because it's very profitable. Shorts can be squeezed, but so too can longs who use call options, and shorts who use put options.

Important note: The massive melt-up we had this week was a GAMMA SQUEEZE. Options market makers had to buy about 30m shares (or cover short shares, thanks Melvin Capital, then buy) while going on that run from 20 to 40 to hedge their positions. That as you know is more than half the float. My belief is that gamma effects will continue to be a big deal - but less of a big deal than last week because we have less options near the money now.  **Ironically, Melvin Capital made this melt-up far stronger, contributing 5m shares of forced buying in a rapid spike at $24/$25.**

**Details:**

I’ve seen a lot of discussions about GME over the past week that are missing important bull and bear elements in the thesis. This sub is so incredibly bullish  🚀🚀🚀🚀  that unsurprisingly, there’s more missing bear arguments than bull, and bearish information is sometimes perceived as bullish (such as the margin requirement increases, which I feel are net-bearish). But there's also missing bull information, namely that more new gamma ramps exist high than low it appears, and they appear pretty large.

I previously posted about some option dynamics last week, that seem to have played out to an extent. I actually lost money on my puts because the expressed vol was less than I thought, and Friday ended up playing out in a basically neutral way from a bull/bear perspective with a mere 10% drawdown. That post is here. I correct predicted the outcome, but didn’t predict the magnitude well enough and thus my trade sucked:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kxb7dy/analysis\_of\_massive\_potential\_gme\_forced\_selling/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kxb7dy/analysis_of_massive_potential_gme_forced_selling/)

In this new post, I’ll cover what I know about current option structure (and will update once updated data for Friday comes out), and the implications (TLDR: Mostly, expect vol around multiples of 5 in stock price), as well as other trading dynamic topics that I think are misunderstood or rarely spoken of.

I’m not going to talk about my opinion of the value of the stock or the turn-around plan. I’m actually in what is a modest put position for me at the moment (jan 22 $38 puts x 80), but I fully acknowledge this could go to the moon  🚀🚀🚀🚀  next week and I'll feel like a miniature Melvin capital (though shorting at $38 is a lot smarter than at $17) and probably deserve it in that case.

**Current Option Structure:**

I will update this as new data gets in, but you can see big concentrations of options at 30, 35, 39/40 and 45. There isn’t open interest data for Friday, but volume suggests there are further ramps at 50/55/60, but they are probably smaller than the 39/40 and 30 ramps. Normally, dealers are going to be long calls (from people selling covered calls) and short puts (From people buying protection). On GME I think we all know it’s short calls and short puts, since people are buying tons of calls from them, and also speculating with puts. As such, dealers are extremely short gamma, and that means that prices accelerate from dealer activity greatly. When the stock sells, the dealers have to dump stock (or short it). When the stock goes up, dealers have to buy.  **I believe that the Wednesday melt-up was as much a short squeeze as a gamma squeeze, as the price moved over a bunch of OTM options, forcing dealers to buy as much as a bit more than 1/2 of the total float of the company to hedge! Further evidence of this is that the stock went parabolic but then stopped being parabolic once past the peak option strike available on Wednesday - $40. Without the dealer lift, the rally slowed a lot.** This is why I think it looks as much like gamma squeeze as short squeeze. It’s also why gamma positions this week are important, but they are smaller than what was available going from 20 to 40.

These patterns are most sharp at these large concentrations of strike prices, so the stock can jump from 39 to 41 a lot easier than from 36 to 38 as an example. On average, it’s about $1m of stock bought/sold by dealers per percent change. To put in context, there was a jump Friday where about 250k shares got bought and moved the price 5%. That means that if accurate, dealer activity might have been up to half in that flash.   **We don’t yet have the Friday data, but there was a lot of Friday volume. This amplification may be greater next week. This week had a gamma event on Wednesday, after which there were a ton of ITM WSB calls and OOM Melvin puts that don’t have gamma, and thus the price de-volatilized somewhat. But we may now be in a situation with a lot of near the money options, which means we could see very large gamma squeezes up or down again.**

Here’s the structure, I’ll update once there is Friday OI data available. This chart assumes that calls are positive gamma – they will all be negative gamma in this case, so predict accordingly.

[https://imgur.com/a/czrKy6X](https://imgur.com/a/czrKy6X)

Also worth mentioning is the expirations next week. Here’s the current structure for next week, using Thursday data, which I’ll update once I get Friday data:

[https://imgur.com/a/4wKTspB](https://imgur.com/a/4wKTspB)

This is a lot less bearish than the Friday we just had, but again, I’ll update once I get the data. It’s still a net sell on Friday as those option positions get cleared out (people sell to realize, and then buy other things in general), but more like under 1/10th of float vs the 1/3 of float we were staring at this Friday. Unless people piled into ITM calls Friday, which I find highly unlikely. As such, the downwards force this coming Friday, if this Friday was -10%, is more like -2 or -3% in a vacuum.  However, the higher the prices go into Friday, the more selling this in turn causes Friday, so in a world where we end at $55 on Thursday, I'd definitely not go into Friday long as this forced selling increases.

My sense out of all of this is:

\- The current gamma structure provides more ramps up than down from $35, but there are strong ramps in either direction. BUT, the volume suggests a lot of new put positions were established. On net – volatility up, not bearish or bullish. You could maybe argue very slightly bullish I guess.

\- There is some forced selling this coming Friday, but if that was the driving force yesterday, it would be a -3% or -2% not a -10%.  Slightly bearish. Can change based on price.

\- If the stock moons this week, I would encourage you to approach Friday with care, and a more bearish or defensive mentality, even if fundamentally bullish. Similarly, if we are in the 20s, there are situations where friday eventually becomes forced buying from a ton of short term puts printing, and a bear would not want to be short into Friday.

\- A LOT of capital went into OOM puts and calls this week targeting the week after. If the stock is not volatile, a lot of speculators bleed out on both sides. And those numbers may update my assessments above one way or another.

**Margin Changes**

There was a lot of talk about how various brokerages have increased margin requirements on GME stock. Some set to 100% (Schwab), others set up a bit (TDA from 70% to 75%),  others rumored to be planning but haven’t (IBKR). The reaction of the sub is that this is bullish. It’s actually bearish, albeit slightly.

The reason is that most of the shorts, in my opinion, are institutional. Retail will typically short with OOM puts which don’t cause much actual selling to hedge. Institutions short GME are going to have that in a giant account with a ton of other assets, so changes on margin placed on them, if indeed that happened, wont margin call them except in scenarios where GME goes up 20x in a day or something.

On the other hand, if you are a retail trader where half or all of your positions are GME, this margin change does effect you, especially if you were out on margin, and it makes it harder to buy more shares. I don’t think many retail traders are directly short the stock.  Anyone want to raise their hand and admit they are 50%+ GME and on margin to do it?

Also, consider the context -retail brokerages just did this on the back of everyone here buying shares long. That to me suggests they are looking at customer accounts, seeing some over-extension, worrying about it, and setting the rule to prevent themselves being burned. Some of you have a net worth of mostly GME in your levered account. If that gets squeezed down and a liquidation is forced those brokerages won’t be seeing the money.

So, I think the margin changes are a bit bearish, but not hugely so. I would also urge you bulls to not set yourself up to be squeezed, which is my next point.

**Squeezes and Short Interest**

It’s true that this stock has high short interest. There’s contradictory evidence as to if the shorts went up this week or went down. IBKR share availability suggests it may have went down, other sources suggest up, and I'll update once we have solid post-Friday data that someone posts. However, just because the short interest is high, doesn’t mean that it can be squeezed easily from here – Wednesday I think was that squeeze. A lot of the old shorts may have covered then, and we may be looking at new shorts. It’s also possible that these institutional shorts hedged with previously deep oom call options and ironically further helped create the melt up, but didn’t take losses after a certain point. It is worth noting though that MMs engaging in 30m shares of buying (Some of which was short covering) only doubled the stock - and they are now long stock and will loan it out to short sellers all day.

Additionally, while GME longs here on stock are not squeezable if not on margin, those of you on OOM call options ARE squeezable, and those of you on ITM options are in a sense even more squeezable. OOM call options decay if the stock doesn’t go up, and then the shares dealers bought to hedge the call they sold you get sold back into the pool. ITM options, when sold, do the same but more powerfully – selling a very ITM call option on GME means a dealer immediately goes out and dumps 100 shares of GME on the market. If you in turn buy 100 shares, it’s netural, or if you buy a bunch of NTM calls, you might even cause a net buy. But, those will tend to cause selling if people take money off the table and as time goes on.

And yes, there are a TON of new put options, and those get squeezed out too.

So there is a dual squeeze potential here – shorts vs their losses and borrow fees and decaying option positions which cause dealer buying, and longs using margin and longs in call options fighting time and also watching dealers dump their hedged longs.

One other thing -  contrary to what I sometimes read, Melvin Capital was already squeezed, or rather, their dealer was by proxy.  Wednesday was that squeeze. They bought a bunch of ITM put options which forced dealers to sell a ton of stock to hedge. When the price shot up, dealers bought into that short they made to hedge the Melvin puts, and now the Melvin puts expired worthless. Melvin can not be squeezed further unless they enter a new short position of some type. They lost 55M on that trade, and they manage 20 billion. They may be back in it at this point, shorting this even harder is within their power...

Lastly, it has been brought up that some of the GME short, especially those puts lurking at $2 and $1, are hedges by bond holders against bankruptcy, or are hedges by those who sold CDS to bond holders to hedge their short CDS. Those are going to keep accumulating because bankruptcy is possible (though unlikely) in the few year range, and getting those puts now is basically free. But they won't affect the price since they are so far OOM.

**Uptick Rule**

Because the stock was down a lot Friday the uptick rule was triggered until eod Tuesday. That means shorts can’t sell at the bid to force down price they can only sell at the ask. In practice this won’t matter a ton since you can still buy puts to make a dealer do this, and my understanding is they aren’t subject to that rule anyway. EDIT - dealers do have to obey this but appear to be net long the stock currently so would not be affected. I thus feel this is very slightly bullish.

**Yield Enhancement Program**

A pro tip I have for this sub is – if you intend to hold a ton of long stock that is in high demand by short sellers, you should get paid to lend it to short sellers. That’s how the option dealers make a lot of their money – I’m sure citadel is making a killing holding a ton of GME stock to hedge, and promptly lending it to hedge funds at 30% borrow rate, while having very little risk.

Many brokerages don’t pay you for lending your shares out, but IBKR does. Right now, if your GME shares are loaned out, you get something like 15% annualized in rebates. WeBull, Fidelity and Schwaab also will do this, but I've not used their programs, and you probably have to ask them to sign up. This doesn’t work if the shares are in margin, they have be fully paid and settled, but it is a substantial extra if you are a long-term believer in the stock, and on other brokerages, they get paid instead of you.  If any other brokerages have this feature that are non-institutional, please post and I’ll add.

It is worth saying that you reduce the cost to short if you do this. I always allow it on my account though because I like the money more and think I’ll beat the shorts eventually anyway. Some money managers never do it so as to not fuel the shorts. But it does pay.

**A Few Other Thoughts on Shorts**

Institutions do sometimes hedge large short positions. It is possible that some of the calls held on Wednesday that caused the giant explosion up were hedges for short positions held by hedge funds/family offices and others.  The fact we didn't see a lot of selling Friday suggests that at least the near the money ones were mostly NOT held as hedges, otherwise they would've been more monetized. But, it's possible that the short pain is less than thought. We just don't know.

**Conclusion:**

I think the major factor here remains simply the desire of this sub to pile new money in. However, it’s hard to maintain this volatility level and ever higher prices for more than a few weeks without additional catalysts because options are getting pricey and decay will set in, and the higher the price, the more money is required to buy a share.

\- The margin changes, again, are definitely bearish. How bearish? That depends on how many of you guys bought a ton of GME shares on margin and whether or not we gap down Tuesday. I don't think it affects the short interest much.

\- The option situation is probably net bullish Tuesday/Wednesday/Thursday, but net bearish Friday (slightly)… but does mean that next week can be insanely volatile

\- Price moves are easier in the vicinity of $35, $30, $39, $40, and to a lesser extent, $45, $50, $55, $60 due to gamma 'ramps'.

\- I’ll post new data when I get it. It could change the picture to be more clearly bearish or bullish, not just volatile. I'll try to lay out estimates of how many shares MM hold, and then updated gamma ramps, as well as expected MM position holdings at various price levels at the end of the week. 

&#x200B;_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Updated Potential Holdings of GME Hello Fellas, due to the monumental rally of GME this week followed quickly by another long weekend, I've been stuck with too much time on my hands and absolute crack energy flowing through my veins. To capitalize on these factors I've decided to create an updated estimate on the holdings of GME. 🚀

As seen in this post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kwb827/gme_endgame_dtc_infinity/?ref=share&amp;amp;amp;ref_source=link), there are a substantial amount of shares that are not for sale. I have added to it with additional holders who may be unlikely to paper hand.

Holding | Percent of Total
:--|:--
Cohen and other Board Insiders | ~19%
FMR LLC | 13.67%
BlackRock | 12.33%
Vanguard| 7.58%
Senvest | 4.62%
Permit | 2.8%

These are holders from the previous post, and I skimmed 0.26% of Cohen and board insiders (i.e. Sherman, James bell, etc.) due to the small recent sell-off of the outgoing directors, just as a rough estimate.

I also want to direct attention to these additional holders that may not sell easily:

Holding | Percent of Total
:--|:--
Dr. Michael J Burry | 2.44%
WSB Gigachads | ~6%

Burry's holdings were taken from [here](https://fintel.io/i/scion-asset-management-llc), 1.7 million shares as of 9/30/20.

WSB estimated holdings were taken from [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k6jjm3/wsb_owns_58_of_gme_gme_survey_update/?ref=share&amp;amp;amp;ref_source=link)

Now Burry's holdings are outdated so take it with a grain of salt, but I doubt he trimmed most of his position before even busting the shorts. The WSB figure is an estimate and also outdated, and doesn't necessarily separate Gigachad Diamond Handers from Paper Handed Scrubs but it is a solid benchmark.

This brings the total to 68.44% of GME shares fairly secure in our mighty grasp, equating to ~47.7 million shares. Now, if you want to take in to account that GME sentiment has been absolutely skyrocketing here recently, you could place WSB holdings at 8% bringing us to 70.44% and 49.1 million shares. At a plausible stretch of 10% we would be at 72.44% and 50.5 million shares. This of course is not counting any other potential retail gigachads that could be found elsewhere such as those speds at stocktwits etc. I also wouldn’t discount the possibility that we hold more than 10%, you guys have seriously been wildin.

That means there could be anywhere from only 22 million shares to 19.2 million shares unsecured. To add to this, we have seen recent posts stating that shares shorted have actually INCREASED from the previous estimate to [79.52 million](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ky4xmk/gme_shorts_havent_covered_theyve_added_only_added/?ref=share&amp;amp;amp;ref_source=link), giving a possible short to float (79.52 shares short/19.2 mill shares available) of ~400% depending on WSB estimates.

It gets better. I know were all hoping for a big day on Tuesday, and of course we would need big news for that to happen right? I mean look at the VW squeeze, over the weekend Porsche released a statement that they had upwards of 70% of the shares and that catalyzed the squeeze. What do we have that could set this off?

Ryan FUCKING Cohen. The legend still has 7% worth of dry powder sitting around and if he releases an increase in his holdings it could end this for the bears. A 7% increase would bring us to anywhere from 75.44% secured (lowest WSB estimate) to 79.44% secured (Highest WSB estimate), that would be a 550% short to float with only 14.3 million shares available. What are the chances he does that though right? Its not like hes an activist investor ;)

In short, bears are fuk and hold the fuckin line you autists the ball is literally in our court. Ill add rockets later.

This is obviously not financial advice, I’m as retarded as you guys but also a little autistic 

TLDR: The mechanisms that drive a short squeeze have shifted further in our favor. We now have more shares shorted and less shares available. If this continues the squeeze will be more violent.

WSB could own as much as 10% or more of GME shares, it goes without saying but paperhanding is the only thing that can hold us back.

All bullish indicators. Squeeze to 900 EOW plus retail pump. _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ On GME and what to expect Tues/Wed (DD) Hi everyone,

I'm going to use this space to say what I would expect Tues/Wed regarding GME (obviously not an expert).

# First some facts:

1) There was an obscene amount of shorts of GME before it went up last week (138%+ of float). There is now still an EVEN MORE obscene amount of shorts of GME (120-170% of float as high-quality estimates).

2) There has been over a month of likely "naked short selling." Aka, ILLEGAL market manipulation (Sells of unconfirmed shares that then end up not going through) in an attempt to further drive down price (27 days on NYSE Threshold securities list, since Dec 8th).

3) Fees to borrow GME have gone up significantly (sitting around 30% atm) and required margins have increased at brokers (75% for Fidelity, 100% for Schwab). This means those brokers are less confident in it going down, and that there are less available shares floating around (lower volumes).

4) Friday, there was a huge early shorting of the stock (the rapid 10% drop) that led to Rule 201 being invoked (stock can only be shorted on an uptick until EOD Tuesday). How do I know it was likely shorting? Because the drop stopped as soon as the Rule was invoked.

# From these facts, what are conclusions I have drawn?

1) Investors (firms or otherwise) who have shorted GME are **repeatedly doubling down**. Big players are doing so to directly (and sometimes illegally, see naked short selling above) manipulate the market in a downward direction. **They have been working on this for months, making the stock undervalued by far,  which is why short volume has been so high, and are continuing to manipulate this stock downward in an attempt to make those earlier shorts less of a failure.**

2) They believe the current price increase will not be sustained or, more like IMHO, that they can out-short any increase that is sustained, so they are paying increasing fees on those shorts every day until the price drops enough (and it needs to drop A LOT for their earlier shorts).

# So what do I think will happen Tues/Wed?

**1) On Tuesday, SEC Rule 201 is still in effect. That means that short sellers can only sell shorts on "upticks" (aka, they can only short at prices above the current market price). I expect that those short sellers will continue to double down, so we may see a price ceiling come into effect. Every time the price increases, the shorting can happen so they'll short it. I expect volume will be relatively low, and the price will not move very far.**

**2) On Wednesday, SEC Rule 201 is not in effect yet. If price moves significantly upwards on Tues, I would almost definitely expect an early short on Wednesday in an attempt to drive small profit selling and further drop the price. If price moves significantly downward on Tues, I would expect the same early shorting in an attempt to induce panic selling. Finally, if price doesn't move much on Tuesday, its much more of a toss-up on their strategy, but I would (personally) anticipate another attempt to short sell the price down as we saw Friday (deep pockets of shorters, already in very deep on shorts).**

**TL;DR: I think shorters gonna keep shorting (legally and illegally) so everyone should be prepared for that. They think the risks of losing older shorts outweighs the risks of additional shorting/the fees of new/old shorts. They've done this level of consistent, repetitive shorting/market manipulation before and have only paid for it a handful of times.**

Just sharing my opinion of what happens next. I'm not here to convince anyone to do anything.

GME 266 at 36.54_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Possible Exit Strategy for GME Shorts? So this actually happened in my dream today but I was wondering if this could be possible.

As of now, if the shorts have not covered during the last three days, we're looking at around 1.2:1 ratio of short to float. and some people were saying short interest is like 250% because of institutional buying or something idk I'm too retarded to understand.

Anyway, in my dream, one of the institutions that bought a lot of shares during the last 3 days, offered a short-exit package for a ridiculous but a very favorable price to all the shorts wanting to cover. This was done in the dark pool so the stock price did not change at all and the shorts who purchased these packages got out safely while the institutions made lots of money. 

It was a win-win situation for both because the institution did not have to worry about missing the timing to sell during the short squeeze and shorts were able to cover without frantically looking for shares to buy. 

I don't know enough to know if this is legal or this is even possible but in my head this seemed like a possibility so I'm posting here to get more insights._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Hit the shorts and we'll fly right by 🚀 _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Steel company ArcelorMittal (MT) is a steal! HRC steel index hits all time high. [Source](https://www.amm.com/Article/3970637/HRC-index-hits-all-time-high-of-58cwt.html)

> "Hot-rolled coil prices in the United States have reached their highest level in at least 60 years"

> "The current index has blown past the previous high-water mark of $56.25 per cwt logged in May 2008. The price now stands at its highest level ever recorded since Fastmarkets started covering this segment of the domestic steel market in 1960."

> “Service center inventories are not good at all, honestly. Everyone in the South is calling each other trying to spot buy coils - every day,” a consumer source said. “I’m feeling we may not reach the top till April, May now. Demand is so strong. [We] need more supply, and relief isn’t coming anytime soon.”

Why is this important, and how can you make tendies? I believe there have been several posts in the past two weeks that share my bullish outlook on $MT, but this recent news is a fantastic boost. You can leverage rising prices in the steel market with upcoming infrastructure expansion announcements next month. I think both monthlies and leaps have a great opportunity here.

All things related to steel manufacturing are in a fight to source material, and they're doing so at record high costs. The largest source, with the capability to deliver domestically and abroad, is ArcelorMittal ($MT). They own and operate steel manufacturing and mining facilities in Europe, North and South America, Asia, and Africa.

In addition to the existing high demand, the Biden administration is releasing a massive [infrastructure plan](https://www.enr.com/articles/50998-biden-unveils-rescue-plan-promises-infrastructure-proposal-next-month) next month.

> "The president-elect said proposals would “make historic investments in infrastructure".

$MT currently trades at $24, but has price targets [as high as $39](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/MT/research-ratings).

I currently have two positions,

**1. 50x 19 Mar 2021 $25C**

**2. 25x 21 Jan 2022 $25C**

I will be adding to my March positions on Tuesday.

**TL:DR;** Steel prices are high, and going higher based on breaking news. $MT is the largest and best source for steel, with a share price that is trending up. Steel is a major component in building rocket ships. Rocket ships go to Mars.

**Edit:** Someone asked that I include [earnings data for Tata Steel](https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/tata-arm-show-hints-at-sunny-days-in-steel/cid/1803856), which is recent, and a good indicator of the steel industry.

Short-squeezes and the importance of 💎👐 # TL;DR in the middle (important edits at the bottom)

Long-time lurker here, finally starting to post with the imminent GME squeeze

Thought it would be helpful to give a VERY BRIEF, slightly more serious explanation on the current situation to the influx of new members:

&#x200B;

Before we start, here's a nice little glossary of autistic terms used around here:

🚀  = stock gonna go up

💎🙌 = holding onto a stock like a god

📝👐 = selling like a loser

&#x200B;

So, currently Gamestop (GME) is on a pretty inevitable short-squeeze path, what does that mean? It means it's about to do something like this:

&#x200B;

[fuckin ridiculous am i right, a more recent example would be tesla \(TSLA\) if you think this is old boomer shit](https://i.redd.it/frjx9fil1qb61.gif)

Now the mechanics of it why short squeezes happen are a little complicated for beginners but here are some threads and other links explaining them IF you want to learn more:

[WSB Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kwb827/gme_endgame_dtc_infinity/)

[Boring Boomer website explanation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortsqueeze.asp)

There also a lot of other factors at play here, but go search that on your own, there's tons of good threads here on WSB

AND if you're really serious about it, ACTUALLY RESEARCH GAMESTOP, its annual revenue, market cap, stocks in general, but lmao none of y'all gonna do that so:

So should you buy GME stock asap?

Do you like free money? Fuck yeah buy that shit 💸💸💸

&#x200B;

HOWEVER here are some VERY IMPORTANT things you should be mindful of in these upcoming weeks:

* The very tippy top of Short-squeezes last fairly long, in the picture above (Volkswagen) it shot up and stayed there for a whole day (at around $600, it did spike at a crazy $1000 for a couple hours though), SLOWLY coming back down over a few days, then finally dropping. THIS MEANS this isn't some minute-by-minute play here, you have some time, just make sure you are prepared.
* In these coming days (or maybe weeks) GME price will waver up and down as the big corporations (Melvin 👿) start trying to cover their asses until eventually it will start spiking like crazy, the Short-squeeze will have started
* Some shit might go down this TUESDAY, it might not, but some shit will ***definitely*** go down within the next week or so as corporations are losing big amounts of money as time goes by
* THE LONGER PEOPLE HOLD 💎🙌 ONTO THEIR STOCKS, THE HIGHER CORPS LIKE MELVIN WILL HAVE TO PAY FOR THEM, this brings me to my next and final point

&#x200B;

# The importance of holding 💎🙌

The price of GME will most likely STAIRCASE upwards (going UP then down then UP, etc), as corps begin to short, people with 📝👐 (pussies) will begin to sell because of the "profit" they're making

Not only will you regret it when the squeeze hits its peak, but you are letting the shorters get off easy by giving them cheap stocks

Imagine this:

you bought GME at $35, it goes up to $100, you panic sell cuz holy shit thats profit, you check again in an hour and see that GME is now $200 because of the many godlike 💎🙌 we have in this sub, then you start crying because not only did you hurt the cause, you missed out on a shit ton more money

***This is the importance of holding 💎***🙌

&#x200B;

Also if you read the DD (basically theory on future prospects) on Gamestop, you'll realize that it actually does have a pretty bright future, so while this may be a pump and dump for many, **I'm sure this stock will actually reach quite a large number in the not so distant future** (just google Ryan Cohen)

* My current estimation for the price target is:
* It will ***definitely*** hit $100 within the next week
* It will probably spike to around $200-$300 for a day or two
* It has a small chance of going fucking nuclear and going past $300   🚀   🚀   🚀  (small chance but definitely possible)
* ***It of course, also has a chance of doing absolutely fucking nothing***

Now, I didn't want to speak boomer but this is important as this subreddit is quite literally an addiction for a lot of people, DON'T PUT MONEY IN THIS STOCK IF YOU'RE NOT COMFORTABLE, WE'RE LITERALLY A BUNCH OF RETARDS (sometimes smart retards)

THIS IS NOT FINANACIAL ADVICE AND IF YOU LISTEN TO ME OR ANYONE ELSE ON THIS SUBREDDIT YOU ARE ALSO RETARDED LIKE ALL OF US

This squeeze is most likely NOT (fully) caused by us, (assuming we're around 10% of the shares) but I mean, 10% is quite a big number so we do have a little control.

&#x200B;

# TL;DR:

# THE MORE OF US THAT HOLD 💎🙌 THE HIGHER GME WILL🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀

# IT MIGHT BE A ROUGH FEW DAYS OR WEEKS BUT DO NOT WAVER, HOLD💎🙌 AND YOU WILL BE REWARDED, SELL📝👐 AND YOU'LL FOREVER GET LAUGHED AT BY EVERYONE HERE LMAO

&#x200B;

thank you for coming to my ted talk, and yes i do have many shares

&#x200B;

**edit:** Adding a few notes here since I've already gotten so many questions lmao:

* Do NOT buy stocks with leverage/margin, as corporations can basically borrow those, aka those stocks aren't yours (as I understand it) Also stocks are better for the squeeze than options, so please try to buy stocks
* What to do if it GME plummets? You can do whatever you want to do, however I'll tell you my personal plan: I have quite a bit of money in this but I would have NEVER put it in if I didn't believe in the long term, so if this squeeze ends up being more of a pinch (very small chance), I'm not selling shit 💎🙌 Again, refer to the DD and Ryan Cohens personal letter, this shit has the potential to grow 3-5x within a few or even this year
* If you ever think about wavering and think "ooh man i'm really playing with big money i should sell 📝👐" think about all the other people in here backing this shit up. We have hundreds of daily YOLO threads of people dumping money in this, hell /u/deepfuckingvalue our [god](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kxeq23/gme_yolo_update_jan_14_2021/) LITERALLY has like 8 million dollars riding on this shit, so learn from him and 💎🙌 my brothers
* Again... if you're concerned or uncomfortable, do your own research, and come to your own conclusions. Don't take advice from retards if you don't want too

&#x200B;

**EDIT 2: DD BOOGALOO:**

If the sheer amount of autism wasn't enough to sell you on GME, here are some pretty boomer, but very important links that go into detail:

[**Gamestop's very own 2020 Holiday Sale Report**](https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-reports-2020-holiday-sales-results)

Important thing to take away here:

"**E-Commerce sales**, which are included in comparable store sales, rose **309%** and represented approximately **34% of total company sales**, with total worldwide E-Commerce sales year to date reaching over **$1.35 billion, far exceeding the Company’s $1.0 billion growth objective**"

This is obviously important as Cohen is most definitely pushing for bigger online presence with GME in the future, and uh yeah just the fact that it's up by *that much* is uh... 🚀🚀🚀

These two boys **made HSR filings + a request for early termination** (that was granted). For those of you who don't know what this means:

HSR filings are required (amongst a couple of other requirements) when someone is making an acquisition of >$94m (this is the rate for the past year in 2020. will likely hike somewhere to \~$100m in 2021). This is what we saw with Mithril when they bought a fuck ton of shares in December ([https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/premerger-notification-program/early-termination-notices/20210675](https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/premerger-notification-program/early-termination-notices/20210675))

**Early termination requests are made to bypass the customary 30-day waiting period when someone makes an HSR filing.** This implies that the individual wants to make a purchase in less than 30 days. Both of the early termination requests were granted. Karpy and Cohen are either buying leading up to demo day/the assumed (HOPEFULLY) price hike we see, or, maybe, right around lockup expy time.

Let me propose an idea. 

Now I know most you cannot read so I’ll post the TL;DR NOW to try and capture the last few seconds of your attention speed. 

TL;DR  > Pinned post, Voluntary charitable donation discussion. 


 Now listen up all, this week has been absolutely incredible for some of you, and most of you must be juiced up to the tits in the most delicious tenderloins any human could ever taste. 
And this must be Extra juicy during the pandemic, this means more freedom, a chance to come out of this current phenomena not being a wage slave 9-5 pre-boomer ( boomers aren’t born, they’re made )

But remember, not everyone is having chicken tenders for dinner tonight my friends, the pandemic has stricken down the lives of many individuals, and the feeling of hopelessness during a time of uncertainty not only happens to the individual but to the us as a whole. It’s almost just like what has happened recently with $GME and Melvin capital. But instead of an institutional investor shorting a stock, it’s a situation that is shorting the people, other humans, people just like you and me. 

So how about instead of all the fucking bullshit posts saying

 “LOL WHAT IF WE ALL COLLECTIVELY ORGANISED TO PUT HEAPS OF $$$$ IN A SINGLE TICKER AND MOON IT TOGETHER BOYS ? WELL ORGANISE THIS ALL ON A PUBLIC FUCKING WEBSITE THAT ANYONE CAN ACCESS 

IT LITERALLY CANNOT GO TITS UP “ 

which gives the place a bad name and is a one way ticket to getting this sub erased from the internet. 

Why don’t we replace it with a pinned post for those who would like to volunteer to donate charities ? 

It’s similar to market manipulation, but instead of a bunch of over excited basement dwellers high on adderal trying to attempt a pump and dump, how about just dump our collective money into one charity ? Albeit a small amount each, how ever much you fucking want be it $1 or $10000

I love you guys who are constantly posting your donations and don’t get me wrong this is doing a big difference and is helps so much, but , as most of all know, the difference between $500 dollars and $100 000 dollars is life changing for some people. 

Imagine what good we could do with our collective autism ?!?!

Instead of giving ourselves a bad name let’s start showing people we can do good, remember retards, we are on the big screen now. 

For those of you who still don’t understand 

We all vote one charity or just discuss a charity in the comments, then on a specific day everyone donates at once. This injects an incredible amount of money into a single charity or organisation that can help on a much larger scale. 

Think of it like you are investing in human kind, as a human being, do you want to see you’re own species get shorted to bankruptcy ? Or do you wan pump the human race into interstellar space ? 

Because that’s how we get there, TOGETHER. 


Have a good long weekend everyone, may your positions 🚀🚀 and your brains remain smooth.  

Good luck and Godspeed!!!

Forgive me for selling some CCs but the premium and 60 strike for 22/01 was too tempting. Expecting not to get assigned on these.

Diamond handing for now and will start to trim 1500 shares a day at any price above $65. If you sell below $60-80 you're going to be leaving a lot on the table.

Some of these pump posts are getting a bit to cringe for my liking....but the thesis still stands - buy and hold shares and you will be rewarded. The company has the potential to reach a $6-8B valuation with ease if RC's turnaround plan is well received.

The Dunning-Kruger Effect is a cognitive bias in which people with a low ability of a given task are prone to overestimate their ability at that task. We are incapable of objective evaluation of our own competency levels. I'm writing about it as I've come to realise I suffer from it.

Dunning and Kruger's main finding from their 1999 study “Unskilled and Unaware of it” was that the worst performers consistently overestimate their ability relative to others.

I've outlined two examples of this bias in action and how you can avoid some of these pitfalls:

1. Investing

As the age old saying goes, "Everyone is a genius in a bull market."

When your portfolio is growing and the markets are ripping as they have in 2020, many fall victim to the Dunning-Kruger Effect. We tend to wrongly attribute this performance to our ability as talented investors.

2. Politics

An obvious example people have been using recently is Donald Trump, whose confidence never wavers, despite his weak interest and understanding of policy matters.

The first rule of the Dunning-Kruger club is you don't know you're a member of the Dunning-Kruger club. But we're all human, and it's important to recognise that we are all prone to this cognitive bias.

Here are a few strategies to avoid it:

1. Identify your circle of competence

The circle of competence is a sacred place. It's a set of topics or areas that align with a person's expertise. Be ruthless in identifying and protecting the boundaries, and it's usually smaller than you think.

As Charlie Munger said, "It is remarkable how much long-term advantage people like us have gotten by trying to be consistently not stupid, instead of being very intelligent."

Know your competencies, focus on them. Know your incompetencies, avoid or outsource them.

2. Be a first principles thinker

A first principle is a foundational assumption or proposition - it is foundational in that it cannot be deduced from other assumptions. In chemistry, it's like an element. It cannot be broken down further.

Ground yourself in foundational truths and build up from there. Challenge your reasoning, and most importantly, always ask why.

"It isn't what you don't know that gets you in trouble. It's what you know for sure that just isn't so."

After a lukewarm success though modest gain this week, next week looks to be a major week for Tesla.

Recently Tesla had released **it's own converter which was primary a market controlled by SEDG and ENPH**:

In addition analysts have raised Teslas top price goal to be **above $1200**:

[https://auto.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/passenger-vehicle/cars/tesla-shares-worth-1250-in-top-scenario-analyst/80296697](https://auto.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/passenger-vehicle/cars/tesla-shares-worth-1250-in-top-scenario-analyst/80296697)

These two events mean that **TESLA is about to explode next week**. I suspect that by Friday we are looking at maybe as high as $1300 which will result in a second stock split most likely and we will then see Tesla rise from $300 to just under $500 before the run actually ends. Although don't expect Tesla to reach $1000 again for at least another year after that.

While the gloves are hot, Diamond gloves makes it so you don't feel that you have to drop the burning TESLA cash. Do not trade them for paper gloves, for while you won't feel the heat as much the fire will burn that paper, and then you.

“JuST mAkE a NeW acCoUnT” 

Stfu reet

I’ll probably delete this as well soon but I know some of you autistic bastards need to hear this now, yes you, who put market orders first thing Friday morning expecting $BB to rocket from high 10’s to 15’s in a single trading session. Pure majestic autism. 

I come out of Plato’s cave to tell you I understand your pains. I was there not too long ago... you see... 

Back in November I noticed $BB cleanly up-trending on the hourly bouncing off the 9 and 26 MA (I use ichimoku) heading towards a resistance level that had already formed a double top 

Like a true Gamblers fallacy believing retard I made a wager: 

$10k into 3/19 6c’s on the DD that: “what are the chances it falls AGAIN there” ... that’s it. 

A few days later AWS news came, and that $10k turned into $70k. Pure luck. Sometimes she goes, sometimes she doesn’t. She went that day.

In that moment of seeing massive profits on AWS news day, I experienced violent and absolutely tremendous autism and thought, this thing is going from $5’s to $15 in a single trading session, yes, even more retarded than you guys that bought the top on Friday 

Sensible thoughts couldn’t penetrate my helmet fast enough as drool gushed from my gaping mouth, gasping for oxygen and yelling at the top of my lungs what barely resembled words about Lambo’s and Yachts... so I hurled about $100k into shares at $8.77 and about $10k more into $15 leaps 

I proceeded to watch my profit dwindle to nothing as earnings came and bent me over so hard I couldn’t bring myself to watch the stock for a week 

I thought about selling the bottom, I was there, order ready typed, just needed to hit the send button, and I was going to close my position around $6.7ish and be back to break even after striking gold 

But you know what, I remembered it’s just money. I remembered that everything in reality is in flux, and changing, and decaying, and being born again, and to just flow with it and stop clinging and desiring one set of experiences over another (aka a fat bank account over giving $5 blowies behind a Wendy’s) who cares? 

All is well lads. So let go of the burden if you bought the top and are stressing, it’s really fine. Look at what’s happening right now:

1) Insane volume, insane moves, erratic behavior (something is going on behind the curtain) 

PS: this movement and volume is NOT because of WSB, full stop. Big players are making huge moves here, and fast, we don’t know why yet 

2) 1 Billion annual revenue 

3) Soon to come online a RECURRING AUTO DATA business that will drive revenue into growth cycle, BB is literally Microsoft Windows for cars but the auto sector was still underdeveloped technologically to benefit from this position, hence this vertical is finally about to print HUGE HUGE HUGE MEGA BILLIONS ANNUALLY. This was always the plan and they just had to wait it out until the auto sector caught up with them digitally 

(The auto data tech sector is so lucrative it made Papa Elon the richest person in the world, and forced a fucking god damn phone company to join the race 🍎—it’s huge)

4) UNDER, FUCKING, VALUED 

5) VERTICALS GALORE

5) FB settled, imagine the BALLS on BB going after this massive and dirty tech behemoth run by a literal lizard, they are honest Canadians doing God’s work 

6) IOT, AI, smart city’s, insert other buzzwords 

I could go on and on, and honestly, I’ve never felt more comfortable holding ANY stock than this 

Moral of the story: as I let go and accepted my circumstances and decided to diamond hand 💎 🤚 BB to the death, within a few days I proceeded to watch the fattest, thickest, randomest, greenest dildo penetrate my butt hole to the high heavens and take me from what was $70k profit to 0 profit back up to $130k profit. I’ve trimmed half the options, I don’t even know why tbh, reverse autism maybe, but I’m riding my remaining calls and entire share position to Valhalla. 

Will likely add more if it dips. But...

Just hold. Something is cooking on BB. You have to be a retard not to see it. Look at the fucking daily chart, look at the volume, the gaps, the swings, BB chart literally has Tourette’s syndrome right now... 

This stock has not moved like this for 10 years. 

It might stall a little, deflate from here, consolidate a bit more, or it might blast off again any second. Point is, nobody knows when, but it looks like in a short time, we will know why this stock is moving the way it has. Something is DEFINITELY going on behind the scenes the public is not aware of and neither is the media 

For fucks sake I found the court docs showing global settlement with FB is done 24 hours before gay ass Bloomberg even picked it up. The majority of the investor world still thinks they make fucking phones for Gods sake. Everyone is sleeping on this 

A note on Jim just in case he reads this:

Jim Cramer hates this stock because 1) BB and John Chen are not bootlicking CEO’s jerking off CNBC and massaging Cramers asshole for air time, they’re a tightly run, honorable company doing real things 2) He most likely became a bag holder during the epic fall of the BB phone and sold for a fat loss and wants to protect his ego by continuing to ignore the facts on the company

The guy wants you to invest in CRWD with a fucking ridiculous market cap, no verticals, and less revenue than BB. Promoting a literal bubble over a value play. What a bizarre world we live in. Take advantage of it, I hear this phrase all the time and I fucking hate it, but this is literally “free money” 

Know what you own. There is TRUE value in this company. No hype. Pure value. 

Diamond hand, double down, buy more, and just hold. You are in good hands 🙌

Tl;dr diamond hand $BB_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Smart money is selling at the fastest pace since 2007 Hey guys, here is a weekly summary of charts and data that I personally looked at and thought was important. Give it a read and let me know what you think! 

Small speculative markets continue to explode higher while large cap markets rally less.

### Summary

Here’s how I approach markets based on 3 different strategies & time frames.

1. **Short term trend followers should continue to ride the rally because no one knows exactly when it will end**. If you are a short term trend follower, you **must** use stops.
2. Medium term contrarian traders should go neither long nor short. Wait. Risk:reward doesn’t favor long positions right now, while shorting into a speculative rally can end in disaster.
3. Long term investors should be highly defensive right now. This speculative bull market may last another 6 months or even 9 months, but in 2 years time, long term investors will be glad they did not buy today.

Bottomline: trend is up, but beware of mounting risks.

&#x200B;

Let’s keep our mind open to different outcomes by looking at both bullish and bearish factors.

### Who is buying?

A day can’t go by without another multi-billion dollar IPO exploding higher. But while traders and investors are buying small & speculative stocks like there’s no tomorrow, **almost no** **corporate insiders** **are buying their own stocks anymore**. The corporate insider sell/buy ratio’s 50 day average is at the 2nd highest level ever. It was only exceeded by 2007:

https://preview.redd.it/fyas2rmoepb61.png?width=651&format=png&auto=webp&s=97e6546cabba2929e20918aea1b1fa5f5aa8fc11

In 2007, stocks rallied for another half year before an epic collapse began. This isn’t to say that “today is just like 2007”. The future is never just like the past. But even if we look at less extreme historical cases, the next 3-6 months saw mediocre returns for stocks:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/za7o2nkpepb61.png?width=643&format=png&auto=webp&s=b842ef7978be9ad8281cc7df8311c96a4feed6f8

Beware of risks like this, but also remember that the short term trend remains UP.

### Momentum

Small caps and emerging markets continue to surge higher. Bloomberg publishes a “Fear/Greed” indicator, which is really just a momentum indicator (price drives sentiment). This Fear/Greed indicator for emerging markets is at the highest level since 2007:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/r06zkoqqepb61.png?width=633&format=png&auto=webp&s=82f40c3ad08326189483588620a348e0e84ed628

This may seem scary, but Bloomberg’s Fear/Greed calculation is based on NOMINAL numbers. So as the market goes up over the decades, this figure will naturally become more and more extreme. Hence, it’s better to divide Fear/Greed by the market’s value:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/uee9em0sepb61.png?width=650&format=png&auto=webp&s=42c2d3d127e1d03a7716833a7dfd0b8276164c22

Here, we can see that the adjusted Fear/Greed is high, but this wasn’t bearish in the past. When emerging markets’ momentum was this strong, they usually rallied further over the next 3 months:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4m2s2hzsepb61.png?width=643&format=png&auto=webp&s=8974bfb0c951f11cfb745f12bdacd8b2e4e6503f

This is a bullish reading for emerging markets.

### Breadth

Breadth is very strong across the world. The % of NASDAQ stocks at a 52 week high continues to increase:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/vro2ifmwepb61.png?width=657&format=png&auto=webp&s=b142fafde00fe789ee0ee37ef546f3e1f61f0e2e

Such strong breadth readings were bullish for the NASDAQ over the next 9-12 months:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1z8ebvyxepb61.png?width=642&format=png&auto=webp&s=a538095213db5125e08774cad39582a442765ebb

While it’s important to focus on the trend, it’s also important to beware of mounting risks:

### Speculative signs

Everything small and risky is soaring right now. An index of the most shorted, most leveraged stocks saw its 14 week RSI explode higher. The last 2 times this happened led to sharp corrections in these risky stocks:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/xcq302bzepb61.png?width=653&format=png&auto=webp&s=c42849e15fed5eb2ad006aa453aa712bfeb63f7d

It’s easy to see why investors are plowing into risk. Central banks are flooding the market with an ocean of liquidity:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/b79be6h0fpb61.png?width=664&format=png&auto=webp&s=1a9475570f09e5e1f638c0ec4cf26aeb9b6fd79f

### The everything rally

As I noted on Tuesday, stocks are rallying around the world. The average country’s stock index is 18% above its 200 dma! This is the highest reading in over a decade:

\*I calculated this average using the following countries’ indices: U.S., Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, HK, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, UK, Brazil, China, India, South Korea, Mexico, Taiwan, Russia.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/wv59py12fpb61.png?width=656&format=png&auto=webp&s=b3f8362cd850293af03c1770842d6aff70da666a

When so many stock markets around the world surged in the past, the S&P 500 (which accounts for half of global market cap) usually rallied a little more over the next 3 months, followed by a sharp pullback 6 months later.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/h7586so5fpb61.png?width=644&format=png&auto=webp&s=7ffd754bd546e95bc80f33a7b68522fb4a10715e

High volatility is to be expected in the coming months. The overextended rally can overextend even further, but nothing lasts forever.

Looking more closely within the U.S., micro-cap stocks (the smallest of stocks) are now more than 40% above their 200 day moving average! The last time this happened was in February – March 2000, near the peak of the dot-com bubble.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/dwp03y07fpb61.png?width=654&format=png&auto=webp&s=5baf0689d43653b23922f6093e1214f76897ba67

It’s important to note that this also happened during the first year of the 2003-2007 (September 2003) and 2009-2020 (September 2009) bull markets. In those 2 historical cases, the stock market rallied another 4-6 months before major corrections began. This is a bearish sign for spring & summer 2021.

**Gamma Exposure**

And finally, Gamma Exposure recently hit a record high. High values are bearish and low values are bullish. It’s better to look at Gamma Exposure as a ratio vs. the S&P 500’s value:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/y3f5o4m8fpb61.png?width=646&format=png&auto=webp&s=4d67c8817d9016c5def54226d5ee1b6754a7fdcb

This is a bearish reading. When this happened in the past, the S&P fell -7.3%, -7.9%, and -31% over the next 2 months from where the S&P was as of that date:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/jawwim8bfpb61.png?width=644&format=png&auto=webp&s=478617a7cea452af01f6db2f4736216ee8ae46bd

### Conclusion

1. Long term investors should be highly defensive right now. This speculative bull market may last another 6 months or even 9 months, but in 2 years time, long term investors will be glad they did not buy today.
2. Medium term traders should go neither long nor short.
3. Short term trend followers should continue to ride the bull trend because no one knows exactly when it will end._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning January 18th, 2021 Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/wallstreetbets.

# **Biden heads into inauguration with a stock market tailwind - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/15/biden-heads-into-inauguration-with-a-stock-market-tailwind.html)**
*****
> President-elect Joe Biden moves into the White House in the coming week with the biggest stock market tailwind since a presidential Election Day going back to at least 1952.
*****
> According to CFRA data that begins that year, the near 13% gain since Nov. 3 would be the biggest increase in the S&P 500 between the election and inauguration if the gains hold. President John F. Kennedy’s 8.8% gain had been the best, followed by President Dwight Eisenhower, with 6.3%, and President Donald Trump, with 6.2%.
*****
> Biden’s promise of the $1.9 trillion relief package he announced Thursday is one of the reasons for the stock market’s surge, and it will be a big focus of markets in the week ahead as investors handicap its chances of winning congressional approval.
*****
> The Martin Luther King Jr. Day holiday starts off the week, and over the next four days several dozen S&P 500 companies report earnings. Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, IBM, Intel and Procter & Gamble are among the companies reporting.
*****
> # Biden will have no honeymoon
The $1.9 trillion stimulus package is at the top of the agenda. But there is also significant focus on whether his administration will be better at controlling the pandemic and rolling out the vaccine, as he has promised.
*****
> “This is the number he came in at. Where do negotiations go from here?” Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial, said of the $1.9 trillion package. She pointed to worries about a weakening economy, evident in December’s retail sales data, down a surprising 0.7%, and weekly jobless claims, at the worst level since August.
*****
> “You could argue this is Covid-related and therefore what is most important going forward is to see the logistics of the vaccines, inoculations gain orderly momentum. That is crucial for the market,” she said.
*****
> Krosby said the market is focused on the inauguration.
*****
> “They want to see it go smoothly, and that there’s not any security lapse. The market absorbed the events of Jan. 6. The market looked ahead and figured out that at this point it was a one-off, and the market ended higher on Jan. 6,” she said. “But always the market becomes much more defensive if what we considered an isolated event suddenly broadens out.”
*****
> There will be heightened security surrounding the inauguration after a mob of Trump supporters assaulted the Capitol while Congress was in the process of confirming the Electoral College vote. The House last week voted to impeach Trump for inciting the mob, and now there is concern about further incidents in Washington or at state capitals.
*****
> # Stimulus and stocks
Markets are also watching carefully to see whether Biden can bridge some of the deep divide between Republicans and Democrats, who now hold a thin majority in Congress.
*****
> “We’re getting stimulus, and now the question is ‘OK, you’re supposed to be this great compromiser,’” said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA.
*****
> Political strategists expect Biden will get his stimulus package but it will be trimmed down. Ed Mills, Washington policy analyst at Raymond James, said the package could be cut to about $1 trillion based on the size previously discussed by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and outgoing Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.
*****
> “Does Congress want to have a bipartisan show of support after what has been an extraordinarily tenuous beginning of this year, to put it mildly?” Mills said. He said the stock market should continue to do well because it is going to get stimulus spending.
*****
> “D.C. is going to be there with more spending, or consumers are going to be there with more spending if they have the ability to get to a post-vaccine world sooner,” he said.
*****
> Stovall said that if history is a guide, the stock market should do well with Biden. The average gain of the S&P 500 in the first 100 days for Democratic presidents is 3.5%, going back to 1952. For Republicans in the same period, it’s been an average 0.5%.
*****
> The S&P 500 has also gained an average 11.3% in the first year of a Democratic president, but just 5.7% for Republicans, going back to World War II.
*****
> The stock market will continue to monitor the bond market, after the 10-year Treasury yield reached a high of 1.18% this past week, the highest since March. It since slid back to about 1.08% Friday after the weak data.
*****
> “Other things are going on in the back room. Bond yields have moved up of late, and it was a change. It gave you a sense of how fast rates can move,” said James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Leuthold Group. “It might be a preview of what you can expect this year.”

> # Martin Luther King Jr. Holiday Week Trading: Leans Bearish

> Although Martin Luther King Jr. Day was a holiday in many states and cities throughout the U.S. beginning in 1971, it did not become a federal holiday until 1986. Even then it was not observed by the NYSE until 1998. In the 23 years since, the market’s performance during this four-trading-day week has been somewhat lackluster with average weekly performance negative for DJIA, S&P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000. Average losses range from 0.81% by DJIA to 0.16% by NASDAQ. Of the five indexes, not one has a record better than 50/50. However, since 2012 performance has shown signs of improving. DJIA, NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have risen in six of the last nine years. S&P 500 and Russell 1000 have climbed in five of the last eight.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/67df4ce1594bee9748fb885a5316ff07/b5f21cb74511d020-c9/s500x750/218ed920ea1a67d95ff97fd05a5b9bbdf2454805.jpg))**

> # Seasonal Soft Patch Ahead Starting Next Week

> With nine trading sessions of the New Year complete, January and 2021 are off to a solid start. DJIA is up 1.26% as of today’s close, S&P 500 stands at 1.05%, NASDAQ 1.74% and small caps, measured by the Russell 2000 are up a whopping 9.14%. These gains all point to and confirm the return of seasonality that we have recently noted.

> Last September was weak as it has historically been, then October exhibited it historical tendency toward volatility while November and December were both positive, in line with typical seasonal patterns. A positive Santa Claus Rally and First Five Days are also encouraging indications that seasonal forces are once again tracking. We expect seasonality will continue to present itself going forward as extraordinary efforts are made to quell the pandemic and return to a pre-Covid, open-for-business, way of life.

> Due to the reemergence of seasonality, we would not be surprised to see some market weakness in the second half of January next week that could persist throughout the rest of January and possible spill over into February. In the following seasonal pattern chart of January, the last 21 years of data for DJIA, S&P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and 2000 have been plotted with January 2021 through today’s close plotted on the right vertical axis.

> Over the last 21 years, it has been NASDAQ leading at the halfway point, this year it is Russell 2000. Other than that, the major indexes have been tracking their historical patterns fairly well. There was strength early on, followed by sideways action. Should the current trend follow historical patterns then weakness after the eleventh trading day (January 18) is possible.

> # 5 Charts on the Democratic Blue Wave

> One of the top questions we’ve received recently has been what a blue wave may mean for investments. After the Democrats won the two Senate runoff elections in Georgia, they will now control the White House and both chambers of Congress. Our January 11 Market Policy Projections for 2021 gave some of the immediate and longer-term policy impacts of the Democratic “blue wave,” and here we surf the blue wave with some interesting charts.

> First off, blue waves have not been bearish for stocks, with the S&P 500 Index higher 6 of the past 7 times and up a respectable 9.1% on average since 1950.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Blog-1.15.21-1.png?ssl=1))**

> We shared this chart in 2020, and it shows that historically, stocks do better if an incumbent president wins versus a new president in office. This makes sense, as a new president will bring in new policies and likely question marks—while you know what you will get with a re-elected president. Remember, markets hate uncertainty and surprises.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Econ-blog-1.15.21-2.png?ssl=1))**

> “Make it all nine new Democratic presidents since 1900 to bring with them both the House and the Senate. In fact, stocks do quite well that first year under such circumstances, up nearly 12% on average,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Maybe investors shouldn’t fear a blue wave after all.”

> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, when a new Democratic president has brought with them the House and Senate, stocks gained that first year of their new presidency 6 of 8 times. What stands out to us for 2021, though, is the House majority is only 11—the smallest for a new Democratic president since 1900.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/blog-1.15.21-3.png?ssl=1))**

> Looking at all of the times the Democrats controlled the House (since the 35th Congress when it was Democrats and Republicans), the 11-seat majority is the lowest since 9 seats in 1879. Yes, the Democrats are in power, but this small majority will make it very tough for any of the more extreme policies to pass.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Econ-blog-1.15.21-4.png?ssl=1)**

> Lastly, the Senate is split a perfect 50/50, which is again extremely rare. In the chart below we share the seat difference between the two parties. “A 50/50 Senate coupled with only an 11-seat majority in the House, and it is safe to say we have about as close to a perfectly divided government as we’ve ever seen,” said Detrick.

> # Rest of the World Catching Up

> Over the past year, US equities—proxied by the S&P 500 (SPY)—have consistently outperformed global equities more broadly. As shown below, over the past year the S&P 500 (SPY) has risen just over 16%. That compares to 11.26% for the rest of the world as proxied by the Vanguard FTSE All-World ex US ETF (VEU). Breaking that down a bit further by developed and emerging markets, US equities have outpaced both emerging and other developed markets. While emerging markets (SPEM) are right on the heels of the US with just under a 14.78% gain, developed markets (SPDW) have lagged with just a 10.56% gain. So far in 2021, though, the rest of the world has been outperforming the US. Whereas SPY has risen around 1% YTD, VEU is up almost 3 times that. Emerging markets in particular have shown the greatest degree of strength currently having risen 3.87%. Meanwhile, SPDW has gained less (2.7%), though, it is still outperforming the US.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/011221-ETFs.png))**

> In the charts below, we show the ratio of SPY to these other ETFs. A rising line would indicate that the US is outperforming these other measures of global equities while a downward trending line indicates underperformance of SPY. As shown, the longer-term trend has pretty consistently been US outperformance over the past decade but that has faltered at the tail end of 2020 and into 2021. In the case of emerging markets, the line has been on the decline throughout the second half of 2020 as the ratio has hit its lowest level in a year in the past week. The S&P 500's underperformance relative to other developed markets (SPDW) has been more recent as that line peaked in early September but the trend remains the same over the past few months with SPY weaker than global equities more broadly. That is further exemplified by the recent downtrend of SPY versus the All World ex US ETF (VEU).

> # Small Business Owners Didn't Like the Election Results

> Today's release of the December Small Business Optimism Index from the NFIB saw a large drop as the index dropped from 101.4 to 95.9. After a sharp drop in the wake of the COVID outbreak, the index bounced back nicely but now looks like it's really rolling over.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/011221-NFIB-Small-Business-Chart.png))**

> Not only was this month's headline index weak, but it caught economists completely off guard. While the index fell to 95.9, economists were expecting a drop to 100.2. That 4.3 spread between the actual and expected reading was the biggest miss relative to expectations in more than five years (July 2015) and was the third weakest reading relative to expectations since the December 2012 report.

> Given the big drop in the headline index and the fact that it was so weak relative to expectations, should we be concerned about a double-dip? As an investor, we should always be worried about what could go wrong, but in the case of this report, you can probably wait for further confirmation from other data. The reason for the skepticism is that you could argue that politics plays a role in this report. To illustrate this, we would note that going back to 2010 (as far back as we have data) and right up through Election Day 2016, the NFIB only topped expectations 42% of the time. Following Trump's election in 2016, though, this index surged and has since topped expectations 63% of the time. Since Election Day 2020, though, the headline index has now missed expectations three times.

> From a longer-term perspective, dating back to 1974, the average reading of the NFIB Small Business Index during Republican administrations has been 100.1 while the average level under Democratic Presidents has been 96.2. Now, that would make sense if the economy was also in a recession more often in those periods, but over that same span, even though the percentages are low for both political parties (<20%), the economy has actually been in a recession a higher percentage of the time during Republican administrations than it has in Democratic administrations.

> The lesson to take from all this is that even if it's often hard to separate when it comes to business or investing (or a lot of other aspects of our lives for that matter), it's usually best to leave politics outside.

# DISCUSS!

What are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?

*****

I hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great week ahead r/wallstreetbets._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Top 3 short positions as of 1/15/2021 $GME $LGND $BBBY _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Tin-foil hat theory: Was $BB a pump and dump? I'll preface this with a disclaimer. I'm most likely too deep into GME to see the big picture, and that's why I want some perspective from other users here. Things just *appear* to align, but sometimes things happen on their own and isn't evidence of a conspiracy altogether. I want this to be the beginning of a discussion, and possible investigation, not the end of one. 

Here's the quick hypothesis, and I'll post some brief supporting pieces of data below.

The upcoming short squeeze has the old money scared as fuck, and pissed as fuck at us. They've altogether already lost *nearly a billion shorting GME.* I'd love to see that loss porn. 

Question: How much would it cost to hire a troll farm to start a disinformation campaign? Something to help distract even a portion of a large group of users away from their quarry? Astroturfing is a real big thing, it's been used all over reddit for at least the last 5 years or so, facebook, etc. With the recent election wrapped up, I suspect these troll farms probably have a lot of availability for large firms who have a lot to lose. For just a couple million dollars, they could save hundreds of millions, by infiltrating this subreddit. And I wonder if they have? I think it's a safe assumption they know about us. Especially after the mainstream attention we're getting.

So that's the hypothesis. And here's some of my supporting ideas that I'd really hesitate to call "evidence".

GME starts the blowup on Jan 13th. The very next day, the long dormant BB starts blowing up a little bit. I don't know when BB started getting pumped on this subreddit and I don't know where to find out, but I *suspect* that started on **the day** GME started blowing up.

On Friday the 15th, the day a lot of shorts have to be paid back in there was a massive push by brand new accounts, heavily pushing BB, and a lot of other things. A lot of "fellow kids" kinds of posts, every 10 seconds there was a new one. Most were filtered out by the mods, and a lot of them were down-voted quickly by people on /new. I'd be really interested in seeing some figures on this though, or maybe an opinion on how much more active Friday morning was compared to a normal day from a mod like /u/zjz for instance who I know was cleaning up a huge amount of garbage posts. 

To be fair there were a huge amount of garbage GME posts too. But I'd like to think after a 100% gain over 2 days there would be substantial buzz here, and with the MOASS on the horizon that we ALL know about, you'd think that GME would be once again the only topic of discussion here. But it was far less posted about from my totally subjective, totally biased perspective. 

After hours on Thursday, BB was also pumped up quite a massive amount. This is what I see as the bait at the end of the fishing hook. But then despite all of the YOLO posts I saw on /new the stock continued to drop throughout the day, ending back where it started at the EOB on Thursday. I don't know how much it would cost to pump BB from $9 to $10, but I bet it costs less than the billions hedge funds stand to lose on GME going through the roof.

So I know this sounds nuts. I know I'm biased, and I'm trying to make sense of yesterday. But also, doesn't some of this align too well? Can anyone with the means pull some numbers together to see if this hypothesis holds water?

Also, see you on the moon everyone! :)_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ APHA/TLRY arbitrage opportunity - literally free money Fellow tards, while there have been quite a few posts on this subject, none of them explained how you could make some risk free 🚀🚀🚀.

At the time of posting, APHA=0.63*TLRY and they will merge at APHA=0.8381*TLRY. 

We can easily see that APHA is relatively undervalued, but can you set your positions as to have a 100% profit chance? The answer is yes.

Let's denote with A and T the current prices and with A' and T' their converged pre-merger prices. Let's also call r1 and r2 their current and future ratios.

We now have A=r1*T and A'=r2*T' and thus A'/A=T'/T *(r2/r1).

Setting a long position of p on A and shorting T with q, our return will be p*(A'/A - 1) - q(T'/T - 1) = A'/A * (p - q*r1/r2) + p - q .

We now notice that we must set p=q*r1/r2 to negate A'/A from our return, and be independent from Apha's return.

Under this scenario, having a short position of q on TLRY and a long position on Apha equals to q*r1/r2 we have a guaranteed profit of q*(1-r1/r2) when the market prices converge, right before the merger.

So, how does this look under our current values? Currently r1/r2 is roughly 3/4. This means you should go short on TLRY for $4x and long on APHA for $3x and have a guaranteed return on $x.

While this is only a 14% return, it's as safe as you'll get, and can increase it through margin/leverage (just make sure you understand your brokers policies regarding margin call and stop-loss).


Risks: something goes wrong with the merger or they decide to change the ratio


**TL;DR**: Short TLRY $40k and long APHA $30k get free $10k (or more with leverage) . Not the biggest 🚀, but a pretty safe 🚀.


Note: I'm not a financial advisor, shit can go wrong, don't trust everything you read; re-check the math/log, do independent dd._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Why $BB will moon 🚀 So I have been doing some research into institutional money moving in and out of $BB and you Retards are going to love my findings. 

The last large institutional sell off occurred in March of 2020. A ton of five star Morningstar rated funds sold off millions of shares, I’m talking 7-8 million dollars worth per fund. 

The last large institutional buy was Dec. 31st. Multiple three star funds bought up hundreds of thousands of dollars worth in $BB. This tells us that institutional money is betting on a strong 2021. All the funds that sold in March paper handed their shares and could get FOMO if the stock continues to hold above $9. 

$BB is not even in the first 20 pages of the list of the “most shorted stocks” in the market... GME is number 1 and look what is happening. 

Morningstar and CFRA both put $BB with a fair value price of 6.40, so you can assume that is the absolute bottom. 

The CEO formerly was the head of a software company that was on the brink of bankruptcy that he restructured, brought back to profitability, then sold to SAP for 5.8 billion dollars. 

Biden Administration is pushing for a huge cyber security restructuring in light of the Solar Winds hack. $BB already does contract work for the US Air Force. 

This is a long term play. But the prospects of future profitability are incredibly high. Hold the line gentlemen. 
I’m in at 500 Shares. See you on the Moon 🌝_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ GME Squeeze, was this it?? (DD & comparison) Barrons [wrote an article](https://www.barrons.com/articles/gamestop-stock-doubled-last-weekbut-challenges-remain-51610751952) that the GME squeeze has happened, and hedge funds lost 1 billion and that is it. 

What I read out of this article is desperation. Their daddies, the very hedge funds that are betting against us Wallstreetbettors, obviously push those news, place them like paid for PR. Something a lot of people have to understand, is that that is all a very normal way of playing the game. **Fake news!** Don't believe anything someone with opposite interests than yours says. 

The fact of the matter is, the net short position has increased by around 2% yesterday. They throw even more money after their bad money to recoup their losses.
The spike was caused by more and more retail and institutional investors realising this is actually going to happen and buying in.

For a lot of people (like Burry, Mashaal, cohen obviously and others) this is an opportunity. Institutions like blackrock or Senvest are buying in to take the money of the melvins of this world.

Let's compare this to other famous short squeezes: [VW Squeeze](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Nr8vkBriAuo/U0RSt0E3_1I/AAAAAAAAAs0/fDcm_9XTzI0/s1600/volkswagen.gif)

Where are we at? either in June or September! 

The actual panic, the grappling, the desperation, the higher bidding, the margin calls, all that hasn't even started yet!

I'm not suggesting that this will a couple months to play out, nowadays things move faster, but it will happen soonish.


TLDR: $GME to 3200, Diamond hands and rockets. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ ALL in BB ! _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Is the GME situation similar to the VW 2008 situation?? So I brought the dip yesterday after doing some research but I want to discuss whether the VW MOASS is really a valid comparison to what we are seeing now with GME.  Obviously, I see the potential for gains here, but I’m questioning the comparison to a short squeeze that made a struggling company the most valuable one in the world for a few days. 

I’ve seen the GME situation compared quite a bit to the VW Mother of all Short Squeezes. One of the major differences I see is that in 2008, Porsche owned 74% of the public float and Lower Saxony owned another 20%.  

In this situation, you had two entities controlling 94% of the available shares. 


In GME, while the stock is heavily shorted, there are far more shares held by far more people, companies, and hedge funds who own tons of shares (compared to my 200) that can be dumped at any time as short sellers need to cover their positions. 

So with this in mind, does wsb really think this is comparable to the MOASS?  If so, why? What am I missing._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ New study from Ohio State U warns against "trendy investment areas like cannabis, cybersecurity and work-from-home businesses." _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ We Retards R Gayning Trakshin _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ My first 700% gain on 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉 _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ DD for AZEK Greetings,

I will be brief and not too technical on this one. "Buy what you know." I am a home builder and remodeler, so I am always looking at related securities. I am very bullish on AZEK for a number of reasons, some are fundamental, some are spiritual. I apologize in advance that this stock does not involve sex robots, space exploration, rna recalibration, vaccination, or any other HOT TOPICS. There are some elements of futurism in this, so pay attention.

1. Azek has a great product.  Azek's flagship product is exterior trim and molding. It is made of PVC so it does not rot. They make little plugs to cover the screw holes, so you don't have to paint it either. No maintenance. There is room to capture more of the market share as people move away from using wood on the exterior of homes. Both Lowes and Home Depot carry this material. They also manufacturing decking and railing. It also owns Versatex, which was formerly a competitor in the PVC trim category. The other PVC competitors are Veranda (garbage made by Home Depot), Kleer (made by Boral), and Royal (owned by westlake). I dont really see these as tough competition. Kleer and Royal are sold at some lumber yards, but are not sold at Lowes or HD. The word "azek" has become the propriety endonym for all similar products.
2. Their biggest competitor in the composite and pvc decking arena is TREX. Trex does not have a competing line of exterior trim. As AZEK's share of the decking space grows, they will outpace TREX.
3. A potential competitor in the exterior trim field is another product made by Boral called TruExterior. It is made from poly-ash and is more popular in commercial applications. Its very soft and easy to damage. It does need to be painted, and I think its total garbage. It does not work as easily with tools as azek does. (You do not need specialty tools for either, regular carpentry tools suffice.)
4. Both TREX and AZEK highlight that their number 1 competitor is wood. Lumber prices have skyrocketed during covid as a result of mills closing. This is shrinking the price gap between pressure treated pine decking (i.e low cost) and composite/pvs decking. This will push more consumers towards AZEK (and TREX for that matter). In the high end market, expensive exotic hardwoods are used for exterior decking, but with these prices shooting up even more, these consumers will also look towards alternatives.
5. AZEK sells EXTERIOR products. Builders in northern climates push all of their exterior work towards the spring and summer months. Considering the percentage of the US population that lives in cold regions (Northeast US, Northern Midlands, etc), we should expect to see sales increases starting in the early spring. I do not think the market is pricing this in.
6. They recently introduced recycling initiatives into their business. They leave collection boxes at lumber yards for the scraps and manufacture their products with recycled materials. This is a nice bit of PR for them as stock pickers start to look for these environmentally conscious companies.
7. I am not incredibly focused on fundamental analysis (because I'm a fucking meathead carpenter not a finance dweeb), but I will copy paste from their most recent presentation:
8. – Q4 2020: Adjusted EBITDA increased 26% YOY; Adjusted EBITDA Margin expanded 60bps YOY to 25.0%
9. – 2020: Adjusted EBITDA increased 19% YOY; Adjusted EBITDA Margin expanded 110 basis points YOY to 23.7%
10. – 2020: Adjusted Diluted EPS of $0.59, an increase of 37% over $0.43 in 2019
11. – Net leverage stands at 1.2x at the end of fiscal 2020

This company is growing and as it does we will see the multiple grow as well. They are increasing their production capabilities, and this summer is going to be huge sales for them. The residential building industry is insane right now. The upper middle class and wealthy have been largely unaffected financially by covid, and they are the buyers for renovations, remodels, repair, and new construction. People are stuck at home and have become obsessed with improving their homes. People want new kitchens, baths, and home offices, but they also want to build decks, replace their window trim and rotting fascia.

IN SHORT YOU SHOULD BUY THIS STOCK OR LEAPS. Buy it now while it is cheap and wait for this summer when other buyers become obsessed with buying companies like this one.

Please do your own research before you buy:[https://s2.q4cdn.com/941338550/files/doc\_presentations/2020/12/AZEK-Co-Investor-Presentation-December-2020-vFinal.pdf](https://s2.q4cdn.com/941338550/files/doc_presentations/2020/12/AZEK-Co-Investor-Presentation-December-2020-vFinal.pdf)

TLDR: I am a home builder and remodeler and I am telling you AZEK is a better company than TREX.

&#x200B;

Positions: I have 7% of my portfolio in AZEK common stock_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Here are the top 3 IPOs from last week over a billion market cap. Affirm led last IPOs. **1. AFRM (⬆️ 138%)**

Affirm (AFRM), an online payments company founded by Max Levchin, began trading on the Nasdaq this Tuesday. It priced its shares at $49 apiece, above its target range of $41 to $44 each.

By the end of the day, it had soared 98%, closing at $97. With 242.7 million shares outstanding following the offering, the company has obtained an $11.6 billion valuation at the offer price.

With shares doubling to $97 on their opening day, this valuation has jumped to $23.5 billion, and now at $130 the valuation has risen towards $31.5 billion.

As the week ends, it’s now at $117, a 138% change from its IPO.

&#x200B;

**2. POSH (⬆️ 98%)**

The online clothing reseller Poshmark (POSH) opened its first day of trading on the Nasdaq this Thursday ending the day up more than 141% in the company’s market debut.

After marketing for $35 - $39, they opened at $42 giving it an initial valuation of more than $3 billion. It closed the day trading at $101,50, valuing Poshmark at about $8.5 billion on a fully diluted basis including options and restricted stock units, raising a total of $277 million.

By Friday it closed at $83.20. More 98% than the opening price.

&#x200B;

**3. WOOF (⬆️ 52.8%)**

The pet retailer Petco Health and Wellness Co. Inc. (WOOF) also went public this Thursday.

After its IPO at $18, it shot up by 63% closing the day at $29.40 - their own estimates were between $14 and $17.

With it, the company’s market value went to $6.4B, having raised $864 million the IPO. By the end of the week, it closed at $27.5, 52.8% more than its IPO._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ GME - Directors also seem to believe there is more upside to the current stock prize. With good reason! Don't let the shorts shake you out 🚀🚀 See the SEC information on insider trading for GME here: https://www.secform4.com/insider-trading/1326380.htm

In addition to James Wolf apparently being forced to sell a portion of his GME Holdings for his funds risk balancing purposes, three other GME Directors have also sold a PORTION of their shares in the last days. 

Please notice how each of them has only sold around half of their current holdings, with Mrs. Dunn only selling roughly 8% (she is the smartest of the bunch I guess). 

Now ask yourself, why would these GME directors not just sell of all of their shares in GME after such an explosive rise in the stock's prize? 

BECAUSE 1) THEY ARE IN THE KNOW OF FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS TO COME  and 2) THEY BELIEVE MORE UPWARDS MOVEMENT WILL COME. 

Surely it makes sense for them to cash out a portion after such a run up, they would even be fools not to do so. However they must be aware of the short squeeze phenomenon, as well as have some insider knowledge as to the development and the future/potential of the company. If these people are willing to keep holding most of their shares in GME, THEN SO SHOULD YOU. 

HOLD THE LINE MY FELLOW RETARDS  AND BE HEAVILY REWARDED 🚀🚀🚀_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ 105% portfolio diversification - loaded up another 1000 shares yesterday. Doing my part! GME to the Moon!!! 🚀🚀🚀🚀 _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $PLTR - The Big DDD  I don't get what you guys are worried about with PLTR.

Here's my **personal** DD on PLTR, you're welcome to read and do whatever you want. Other helpful info or pointing out mistakes in my DD is very welcome.

Fears preventing you from buying PLTR

1. Targeted ads on your phone from Yahoo Finance or Zacks telling you PLTR = BAD!!!1!eleven
2. Shills spamming "pLtR tO tHe MoOn" and :rocket: on PLTR thread comments.
3. Last quarter's seemingly bad financials/earnings.
4. Financials Moving Forwards
5. Soros who owns 21 million shares "threatening" to sell his shares upon DPO expiry.
6. DPO expiry 3 days after February's earnings and possible insiders and DPO holders sale and dip.
7. What does PLTR tldr.
8. Other Information

&#x200B;

***#1 Targeted Ads***

Ads and articles are both paid for by someone.The fact that in the past 3 weeks i've been getting multiple multiple targeted ads on my phone related to PLTR since i love PLTR so much.

Ads are telling me that PLTR is bad, doesn't provide a dividend, they're telling me PLTR's fair price is 20 instead of 25 based on some financial model and have gone as far as to provide a list of alternative stocks to buy.

To me, this all screams: **SCARE TACTICS**

Additionally, the last few weeks of ups and downs in PLTR's stock price is another indication of the attempts to short the stock to sh!t and drive investors out. (For what reason? I don't know.)

&#x200B;

***#2 Shilling PLTR***

I myself love to shill PLTR to people whenever i can. I do this because i legitimately think this company will do great. I work as a product manager in a software development house and understand what PLTR does. PLTR is not cryptic.Regardless, i think when people shill PLTR to you, they are right to do so as you're probably missing out on a great opportunity to make money in the long run. If you're looking for big gains short term, maybe try something else.

Shillery is OK, but at least give the facts.

&#x200B;

***#3 Last Quarter's Bad Financials***

If you'd done your DD not by searching reddit posts but by checking PLTR's actual quarterly report, you'd know that PLTR's "bad" last financial quarter/earnings were due to the costs of listing themselves on the *New York Stock Exchange*.\~855million were spent on listing and stock related compensations and this is the big reason.

**Direct quote by PLTR here:** [https://investors.palantir.com/news-details/2020/Palantir-Reports-Revenue-Growth-of-52-in-the-Third-Quarter-Raises-Full-Year-2020-Guidance/default.aspx](https://investors.palantir.com/news-details/2020/Palantir-Reports-Revenue-Growth-of-52-in-the-Third-Quarter-Raises-Full-Year-2020-Guidance/default.aspx)

>We incurred a loss from operations of $847.8 million, which includes $847.0 million in stock-based compensation following our recent direct listing.

I would like to remind everyone that this is a **1 TIME THING.** Put simply, this means that PLTR won't have as excessive losses next quarter as they did this last quarter.

*Additionally*, let me go into further detail on this and not just leave it to that.

* ***PLTR's quarterly operating expenses for the past 3 quarters were at around \~260 million.***
* ***PLTR's operating expenses this quarter were \~987 million.***

ADDITIONALLY...

PLTR also had a higher R&D cost this quarter that just passed. Normally they'd pay 80 million on R&D, but somehow ended up paying \~300 million this quarter. No one knows why, but this is another thing that influenced PLTR's earnings.

[https://investors.palantir.com/news-details/2020/Palantir-Reports-Revenue-Growth-of-52-in-the-Third-Quarter-Raises-Full-Year-2020-Guidance/default.aspx](https://investors.palantir.com/news-details/2020/Palantir-Reports-Revenue-Growth-of-52-in-the-Third-Quarter-Raises-Full-Year-2020-Guidance/default.aspx)

>On September 30, 2020, in connection with the Direct Listing, we incurred $769.5 million and $8.4 million of stock-based compensation using the accelerated attribution method related to the satisfaction of the performance-based vesting condition for RSUs and growth units, respectively, that had satisfied the service-based vesting condition as of such date.

&#x200B;

***#4 PLTR financials moving forwards***

PLTR is deep in bed with the government and the Biden regime although may look like it would be against using PLTR is in fact secretly very pro-surveillance e.g pro Palantir.

Here's some of the known organizations in the US Govt that use PLTR:

1. CDC
2. Office of the Secretary
3. Food and Drug Administration
4. Immigration and Customs Enforcements / ICE
5. Internal Revenue Service / IRS
6. National Institute on Drug Abuse
7. DOD/ARMY - ACC Aberdeen Proving Ground
8. Coast Guard / DHS
9. DOD/NAVY - Naval Information Warfare Systems Command
10. US Attorney's Offices / DOJ
11. US Special Operations Command / SPEC OPS

Boys. The big institutional people know these things. You just found this out. See how deep PLTR is already in bed with the Government?????? Palantir IS the next Raytheon/Lockheed of DATA aggregation and visualization.

***UPCOMING EARNINGS***

I've done some quick maths and it looks like PLTR is more likely to be in positive earnings this quarter and with a 0.02 cent EPS target, we can easily assume that they'll destroy this with maybe 0.04 or 0.08 EPS. In the worst case scenario, PLTR's EPS this quarter could be somewhere around MINUS -0.05 ish due to interview costs and ad/campaigning costs that were not there before the company was listed.

***WHAT CAN DESTROY PALANTIR***

Now, there's big possible downsides and Palantir can fail IF contracts that expire are not renewed. That's biggest REAL reason for Palantir's balance sheet getting screwed.

I've seen a disturbing pattern with PLTR's financials and that's that every year, it's R&D cost is rising by between 150 and 350 million dollars. This is quite a bit of negative revenue and if new contracts are not constantly coming in, PLTR's balance can start going into the negative.

***WHAT WILL NOT DESTROY PALANTIR***

Some people may have concerns over the new left leaning government dumping PLTR. An article was posted that is behind a paywall EVERYWHERE that goes something like this:

[https://www.thedailybeast.com/cdc-officials-urge-biden-team-to-dump-palantirs-covid-tracker](https://www.thedailybeast.com/cdc-officials-urge-biden-team-to-dump-palantirs-covid-tracker)

In my opinion, i believe this is inconsequential and that a few people crying to daddy Biden to kill a multimillion contract with PLTR is a stretch. Also we know the current new Biden team has his hands full and will have them full for at least the next 1 year with what's going on.

There is no time to deal with a few crybabies and even if he did deal with it and did decide to kill the PLTR Tiberius Covid tracker contract with the CDC which he WONT, these things take months and years to deal with, and by then the contract/s will have already brought PLTR tons of money and revenue in.

***HOW MUCH DOES KARP AND HIS GOONS GET PAID***

Short answer is... A LOT. The amounts below are PER YEAR. That's a lot of money in the hole and contributes to annoying amount to why PLTR is always just at the edge of just barely being profitable.

https://preview.redd.it/ba58nqcurob61.png?width=2615&format=png&auto=webp&s=55d45833faad4d60ea8dc142a9601c44b4cc7395

Palantir's prospectus 311 page document's 130 last pages are almost all exclusively talking about extremely complicated options trading schemes that are made by Cohen and others to make sure they can squeeze out a LOT of money out of PLTR.

Mithril Investments has existed from before and is not a new company. Owned by Thiel/Cohen/Karp as a way to launder and exchange options for more options and more money for all 3 of them. Also Shyam Sankar to me feels corrupt which scares me a bit, he's had some very shady dealings and has brought his wife in PLTR that gets paid 200k per year.

Prospectus Document: [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1321655/000119312520230013/d904406ds1.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1321655/000119312520230013/d904406ds1.htm)

I suggest you skim through it, it contains EVERYTHING about Palantir.

**Palantir is going to need to have to be getting AT LEAST 500 million in NEW contracts per year to REMAIN BARELY profitable. It's doable in my opinion, but just barely and it's why they made the company public to try and get more people's attention and increase the inflow of contracts.**

&#x200B;

***#5 Soros and his 21 million shares***

First of all, i think we can all agree that Soros can suck it.

If you've read a few articles here and there, you'll know that Soros owns/owned 1% of Class A PLTR shares. No one knows whether he's sold them yet or if he's an DPO holder who'll sell 3 days after February's earnings.

Whether he sells them or buys more will be mostly inconsequential in my opinion. We see dips and pumps every day. He legally cannot sell his shares all at once, he'll have to sell certain amounts daily and over time. This will create annoying sideways motion as shares exchange hands and consolidation starts for 2-3 weeks until his and insider shares exchange hands.

Nothing special to see here, move along just a little draw down resulting in some consolidation.

PLTR is exposed to OIL more than anything, so fluctuations in the general market and general market crashes affect PLTR much less than other stocks. Also PLTR does not track ANY benchmarks. NONE.

&#x200B;

***#6 DPO expiry 3 days after earnings in February***

To my limited knowledge, this is how BIG plays who are holding DPO shares usually work:

* If a stock has performed well up to earnings and investors are more than happy with the returns, they're more likely to not sell their stock or just sell less than they normally would.
* If a stock hasn't performed as well as investors thought, these investors are more likely to sell stock or reduce their positions more than normal.

There's a total of 1.16Billion Class A PLTR shares currently (Give or take don't flog me). We are currently trading with \~250 million shares while the rest are locked away in the DPO.

When those shares are "unlocked" in February, the price of the stock won't be diluted. These shares already exist and are accounted for. They are simply locked. Also when they are unlocked, the share price won't simply multiply because all shares are now tradeable.

>According to [Palantir’s after-hours filing with the SEC this afternoon](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1321655/000119312520257973/d89036dex991.htm), the company has 1.16 billion Class A shares, 484 million Class B shares and 1 million Class F shares on its cap table outstanding today, or a total of roughly 1.64 billion. Only Class A shares will trade, and Class B and F shares are convertible to Class A shares on a one-to-one basis. On a fully diluted basis, which Palantir says represents 2.2 billion shares total according to its most recent S-1 filing, the company is valued at $16 billion. The difference between those two aggregate numbers comes from outstanding stock performance grants, warrants and other financial instruments.

What **WILL** affect stock price:

* Employees exercising their non class A options into Class A shares. This IS dilution.
* The bigwigs e.g Alex Karp, Peter Thiel and a few other bigshots exercising their options and then selling them for a profit.

*To note, regular employees will barely affect the price of the stock with their miniscule share holdings. Alex Karp, Peter Thiel and a handful of other high ranked executives in PLTR are the ones that will create a tiny but manageable ripple in the stock price.*

What **COULD** affect the stock price a lot:

* Massive sell off by the big institutional holders.
* Not shorters. (Citron and Citi can suck it, we're in control here)
* People with weak spaghetti wet paper hands.
* Everyone fomoing the same weeklies e.g like when everyone bought Jan 15 calls on everything.
* Big but silent scare campaign (that's already going on) to scare off normies like us.

&#x200B;

***#7 What does PLTR do, tldr.***

Imagine Facebook's database of everything about everyone & Youtube's Database of everything & Geolocation data in a database made by the US Army for known terrorist cells.

Palantir allows you to select and match varied data TYPES from several different database, combine it in any way you want and visualize it so that it's human readable by even the dumbest person in the room so that even they can see patterns and come to conclusion on a subject matter.

It's kind of like filling an excel sheet with data and then visualizing it with a bar chart, except the date you filled the sheet with can be anything and not just numbers or dates or countries and you can make various combinations using all the different rows of data to maybe come up with a pattern to something like how to best distribute the Covid vaccines in the counties in a very specific state in the US.

Literally what you see in SciFi movies where people combine random data by smashing keys on a keyboard and somehow find the murderer, the location of a terrorist or the percentage that someone will commit a murder in the future based on a lot of random data about that person or the area, country, family, history... anything.

While this all might sound super cool and amazing, it is. Maybe in 10 years time there will be a few more companies doing this, but for now, it's only Palantir, Circles, Alteryx and a few other private entities that do this type of thing. Many of them work with governments and are hush hush due to the kinds of things they use this type of software for (terrorist cells, warzones, etc) and the public backlash this could cause.

tldr: Glorified data aggregator and visualization platform/software with different access levels for different people.

**PLTR is superbly positioned to offer their software to SLOW and Boomer like organizations like Governments.**

Governments are stupid and don't have neither the time, nor technical knowledge to develop this software themselves for internal use. This is what PLTR capitalizes on and why Governments use them so much.

Governments could have spent the a fraction of the money they spend on PLTR contracts to make the software themselves but only for their own internal systems and use, but they can't and if they tried, they'd fail because technocracy in governments is not a thing. By the time they'd even complete a project like this, it'd likely be out of spec, unusable and would require further development and money and we know how slow and bad governments are at doing even the basics. Again PLTR wins because of this.

**PLTR is likely NOT** to be adopted by giants like Google or FB or other modern tech organizations of any size because they are not stupid. They have their own purpose built internal systems that they use to do everything related to data aggregation and visualization because they have the technical knowledge and resources. Buying PLTR for their use is a joke.

PLTR capitalizes on being general a general purpose tool and is set up manually by an engineer over the course of 4-10 days for each customer. The engineer customizes and configures the system for each company's custom use since the software allows you to do so. Regular aggregation and visualization software CAN do the same, but typically lacks data input types and features that PLTR has because PLTR has cultivated a special set of features over many years that were suggested by their existing clientele in battlefields and other places.

Now friends, here's my position on PLTR. I'll be holding onto it for the next year. If it's not at least 300% by then, i'm selling it and moving on to the next stock. App i'm using is Revolut.

Also yes, i'm ALL-IN only on Palantir because i know my money will multiply itself in the short term. I'm not holding this till 2025 as others are supposedly doing. I'm selling in 2022 with 300% or more profit. PLTR is severely undervalued, underpriced because it's a DPO. Give it till EOY and we're going to be rich. If it was an IPO it'd be trading at 180+ already imho.

I've spent the last month and a half holding PLTR. I've gone full schizzo mode when it comes to PLTR. I lose sleep daily and i love it. I hadn't slept for 37 hours a few days ago because i spent so much time researching PLTR and scraping the internet for all possible information.

I come from an IT/Development background, so i understand what PLTR does completely.

My PT's for PLTR are:

* 48-89 by March or April.
* 75 - 125 by EOY.
* 200+ 2022 IF they solve their income and constantly increasing R&D cost issues.

Don’t miss out like you did with $GME Yesterday we ended the day on a 3% gain, albeit this was a 10%+ gain at some points but the market went red as a whole so this is understandable. Regardless, there’s a number of reasons to be loading up on SHARES before the 🚀 takes off.

1. Institutional’s are loading up on PLTR prior to the major catalysts (ARK recently upped their stake by 497,100 shares and so did another number of firms).

2. Demo Day: 26th of Jan we’ll see PLTR do a demonstration day of their main product offerings. This will undoubtedly draw attention and traction to the stock as people better understand the recent standardisation of PLTR’s software. This standardisation is what has enabled them to target over 6,000 large institution/enterprise customers across all verticals. Ultimately this will show their commercial viability outside of what they’re known for (governmental contracts) and will result in a stock uptick due to their future viability.

3. Earnings Day: Early February we shall see PLTR’s earnings report for Q420. This should also cover some of the forward-looking aspects of it’s recently acquired contracts alongside projections. If you are unaware of those contracts, see the link here: [LINK](https://investors.palantir.com/home/default.aspx)

As Palantir will most likely pass $1bn in revenue, this is likely to be a big day.


4. Lockup period: Employees and the like are able to liquidate some of their positions come mid February. This has obvious negative connotations to it but for the most part what most people don’t understand is that there will only be a minuscule amount of shares which will be CASHED in. Employees will not cash in all their shares as they will also notice and realise the growth potential of their stock options. They will maybe cash in a small amount if needed but the firm has just began properly marketing their product and concentrating on business development, employees and us alike know the growth potential of this stock.

Once a lower-than-anticipated amount of stock is liquidated, this will most likely have an inverse effect. People will realise that this dip won’t happen and there will be a scrambled influx to buy in. Most likely driving the stock up and pushing it to ATH (unless we have another Citi downgrade bcos IBs love a bit of MM).


That’s all.

Yesertday GME had almost 8k ticker mentions in a single 24 hr period, which I think was the most ever for any ticker (sorry TSLA & NIO). Today was quite similar, here were the ticker mentions by volume.

At around 10.60 I thought this thing is going to rally into close - so another 500 shares.  Average now around 10.92.  

It didn’t rally.  

Around 20 minutes before close I bought 25 covered calls 1/22 @ 15 for .35.  IV crazy. 

Did I stop there? No. After-hours it hits 9.60, so yeah, another 500 shares.  Average is now around 10.70.  46 cents better than the original buy, so I’m already a winner here.  

With those covered calls, the price is really only 10.35.  Even more of a winner. 

And if on Tuesday it opens at 9, guess what? Another 1,000 shares.  Bring that average down again - thinking 10.28.  Grab more of those covered calls.

I won’t stop.  I can’t. BB can’t beat me. 

I hear the fundamentals are good.  I also hear that people who look at fundamentals aren’t winners. And I’m a winner.  An averaging down, covered call, BB winner.  

(Current loss on BB - $3,330)

EDIT:  I figured by using the term “covered call” one would realize that I SOLD the 15 strike calls to cover my shares.  Reading the comments it’s clear I shouldn’t assume that._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ GME First Blood _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ The $GME Club 🚀🚀🚀 _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ 35,550.00% $GME _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ FUCK MELVIN CAPITAL _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ JD -> Chinese Amazon.

GME 425 shares, 4/16 19c_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ PSA: Do NOT buy GME on margin First: 🚀🚀🚀

Now, on to the business at hand.

A lot of you are making the correct choice in buying shares at this point in the game while waiting for the short squeeze - which could be coming as soon as Tuesday now that SEC Rule 201 is in play. 

But some of you are extra greedy/retarded and are buying GME ***on margin***

I'm here to tell you that you are potentially fucking over the short squeeze by doing so. 

**If "Fidelity and Schwab are confirmed to have eliminated margin" it means all the traders that bought on margin will get a MARGIN CALL and be forced to either liquidate their positions or add more funds.**

That means the 100,000 shares you bought on margin are going to be forcibly liquidated when you can't cover the actual cost of getting them. 

**This will force prices down.**

And I know for a fact that most of you have zero porfolio diversity to liquidate, especially retards who are buying GME shares on margin. 

**tl;dr:** If you're buying GME shares, you want to buy with cash on hand and nothing more

Alternatively, buy LEAPs with as high strike as possible - follow u/deepfuckingvalue and hop on mid-April calls

Finally: 🚀🚀🚀

Obligatory I'm long on GME and do not plan on opening more positions if the SEC ever peeks in here.

You can get sued. While I realize this probably includes people other trading sites, just putting it out there that if you’re retarted enough to leave a negative Google review over this with your real name (as some morons have already done), you leave yourself open to a lawsuit. I won’t link it here but take a look at their listing yourself. 

I’ve heard of lawsuits over actual negative experiences so I can only imagine what this opens up if the reviews are fake. 

TL;DR don’t give your tendies back with a lawsuit_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Two days of sweet BB Gainz with more to come 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 So I've gone ahead and built a balls on balls deep BB position of 40,000 shares and 800ish contracts.   Been in since November.

I'm all now a full conviction retard for BB short and long term. BB is going to co-own with Amazon a universal automotive app store (aka IVY). Ivy is going to net billions in profits using a model similar to the apple app store. It will get going in 2023 and be a big deal a year after.  It will later expand to planes, boats, trains, space and all IoT.

On top of that a viable cybersecurity business with a unique AI component business that is going to get its respect very soon.  Its rivals CRWD, FEYE SNOW etc trade at huge multiples.  In 2020 BB hired a stud sales guy from Citrix and he is in process of achieving real wins. Throw in BB IP licensing and patent sales for good measure and you have a diverse business in the hottest spaces in the market.

Last two days up I'm up \~350k.  Don't care about the fade today, I expected it. Near term we are going to 15, medium term 40ish and beyond that either acquired for 60b or we explode to 100b.

I'm not selling a share until then and will roll all contracts as needed.

Blackberry is on the cusp of being one of the all time great turnaround stories in North American business history.  Forget about stigma from the past when they got crushed by iPhone, that Blackberry doesn't exist any more. WSB is going to be a catalyst for greatness. Let's do this, have no fear.

Real brokers are already bailing out of supplying fuel to this dumpster fire and are likely setting up prepared strategies for how to handle their share of these positions during each phase.

I imagine administration over at Robinhood is too busy selling all of your GME trading data to Melvin to even think about how they're going to sell all of your shares. Their features actively make it worse. Sure, being able to put in ridiculous limit-sell orders is fun. We're mad that Fidelity won't let us do it. But can you even imagine the absurdity of different fills that need to be executed during an event like this? Fills that we need to be quick and precise, and fills that the broker needs to execute well to protect themselves and their customers.

Robinhood doesn't give a single spiced crouton of shit about any of you, and they rarely seem to care about their own future as a company. Their fills are always last in line, and that's assuming the app will even be useable. They have people eating ass during every huge market moment, and they WILL fuck this up, too. At least there isn't a time change...and at least there should be multiple opportunities.

Seriously think about moving your GME positions into a real brokerage. There's still time, and it would probably even be a positive catalyst for the stock if everyone did it.

I don't have the time or the knowledge, but I feel like there needs to be large discussion on how Marginhood has helped create this glorious moment...and how they will also help destroy it.

I want this to get y'all out of the ghetto, not having you unable to even afford a lawyer to sue Robinhood.

Positions: 1200 shares @ 14.50, 350 shares @ 34.05_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Never heard of a short squeeze? Read this great article and watch history rhyme! _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Am I doing it right? 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 Is this what others should do with their shares? _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Here we go(?) Doing my part=>>🚀 _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ GME Short Squeeze Inspiration 🚀🚀🚀 _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $GME who runs wall street? 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ GME Margin Requirement & Margin Call Explanation For Noobs I have seen lot's of question on  Margin Requirements and  confusion  surrounding  it and wanted to clarify it as lot's of information is wrong.  

Margin Requirements effect's both longs and shorts. It effects longs only if shares have been bought on margin and the account is overleveraged, like a true retard like me.  I think because of this lot of shares were also sold today, because the brokerage forced selling.  

Whats an Margin Account ?  (Info From Fidelity) 

A margin account lets you leverage securities you already own as collateral for a loan to buy additional securities. 

What's a Margin Requirement 

Margin requirements tell you how much equity you must have in your account to cover what you’re buying (or what you hold) on margin. The requirements are determined 

1. Federal Requirement . Default Value is 50 percent . Means for 10k account I can only leverage 5k more. For a total account of 15k.  
2. Exchange Requirement . Exchange Requirement is 25 percent 
3. Broker Requirement.   Ranges from 30-100 percent 

I will explain this using my Margin Account.    Below is the my margin  account and the house call which I almost got fucked with. Had to deposit 27k to cover it. 

&#x200B;

[My Margin Account as of 1\/16\/2021](https://preview.redd.it/o3g6us2tsmb61.png?width=1311&format=png&auto=webp&s=9b6bb9ff56625dca063860c3f741f7647f47428c)

&#x200B;

On 1/14/2021 the requirement for GME on Fidelity was 40 percent.  

  

|Number Of Shares|Total Value |Requirement Amount (40%)|Leverage Amount|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|3000|51,000|20,4000|30,600|

Like I true retard I used this 30,600 to buy other shares in the above screenshot.  I bought PLTR, GOEV etc.   

On 1/15/2021 the requirement for GME on Fidelity was changed to 65 percent.  Suddenly the leverage amount dropped for me from 30k to 17k.  Creating a short fall of 12.5k . As I was leveraged to tits I got a email from fidelity regarding this.  I got saved by rising GME price. 

&#x200B;

|Number Of Shares|Total Value |Requirement Amount (65%)|Leverage Amount|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|3000|51,000|33,150|17,850|

&#x200B;

[1\/14](https://preview.redd.it/0wxo93d2vmb61.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=c271ec4efdcb11e3fbf25c28b257bf6860570289)

  

Thankfully price of GME rose from 20 to 31 which increased my total account value and helped in avoiding margin call.  

&#x200B;

On 1/15/2021 Fidelity and others increase there margin requirement to 85 percent or 100 percent in case of schawb. Suddenly all longs holding shares in margin account and tits leveraged and shorts are fucked.   I was suddenly down 17,850-7650 =10,200k. I got a house call/margin call.  As 1/15 was a bear day and my other stocks lost money suddenly I was in red of 23k. 

&#x200B;

|Number Of Shares|Total Value |Requirement Amount (65%)|Leverage Amount|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|3000|51,000|43,350|7650|

 In case of Margin call people have two options to either deposit $ or sell securities. 

I am depositing 27k to cover this shortfall if not I would sell some GOEV and NVAX to cover the shortfall.  In short people have opportunity to cover there margin call and the account is liquidated only when the call is not met or the broker decides the trade is retarded and sell it himself.  

&#x200B;

TLDR : Margin Requirement will cause both long and short to cover and it will also cause some longs who are leveraged to tits to sell the stocks.   This will effect shorts more as they are even more fucked than a long.

Ryan Cohen is all in on GME. From the jump, he has been committed to turning Gamestop into the Amazon of games. He has a throbbing raging hard on to blow GME to the fucking moon. He shitposts on his Twitter about Blockbuster and Jim Cramer. GME is forcing T-rex dinosaur looking wrinkly tapioca pudding eating old fucks off the board. RC is a fellow autist.

But more importantly boys: He's a fucking billionaire. He bought 550 Million dollars of Tesla last year.

GME has 71 Million shares and Papa Cohen can exercise purchase of 7% to up his ownership. That's roughly 5 million shares. 5 Million X $36 is 180 Million. Why would he not spend 1/3 of what he spent on tesla on his own vision? Why the FUCK would Papa Cohen not suck up the rest of his entitled shares to throw green dildos at the shorts. He's an activist and believes in the mission. He can afford it.

I believe we will see news over the long weekend (the perfect catalyst) to increase his %. This would be the ultimate dick slam in the faces of Melvin, Wallstreet, and all the gay bears.

HEY RETARDS IM HERE TO GIVE YOU THE GREATEST  BIDEN PLAY OF ALL TIME, AND ITS CORN🚀🚀🚀🌽🌽🌽🌽

Argentina and Russia are amongst the world's largest corn exporters globally. According to data released by the world's top exports in 2019, Argentina ranked 2 amongst top producers while Russia ranked 8, exporting approximately $4.2 billion and 854.4 million dollars worth of corn. In the 2019/20 season, Argentina had reserved 38.5 m of corn for export. To date, of the total 38.5 M set aside for export, 34.5 M has been authorized for export. During the month of December 2020, the agricultural ministry announced a ban on corn exports, suspending sales for export till February 28, 2021, to control domestic food prices amidst a recession and the COVID-19 pandemic.

Inauguration is Wednesday, Biden WANTS TO TRADE WITH CHINA and we just heard from Chuck Abbott about the latest developments in husking 🌽🌽🌽🌽🌽

“U.S. farmers, who harvested some of their largest corn and soybean crops ever last fall, will reap the highest season-average prices for the crops since the heady days of the commodity boom that ended in worldwide surpluses seven years ago, said the government on Tuesday. Commodity prices are on the rise due to tightening global supplies and large purchases by China, the first country to rebound economically from the pandemic.”

CHINA IS BUYING ALL OF OUR CORN AND WE CANT KEEP UP WITH THE SUPPLY🚀🚀🚀🌽🌽🌽🌽🌽

THIS IS BASIC SUPPLY AND DEMAND ECONOMICS PEOPLE

In a bundle of reports, the USDA said U.S. stockpiles of corn and soybeans, the two most widely planted crops in the country, would shrink to their lowest levels since 2014 when this year’s crops are ready for harvest. At the same time, the average farm-gate price for corn and soybeans this marketing year would be the highest since 2013/14.

The corn crop totaled 14.182 billion bushels, the fifth-largest on record and the soybean harvest, at 4.135 billion bushels, was the fourth-largest, said USDA in a final look at 2020 crops. The figures were smaller than expected by traders, so prices zoomed at the Chicago futures markets. Corn for delivery in March rose by the maximum allowed in a day, 25¢ a bushel, to end the day just above $5.17. March soybeans soared by nearly 46¢ to close above $14.18 a bushel.🚀🚀🚀🚀🌽🌽🌽🌽🌽

THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS
BUY SHARES AND DONT LOOK BACK! ONCE BIDEN TAKES OFFICE THE SHORTAGE WILL BE INCREDIBLE

The 2020 corn crop will sell for an average $4.85 a bushel and soybeans for $11.15 a bushel, compared with the average for $3.56 for corn and $8.57 for soybeans grown in 2019, said the USDA.

THIS IS FUCKING COB MOB🌽🌽🌽🌽

IN AN ARTICLE POSTED JUST LAST NIGHT!!!🚀🚀🚀🚀🌽🌽🌽🌽🌽

“The implementation of a temporary 30,000-ton sales cap from Argentina will affect overall global supply, thus impacting corn futures.
Rising corn demand from China, on account of swineherd rebuilding and expansion, has and will continue to impact corn demand and futures.
Rising coronavirus cases in the U.S. and China might hinder corn domestic consumption, thus impacting futures.

THE RETARD STRENGTH POTENTIAL IS INCREDIBLE! NOT TOO MUCH VOLUME, ALL THE STARS ARE ALIGNING FOR CORN 🚀🚀🚀🌽🌽🌽

THE CONCLUSION: COB MOB BITCH
LOOK AT THAT MASSIVE FUCKING GAP FILL

Corn futures have been on an upward trend since the beginning of 2021. Limited exports from some major producers, and a projected increase in demand from China, due to dwindling reserves and production, will notably impact corn futures and sustain this soft commodity price rally. A spike in COVID-19 cases in the U.S, and China's Hebei province, will affect corn domestic consumption.🌽🌽🌽🌽

Gamestop should do an offering.

I think they should wait until the squeeze really starts, which might be exactly what they are doing!

So here's why:

Let's say they do a 10 mil share offering at $100 per share. That is $1 billion cash that gets added to the company balance sheet! Considering we have popped to $35.5 a share and are still not at 2.5bil market cap, that would have a significant impact on the underlying valuation of the stock.

Ok, I hear the dilution cries coming from the new degens from r/investing...but here's why that doesn't matter. The stock basically has already been trading with 140 million shares outstanding...70 mil legit shares, and 70 mil shadow jutsu short shares. So the share price has been based on the 140mil shares outstanding, even though only 70 mil of them are actual shares.

By adding even 1 billion to the balance sheet, you help the overall fundamentals of the company which would likely cause a huge bull rush into the more attractive company while at the same time triggering short covering. At the end of the day, you issued 10 mil shares, but if more than 10 mil shorts cover, you have created a higher stock price that is actually going to stay there, not just pop for a squeeze.

Example:

With \~70mil outstanding shares and \~70mil shorted shares we have a price of $35.5, lets call it $36. That's a 5.04bil market cap. If no value was added, act like the 1 bil doesn't get added to the balance sheet and we suddenly had 80 mil shares outstanding and let's be nice and call it 20 mil shares short...the current market cap would lead to $50 share price.

This would not just help in the long term, short term as I said, shorts would get spooked, at least the ones that couldn't get into the offering and demand for the underlying shares would increase on both long and short side, so we still get our squeeze given there would still be 60 mil shares short and likely share for share a higher dollar amount because of this increased demand.

So you reduce the overall outstanding shares by scaring away shorts and boost the long term stock price by increasing company financials...great now what?

Well you also just gave Wallstreet's golden boy an established company with huge customer loyalty and depth and SPAC level free cash. I don't know what it will take for Cohen to turn Gamestop into the powerhouse we all know it can be, but a billi certainly wouldn't hurt.

Paying off the expensive outstanding senior debt that stops them from issuing dividends, using the cash to build new long term infrastructure, buying back shares after the squeeze; basically it doesn't hurt any of us for Cohen to have an extra bill to play with.

This is all hypothetical, and they could issue no shares or more shares than my example. Personally I would rather Cohen use the shorts to springboard his redemption story of Gamestop forward by a few years, but I don't think infinity squeeze is mutually exclusive to this event. 

We can squeeze the shorts, making sweet tendies short term, and let GME get that sweet $$$ itself. I believe this would cut down our post squeeze hold time significantly and allow Ryan to do that voodoo the he do much quicker.

GME...we win either way. Can't Stop. Won't Stop. Gamestop.

The charts are almost completely identical _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ How I paper-handed TWO 14-baggers in the past 60 days and why I wont let it happen again with VALE Every now and then I come across an options contract that has the perfect combination of penny pricing, high volume, and an excellent macro situation for the underlying company.  
  
Here are my missed plays because I was a scared little paper-handed bitch-  
ICLN missed 13-17 bagger - https://i.imgur.com/nOSNMs7.jpg  
APHA missed 14 bagger - https://i.imgur.com/tXpJ0tB.jpg  
  
  
Now here are the current options for VALE expiring 4/16 (with my current positions listed)- https://i.imgur.com/DpVVMYK.jpg  
  
These 30 cent options have the potential to become $3++ with the macro situation going on with metals (and the TSLA partnership as a wild card cherry on top).  
  
  
Why this feels the same to me- ICLN/APHA were both an obvious play when Biden won the presidency and everyone knew these stocks would rally the closer we got to the inauguration. STEEL stocks (and KMI with it's similar oil supply/demand situation) are also an obvious play with steel prices skyrocketing and Spring being the consensus among us as to when the stocks will really start to go parabolic. In spring people will look back and say damn we saw this coming just like the weed and clean energy traders now are saying damn we saw this coming.
  
  
I guess I just want to use this as an example of how STEEL HANDS can pay off. More importantly, it shows that you can literally wait for the DAY BEFORE expiration of the option to still have a 10-bagger on your hands.  
  
Hold the line and buy the fucking dip._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Absolutely life-changing. Why should I stop when its Gamestop? GME &#x200B;

Since people asked, here's a deeper dive into why I'm bullish on BBBY.

TLDR AND POSITIONS AT THE BOTTOM

# Overview

Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. and subsidiaries is an omnichannel retailer that sells a wide assortment of merchandise in the Home, Baby, Beauty and Wellness markets. It's subsidaries include Buy Buy Baby, Face Values, and Decoris.

# Leadership

      * digital first mindset with a BOPIS and free delivery
      * virtual rooms and improved ui to elevate customer experience
      * develop omni capabilities

# Turnaround Plan

* **Deepen Relations With Customers**
   * Retain and grow their **INCREASING** customer base with incentives and marketing
   * **Focus on their 5 segments in marketing**
      * the juggler, the innovator, the nester, the creative, and the minimizer
   * create **loyalty progams** to increase retention
* **Resetting Product Assortment**
   * Releasing BBBY's unique **private label brands** to penetrate the market and raise margin
   * increase the range of prices on products to invite lower spenders to the store
   * creating "destination rooms" to **elevate customer experience**
* **Offer competitive pricing**
   * BBBY wants to remain competitive in pricing while filling price gaps between products
   * **Study promotional data** to **maximize return** on coupons
* **Omnichannel**
   * Integrate physical locations with the digital setting
      * BOPIS (buy online pickup in store)
   * This will allow customers to venture into physical locations as well
* **Remodeling**
   * As stated earlier BBBY wants to **create customer friendly stores**
   * Currently, BBBY's stores look like ugly department stores and things are unaccessible
   * They are remodeling **450 stores over 3 years**
      * **the remodels are exactly what I wanted to see**
* **Creating stronger technology platform**
   * Better app and better website = more digital sales

As a BBBY shopper, **this addresses ALL my issues with the stores** atm.

As an investor, it's clear that **BBBY knows their audience and how they can regain market share and capitalize on their customers.**

Tritton clearly has a **GREAT vision** and **knows what he needs to do to** make it a reality.

REMEMBER this is a 3 year long plan, which means it will take time to fully come to fruition.

**If this is successful, BBBY will be a leader in the industry and the stock will reach highs unseen for years. With the leadership, I expect BBBY to successfully execute this plan, constantly top expectations, and prove the shorters wrong.**

# Q3 Financials

* **Profitability**
   * Profit margin is at a **historically high level of 35%**
      * **10% increase YoY** lead by lowered payroll, improved promo management, and product mix
   * SG&A **lowered** by 41 million
* **Cash Flow and EBITDA**
   * **Cash flow of 244 million** compared to a **negative** cash flow last year
   * EBITDA **growth of 168% from -.38 cents to .08 cents**
* **Comp and digital Sales**
   * For the first time in 6 years, BBBY is showing comparable sales growth in the last 2 quarters
   * **Digital sales up 94%**
   * In store traffic **decreasing**
* **Market Share**
   * For the first time in ages, BBBY saw market shares growth in the Home and kitchen departments
   * Reversal of a negative trend in other departments
* **Cash and Debt**
   * Cash is increasing to a solid 1.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents
   * debt lowered by 500 million (25%) this year
* **Revenue and Net income**
   * Revenue is DECREASING by 5% YoY
      * Tritton closed TONS of low performing stores and will continue to do so
      * also sold failing businesses
      * this will hurt total revenue but raise net income
   * Net Income is INCREASING
      * lower performing stores gone means higher profits

Yes, earnings missed estimates, but as Tritton said, **he is doing everything he said he would do.**

**The balance sheet is improving, he is executing his plan steadily, and he is overall reassuring investors with his buybacks.**

BBBY is focusing on optimizing their top performing stores as the country is over satured with stores currently. With unprofitable stores closing, **we can expect a decreasing overall revenue, but an increasing net income.**

As the plan continues, I fully expect overall revenue to **reverse the trend, and begin increasing.**

Investors were also disappointed with guidance, but **Tritton has mentioned that he is being CONSERVATIVE in estimates**. He has always one to be conservative and deliver more than expected.

# Tailwinds

* **Growing customer base**
* A general **shift towards home improvement**
* **New private label brands** are profitable and would help gain market share in 2021
* **150 stores** being remodeled in 2021
* **Stimulus** and perhaps more from Biden
* Return to "normal" would lead to a **large surge in marriages and babies**

# Headwinds

* COVID worsening and restrictions returning
* **Twitter trying to get BBBY cancelled for selling MyPillow**

# Buybacks

Normally, I am against share buybacks. BBBY used them previously to suppport a dying stock, but here it's different.

BBBY currently has an accelerated share repurchase program of 850  million dollars with 150 million to be repurchased by february 29th.

With excess cash from selling unprofitable businesses, **Tritton seeks to regain investor confidence WHILE producing obvious changes and results.**

Due to these buybacks, I expect share prices to grow over the next few months leading up to earnings.

# Short Interest

Currently, short interest is astronomically high at \~70%. I believe that this has decreased as a hedge fund bearish on GME and BBBY seems to have covered at the same time.

Check the spike on GME and BBBY 1/13 11:30. It's likely Melvin or mapleridge covered a short position.

With Cramer pumping and this, we saw a mild squeeze, **but there are no more catalysts to cause another for a while;** however, with buybacks and strong performance, shorters will slowly buy back their shares alongside BBBY, causing **a steady rise in price in the following months.**

**If the turnaround plan is successful, shorts will have no reason to remain bearish, and BBBY will grow exponentially in price over the next 6-12 months.**

# Conclusion

**Bed Bath and Beyond is on the road to success.**

**As a consumer, their private label brands, store remodels, and specialized marketing changes are exactly what I want to see.**

**In a growing industry, strong leadership, buybacks, and a beautiful turnaround plan make me bullish on BBBY.**

**I do NOT expect growth akin to what happened this week, but expect strong growth as the sentiment towards BBBY changes and their plan succeeds over the next few months.**

# I am bullish on BBBY and will be until Tritton leaves

# TLDR

Tritton will take us to the moon. Calls for the brave (dated far out), shares for the weak.

Great leadership, good plan, good industry 🚀🚀🚀🚀🌚🌚🌚🌚🌚

Get ready for a potential overdue golden age for the nuclear energy industry, including but not limited to nuclear power plants and you guessed it: uranium.


**Let’s dig in deeper**

**Why Nuclear?**

Nuclear reactors generate virtually emissions-free power which means they can form a part of getting to net-zero emissions from electricity generation in the fight to tackle global warming.

**I thought nuclear equals bad?**

Unless you’ve been living under a rock, being green and sustainable is hot. There are currently no safe or clean ways to generate the amount of sustainable energy that nuclear does. Also, as the world population grows, unless there are giant leaps im technology, the only viable way to create enough power will be through a combination of nuclear, solar, wind and water.

**Biden’s administration has a $400 billion dollar sustainable energy proposal and it includes nuclear** 

This is rare. What’s even more rare is that he’s one of the only presidents to run on a platform *supporting advancement in nuclear energy.* He is serious about it. 

**That’s right, there’s a reason EVs mooned last year and will continue to do well for the foreseeable future. It’s the same reason there is potential for it to happen to the nuclear industry:**

https://www.tdworld.com/utility-business/article/21151832/president-bidens-vision-for-the-power-sector

**”But I’m republican. I can’t agree with Sleepy Joe...”**

You’re in luck! This is something so appealing that everyone and their racist grandma can hold hands and sing Kumbaya on. Bipartisan political handoff shows this is an opportunity area that even politicians can agree to. 

https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/energy/trump-boost-to-nuclear-power-to-live-on-in-biden-administration%3f_amp=true


**Even Nuclear industry folks seem highly positive in their world which has been fear mongered and neglected for decades:**

*"Things we've seen out of the Biden campaign and the transition team are very promising for a continuation and even acceleration of programs and policies that will support nuclear energy," said John Kotek, policy development vice president for the Nuclear Energy Institute*

LAC is up 16.9% AH and over 250% for the past 30 days, since I wrote a previous [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ke3hxz/lac_yet_another_bull_run_into_2021/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf), telling you that this will run up again. (That post was probably killed because mkt cap was barely $1B at the time)

I’m not here to say you should’ve listened to me. I’m here to tell you that this will fly higher and probably end up with a huge partnership with...yes, Tesla, because the mine is next door from the Gigafactory and it’s the biggest in the 🇺🇸, making it independent from foreign Lithium sources.

There will be dips. Buy ‘em. This thing is gonna make people rich. Even shares should 10x, and much shittier companies have been worth $25B. 

This one is not about lithium, by the way. Other lithium plays (LTHM, PLL, STLHF) are flat. This is about LAC.

&#x200B;

I think that it's time to slowly invest into or continually investing for pure GAINS

We know that Cathie Wood's ARK Next Generation Internet ETF bought 497,100 shares of Palantir.

link: [https://www.thestreet.com/investing/palantir-pltr-stock-ark-next-generation-internet-etf](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/palantir-pltr-stock-ark-next-generation-internet-etf)

&#x200B;

With Palantir opening a contract with the military and the government we can see that Woods is trying to invest more of the company into her Index ETF

&#x200B;

So what makes you think that Palantir stocks will go up fairly soon? 3 catalysts

1. **Announced in Dec. 17th Demonstration Day (link provided) ON JANURAY 26TH**

Will be showing off their AI Software; Gotham, Foundry, Apollo

[https://investors.palantir.com/news-details/2020/Palantir-Announces-Inaugural-Live-Demo-Day-on-January-26-2021/default.aspx](https://investors.palantir.com/news-details/2020/Palantir-Announces-Inaugural-Live-Demo-Day-on-January-26-2021/default.aspx)  we'll see  what they have to offer which should beef up their stock for a bit

&#x200B;

2.**Palantir will be announcing their Q4 Earnings date around FEB 11th** 

which should show how well they're doing

&#x200B;

3. **There is a share lock-up** (meaning that a lot 60-80% of their shares are owned by insiders, CEOs, employees, etc) which means that we'll see that ends probably around mid-February where we can see a giant dip due to those people selling their shares for the profits they've seen from the market

&#x200B;

However, after that happens I do believe that the prices will float back up by March/April

&#x200B;

Watch this video if you didn't understand

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KiKi4qIJ2sg&t=208s&ab\_channel=saltypeanuts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KiKi4qIJ2sg&t=208s&ab_channel=saltypeanuts)

&#x200B;

Prediction; pick up Palantir stocks and watch them go up before/after their demonstration I would say prepare calls around (27.5 - 29c)  for the week of 29TH  and around Feb 11th.

🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Once the lockup period happens I'm sure we'll see some dips and that'll be more chances to buy into the dip as well as redo more options

&#x200B;

TLDR: watch the video

I heard this is the formula for tendies _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ There's another reason we can 💎 🙌 other than our massive 🍒. [GME] Hello fellow retards. It's been quite the ride watching our collective cognitive dysfunction butt blast Smelvin Capital. And it's going to feel even better when we finish inside them as well. Something though that I want to bring up since it's being asked a lot especially by our newly self-diagnosed autists, and that is although this thing is on the verge of exploding any day now, the ball is FUNDAMENTALLY in our court. When people ask you not to be a single-ply handed bitch and to dump your grandparents' retirement accounts into more shares, they're not doing it because they want to pump themselves. It's because there is no running cost to owning a share. Obviously there is potential downside and opportunity loss from other tasty FDs (even though, who are we kidding? this sub has probably had the highest return rate ever this week with everyone not gifting away their money to thetagang). But on the short's side there's a short lending premium, which because of the damage our relentless banging of our heads against the wall has caused, has recently exploded and is probably the reason why some risk dude at Melvin who doesn't even hang out with his wife's boyfriend is drinking himself to sleep every night. 


The only thing these evil fucks have is deep pockets. And they will use every penny they have to scare us, thinking all these extra shorts will eventually come back to them. But what they don't know is that there are more zeroes in our collective negative IQ than there are in their accounts. So no matter what happens, I want to see AN ABSOLITE GORILLA APE LEVEL OF DIAMOND HANDED RETARDATION from you because if you're holding shares YOU LITERALLY HAVE NOTHING TO LOSE compared to them (especially that this is a good LONG hold anyways with RC for the next year or two minimum).



Here's some shit they're throwing at us so let's sling some right back at them.

* Buy shares in cash if you can not on margin to minimize lending potential and even the very unlikely margin calling when shit hits the fan.

* Set up sky high limit sell stops which also can deter your cuck broker from lending your shares out. 

* I want the only time you even look at the sell button is if because of all the digits now in your position, the buy button has been PUSHED OFF YOUR SCREEN.

* If you ever feel your appendages start to feel itchy and papyraceous, realize that any natural catalysts like good news from RC or any retarded organic bullish sentiments would blast this gasoline truck out of the atmosphere.

TLDR: You're being asked to carry a school bag sitting in chair and just to outlast the biggest asshole you've known in you're life who found himself strapped with weights running up a mountain instead of what he thought would be downhill stroll at the expense of working class people.

A while ago I started mixing unusual options activity into my ~~gambling~~investing.  At first I lost a shitload of money chasing dumbass whales with zero plan, but now I actually have a pretty good feel for it.  I still fuck up alot, but more often I do not fuck up.  This is to help those of you who want to start chasing whales, or are at a basic level and want to do it better.

I'm using some plays from this week as examples because they are fresh in my mind and I have a couple screenshots.

**Tools**
I use barchart in tandem with Unusual Whales. For barchart, you can honestly get by using their free version, you just can't sort as well.  They have a free month trial too.  I also pay the 20 bucks for Unusual Whales to confirm what I scan, and they have a good stocks volume standard deviation tool.  I have zero affiliation to either, just saying what I use.

There are way more technical ways to do this, but I like to use my eyes to scan sporadically throughout the day like a boomer.

**Basic Concept**
Long story short, you're ideally chasing the options purchases of what are, presumably, deep-pocketed individuals or institutions.  UOA identifies certain options contract orders that are higher than the average daily contract order.  For example, if the average daily option volume on an GME weekly is 4,000, and an option order enters for 4,000 or higher, it's flagged as unusual activity since it's a multiple of that daily average volume--sometimes it shows as multiple orders if "they" push through a few smaller purchases that produce heavy volume.

MM are sneks who like to move in silence, which they can do with with stock positions via dark pools and the like.  However, they can't get away with that with options activity--it all shows.  That fact, young autist, is your slingshot against the institutional goliath.

**Hunting the Whale**
So I've got my unusual options activity page open on barchart or wherever for the current day.  I adjust the expiration date option so that the options I'm looking at don't expire past a couple weeks out (more on why later), then I'm ready to eye scan.

I typically start by looking for **one of two things: 1) large clusters of orders that belong to one ticker  or 2) sporadic orders for a ticker that consistently show up over a couple hours, but belong to non-hot, non-meme stonks that do NOT have earnings imminent.**  To make sure I'm looking at something potentially weird, I choose to exclude options that expire more than a couple weeks out.

**1) Clusters of orders—ABNB example**
The way I scope it is kind of a tiered process.  *First*, I'm looking to see if there are any clusters of orders that catch my eye on a quick scan.  *Second*, I'm looking to see if those clusters of orders contain both calls AND puts, with some OTM activity and spreads preferred.  *Third*, I look to see if the number of seperate call orders outweighs the number of put orders (or vice versa), and additionally I look to see if the volume of the calls drastically outweighs the volume of the puts (or vice versa).  

**Why?  Because it helps you determine if the options order is just a hedge, or if it’s hedging against itself as it’s own positio**n. This is super important so try to follow along-- most UOA is just institutions hedging; Mr. MM has a nice, busy life and fancy yacht and can't just exit his positions back and forth all day like a WSBer.  He also has like a billion shares of his stonks, so if he dumps it when he's got paper hands it will siginficantly tank the value and cause a ripple effect.  So, *instead* of hedging by dumping his shit, he hedges by adding OTM options against his position--next level fucking diamond hands.  That would be the type of whale order from Mr. MM we don't want to follow.  *But*, if Mr. MM buys 4,000 FB call options in a few blocks, and you see like 1,000 in FB puts go through right alongside it, the odds are that someone is betting big on FB and using the puts as a hedge, since the puts represent a smaller volume in the call/put ratio.  Instead of the options being a hedge for a bigger stock position they hold, these types of option clusters indicate that the option order itself is the big, independent play, and it's hedging itself with lower volume order vs the higher volume (4,000 calls to 1,000 puts).

**Then I do an easy confirmation**.  I check the tickers general trend the past week or so in a chart, do a news search on twitter of their ticker for news catalysts and sentiment, and google and YouTube to see if the crayola kids think it's a good nerd play.

**Example**: Here's the screenshot on some ABNB UOA I noticed and played this week.  It went to 200% and change within a couple hours, but I had unfortunate diamond hands and sold for about half that.

[ABNB UOA](https://i.imgur.com/mYDXYmN.jpg)

So, this a softball.  **First**, you can see that ABNB all of a sudden explodes with all these options showing up at 12:52–that's our cluster.  **Second**, the clusters have both calls and puts in that minute timespan, with some put orders showing at the bottom of the cluster.  Some of the calls are deep OTM, as far as 200c.  **Third**, the call orders far outweigh the put orders in both amount and volume.  *Awwwww shit, looks like we got more than a hedge—we’re onto something.*

**Confirmation time**: ABNB had been on a general uptrend, and I typically don't like to chase, but I combed twitter and saw their were rumors of the CEO speaking the following day, and that news had just broken of their DC booking cancellations.  I looked back into the morning, and saw a few more unusual blocks, and a few more rolled in just after the cluster pictured above.

Passed the smell test.  Options bought, tendies gained.

**Sparse Orders: SNAP example**

The same principles can apply to orders on tickers that pop up individual orders, not large clusters,  which **a) haven’t had much attention b) have been on a steep downtrend—this makes the order unusual, and/or c) seem to keep popping up in single orders over a few hours to a day.**The same principles as above apply, but if you see these types of orders with very little time left until expiration, you can assume assume it's probably not a hedge.  SNAP isn't the best example of the week because there wasn't a put order in this block.  But, there was positive TA sentiment when I searched, SNAP had been on an oversold downtrend, and I don't have screenshots left of the better ones I saw and went after.  **Plus, importantly, IT WAS TOWARDS THE END OF THE DAY** (this is huge, EOD is prime time for AH news whales)

[SNAP UOA](https://i.imgur.com/GGr5bra.jpg)

A better example from this week though is SPCE, which had only a few orders sprinkled throughout the day, and one toward the end of the day which was DEEP, DEEP OTM expiring 1/15.  **That’s a flag for us—sporadic listing throughout the day, OTM toward the end of the day. ** BAM! EOD SPCE OTM calls sprinkle in, ARK invests to kick off AH, SPCE moons. 

**Sparse Orders Patterns: Connecting the dots on tech rebound with FB and SNAP**

Seeing the SNAP orders above sharpened my eyes that day to looking for a pattern with tech on the whole, since big tech had been so royally gaped the past week.  I kept seeing FB options like this pop up

[https://i.imgur.com/muVGtq2.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/T54peER.jpg)

Sometimes you can put together sporadic listings and create a working theory based on a sector.  Because this and similar FB orders were deep OTM and one day out, I knew there was a risk they could a hedge, but also knew that the tech sector was due for a rebound and saw SNAP posting sporadic OTM as well.  **So, I bought my options for each of those two another week out and closer to ATM (important, more below), to give the whale some breathing room** in case was it was a hedge, even though the technicals agreed with the bounce.  The whales were right, and it was an easy little overnight profit.


**How I’ve Fucked Up 1: Don’t get tricked by trends**

Although we like to believe institutions are ahead of the curve, often they are just trend-riding lemmings who follow what's already way, way up.  They buy the top, just like WSB tardies such as yourself specialize in.  So, when you see shit like this below, take a minute to think before you get excited:

[NIO UOA LIKE THIS WAS NONSTOP](https://i.imgur.com/JCZBx2s.jpg)

It was the same for all the memes: PLUG, FCEL, MARA, and RIOT all week, dominating the orders.  If something is already too popular, just stay away from it.  You can ride something up, but when you see massive orders on shit that's already like 400% IV, just...don't.

**How I’ve Fucked Up 2: DO give the MM’s some breathing room**

*Even if you’re confident in a move you see that is a few days out, extend your play a week or two further out minimum, and strike it closer to ATM.*  If you can't do either of those things because you can't afford the premium just skip that play and check back for something new later; I promise a better opportunity will arise.  You can recover from bagholding, but you cannot recover from blowing your account on an incorrect 0DTE.

Breathing room is also important because often whales will have the news but not the exact timing.  Two months ago I followed a DDOG whale on a Thursday 1DTE that expired worthless the next day.  The following Monday (1 trade day later) DDOG made the announcement that rocketed them like 20%--if I'd given them a week's breathing room, it would've been a 15 bagger.  Fucking F.

**So, to review:** look for order clusters or sporadic ticker orders that a) have a mix of calls and puts with one dominating the other b) unpopular tickers that have deep OTM or close expirations c) always check chatter afterward and fundamentals and d) try to put together a narrative of things that are related that catch your eye (this Monday's EV run or this Friday's tech bounce could be next week's airline dominance or cruiseline craze--connect the dots).  Initially look for options expiring soon, as they indicate the most riskiness--and therefore confidence--if the MM is not hedging.  Shop with a short term eye, buy with a long term choice. 

**10 Things That Will Help You Not GUH:**

**1)** Monday and Friday morning/afternoon are the most accurate whale times, according to data from Unusual Whales

**2)** If you don't have PDT always save some spending power for EOD shopping

**3**) If you don't have PDT never, ever follow a whale with a weekly.  Sometimes the news the whale bets on is a 'sell the news' event, and you won’t recover from a drop especially if there is IV crush involved. 

**4)** Always give the whale breathing room by purchasing an expiration at least a week further out

**4b**) Always give the whale breathing room by going closer to ATM strikes than theirs

**5)** Sign up for barchart monthly trial (then continue it) and unusual whales--they're each like 20 bucks and thats way less than you spend on an FD. 

**6**) You don't need to learn TA, but you need to check technicals on the tickers you want to chase--almost every major ticker has youtubers or fintwits giving their daily or weekly TA.  This way you know if it's a proper breakout happening if the whale hits, and you're not just guessing at when to take profits.  Remember, whales can buy wayyyyyyy OTM and sell for massive profit at any point--they *aren’t* bagholding a call until it's in the money like you are. You may be 10% up waiting for the next 80% GME day while your whale has sold at their target 5% profits on the play and is chillin. 

**7**) Leave at least 10% of your account spending power free each day.  I promise, the one time you go full boat you will see the most obvious whale play at the end of the day.  Then you won't be able to do shit about it and you'll hate yourself when it's a 10 bagger overnight.  Trust me.

**8**) Make sure the ticker you're chasing isn't just ER anticipation/bets.  Always check earnings dates before buying.

**9**) Remember whales are people, so they can be stupid, too.  Don't baghold a position that is clearly fucked for some news that looks unlikely to come.  They are gambling addicts just like you, except they have more money.

**10**) Always take profits if you ask yourself if it's time to.  If it's good enough to screenshot, it's good enough to close the position.

**Positions**:
Dumped a ton of stuff and loading up Tuesday because long weekends scare me, but saw some ineresting 2/5s I held including

WKHSc
PLTRc
SPYc (1/19, 1/22)
LMNDp

And a couple tickers that I couldn’t post lol.  also have AAPL and JD leaps

***

TLDR
Use a service to follow whales so you can get ahead of announcements.  Look for clusters of options activity that hedge themselves via call/put ratio, and do a legitimate check for TA and catalysts to confirm their moves.  Never follow a whale into a weekly, but use weeklies are your best screener.

***

*I might do a pretty consistent DD post (a couple times a week) on what I’m seeing at the end of each day if there is interest, and if it’s not a day I don’t have a ton of real work.  If something quick catches my eye I usually throw it up on my twitter @yourboymilt (there’s no notification thing on here mods, just trying to be helpful— not selling anything) I’ll also probably throw some more potential Monday positions on here over the weekend once I decide to do some more research.

Cramer on the other hand only bandwagon inside of the Tesla after it took off. Now he is saying he doesn’t understand what Palantir does.

Palantir makes it easy for government workers who mostly are not tech bros to find correlation in data points. If you've ever worked for the government, you'll know they do not have macbook pro's, VSCode,  jupyter notebook, or any of that fancy FOSS or SaaS software 🚀   They are mostly use what is issued to them or default on the desktop - Dell laptops,\~\~ internet explorer\~\~ microsoft edge, and what ever software they are contracted with 🚀  Palantir makes it so you didn't have graduate in cs or data science or learn python/sql to use their software.

Government deals with annual budgets 🚀   It wouldn't surprise me if these contracts get renewed time and time again to utilize the maximum budget 🚀  

There are many more use cases for Palantir, not just in defense or law enforcement 🚀  It is also being used to track the current pandemic🚀 It can be used in a range of different industries🚀

Palantir expects to boost that to $1 billion this year based on a Bloomberg report🚀 Palantir is growing. I rather be invested in a growing company than one that has already reached its peak🚀

I'm sitting here in my retard palace reflecting on how my idea of the market has changed since I dove into this sub right around the beginning of last year. I first visited WSB a couple years ago but was quickly overwhelmed with all the abbreviations and inside jokes. At the time I dismissed it as a nihilistic financial-prank hellhole where people with nothing to lose YOLO'd their money away and that it was encouraged and that everyone was just trying to throw away their money. While that does happen obviously, I think there's a much bigger macro-vision of this sub that is changing things forever in the market.

In my opinion, nothing demonstrates this macro-vision better than the narrative surrounding GME. To have a talking head that my dad would watch when I was a kid continue to reference this sub on TV and say that we're in control is insane. At the same time, this exposure could be a death sentence. We are in a precarious situation now where the volume of users here really makes us a stupidly strong retail entity if we all choose to rally behind something. It's cool, but it's also a liability. The number of braindead questions that have flooded the daily threads since the GME rally began has been immense, and that's only counting the comments that made it through whatever automatic filters the mods set up here. Because of this volume, it's going to increase our exposure to the media exponentially. There have already been tons of articles written about WSB, but none of them have gotten to the point of putting on the blame for something financially devastating. With the influence we have over the market (at least when there's an agreed upon general sentiment here) it's only a matter of time until we upset the wrong suit on Wall Street and they try to see what they can do to fuck up the operation here.

I hope it doesn't come to that because I really do think the camaraderie here is something special. On first visit it seemed like a mean, uninviting place, but what I've realized is that people do look out for each other here. When someone does something 'retarded' like take every cent to their name and put it into weeklies, they get called retarded (because they are), but they'll also get comments like 'no one has ever lost money taking a profit' when it's time to go. There's a bond over degenerate lack-of-financial-responsibility, but it's all in the name of pursuing financial independence in a brute-force manner and attempting to stand up to a system that has never shown much care for those not deemed worthy to be a part of it.

I know there's a flip side to all of this. There's the idea of gambling addiction, the idea that you see a lot more people post about their wins than losses, confirmation bias, and that a lot of people won't make it out the other end with a profit, but that goes for most systems in life. It still feels great to see someone here find the life they never thought they could have, buy that car, provide for that family member, etc. And maybe it doesn't last or they test their luck and lose their gains, but no one ever said we weren't retarded.

Point is...All eyes are on us, especially after all the TSLA gains last year. We will see how the GME chapter unfolds this year, but it is undeniable that the media exposure and influence this sub holds is only going to increase, and with that there's a lot to consider amongst ourselves as to what the primary tone and function of this space is. To not anticipate hordes of normies and suited wall-streeters continuing to infiltrate the space is to underestimate the growth that will take place whether we want it to or not. I believe, when we look back on it in the future, that this chapter of WSB began last year around the crash in March, but there's no denying it's a new chapter nonetheless. It's only gonna get crazier.

They are one of the best bang for your buck companies in the sector. 3.5b in revenue and the market cap is only 3b with a p/e of 15. Market cap at 1 times revenue!!! Like seriously wtf is that.   

Biden is going to invest in environmental, social and governance sector which means there will be a huge payout for solar. Tax creds and tariff reductions baby. CSIQ already announced US largest PV and battery storage without a peep from the market. Methinks it’s cuz everyone on SPWR FSLR RUN and whatever other solar company with p/e 40+’s nuts. Fuck those guys  

And people be like “Canadian solar is actually backed by China and has no exposure to US”. To those people I say fucky fuckity fuck you duck. CSIQ is a global company with a subsidiary called Recurrent Energy which just sold a huge project in Cali.

Along with that, people been bankin on EV and that bubble bout to bust. However people still want a hand in clean energy or just green renewable companies in general. My guess is that these autists will rotate over to the solar sector which due for a massive pump like 2015-2016.

2. The real big bucks are flowing towards Palantir with long/short term million dollar contracts.. and ya'll bought BB out of the grave.
3. Citron punched PLTR first, then came Credit Sussie, then Morgan Stanley.... recently Citi... and ya'll had to show them your paper hands. PLTR is a diamond which needs the same. Big guys trying to downplay the stock till the next financials come in. Thats where they get in, and you keep watching the stock price go up. Obvious cue ignored.
4. Just like TSLA is backed by a CEO trying to change world conventions of commuting, energy and space travel. PLTR is the revolution of how corporations would strategize and optimize their existing pipelines! Still ya'll selling shares and buying puts. Obvious cue ignored.
5. Ya'll profited big time out of GME and BB. But, do you really even consider or plan to stay? Doesn't PLTR look like an obvious place to dump your gains?
6. Specifically for you "simple men" looking for 🚀- Alex Karp's entire life makes papa Musk's dance look normal.. and ya'll putting your bucks into GME and BB? Isn't Alex Karp's hair style enough for you to YOLO your life savings into PLTR?

A few weeks ago, I posted some DD when they were trading at $23 and some retards said it will fall harder to $15. As always, 🏳️‍🌈🧸 get fucked. 




Virgin Galactic has had a rocky past - 15 year company with not much to show for it. But in this past year, we had SPAC rockstar Chamath breath fresh life into the venture. Here is why SPCE will win in 2021. 


1. Public financing is helping the company ramp up their engineering efforts. Their test pilots are certified Air Force badasses. They are ready for take off 🚀🚀🚀🚀





2. Mama Cathy announced a new ARKX space etf which is very likely to hold shares of SPCE. That news alone sent us up 20% and we don’t even have a launch date. 




3. In an interview about his recently passed mother Eve, Sir Richard made an off hand (likely accidental) comment about being proud to fly to space in a ship named after his mother *in the next 2-3 months*



4. Branson is the OG mementrepreneur. He’s been doing this since the 70s and owns an island. When he goes to space with Justin Bieber and Ashton Kutcher, we’ll be in (sub) orbit 🚀🚀🚀🚀



5. The CEO was a top Disney exec. He understands the power of scale and pricing. His goal is to eventually bring prices down to $10,000. So if any of you tards plan on still being alive in 2040 and want to go to space for cheap, it’s in your best interest to support the company




6. “But what about SpaceX!? Elon is king and I want his hot load in my mouth!! Branson is a BOOOOMER!” Ok...SpaceX and VG operate in very different markets. And you all are poor degenerates so it’s not like you can even buy pre-IPO shares anyways. VG is the best play for someone who wants to invest in a company that will bring space to the masses. Also, a Musk-Branson collab is very likely if SPCE takes off. They are not direct competitors and will be huge PR boost to both. That should satisfy all your Elon boners



7. The ticker is literally SPCE, what more DD do you fuckers need? 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🍆💦




Some retards are saying that it is not profitable and will not be able to turn a profit in possibly 10 years. Reminds me of another stonk that people laughed at 10 years ago.

Clean energy stocks down a lot (ICLN -5.39%, TAN -7.24%, QCLN -5.57%). Is the bull market for them over? Is it going to trade down or sideways this year? Why did the market react so harshly to the lack of talk about clean energy? Was it an overreaction or the beginning of a larger term trend for the rest of the year? Classic buy the rumor, sell the news?

Yesterday's stimulus plan is only the first of two major spending initiatives Biden will seek in the first few months of his presidency.

The second bill, expected in February, will tackle the president-elect’s longer-term goals of creating jobs, reforming infrastructure, combating climate change and advancing racial equity.

Surely the hedge funds and very smart money must have known his other bill was going to be the one talking about infrastructure. 

Was everyone just in it for the euphoria and trend and got out today? Is everyone anticipating the clean energy spending will go nowhere, similar to how not much happened with Obama's infrastructure plan? 

What caused the drop, was it hedge funds or retail investors bailing?

Such a big decline the day after surely must signal something? 

Should holders of clean energy stocks get out now or ride it out?
