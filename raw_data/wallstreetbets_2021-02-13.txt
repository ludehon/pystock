 No tendies for valentines _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ I am financially ruined (agricultural blackberry futures) I have lost everything, and I'm not sure how to continue. This winter I invested $17,500 (six months salary and my entire life savings) into agricultural blackberry futures, hoping to capitalize on this lucrative emerging industry. After watching a video about David H. Murdock, CEO of Dole, and his pseudo-monopoly over bananas, I decided to do something similar with another fruit. I did some research and found out many agricultural forecasters expected this year's blackberry yield would be smaller than the past, due to deteriorating soil conditions in Central Mexico and a colder-than-average spring. At first, demand soared around the middle of January and prices skyrocketed, but the blackberry bubble burst on on January 28th. Unfortunately, the recent concerns over high-flying stocks driven up by large short covering caused a massive drop-off in demand due to the futures being associated with a Canadian technology company of the same name, and prices plummeted. I had invested early enough that I thought I would still be fine, but then on the morning of February 8th, a new email in my inbox caused my stomach to turn into a pretzel. The massive blackberry shipment from the Mexican state of Jalisco, scheduled for early May, had arrived. I was planning on selling off my futures right before this, in March, but this ruined everything. To top it off, the blackberries in this shipment were absolutely gargantian, some topping 20 grams each, causing the price-per-pound to drop like an anchor into the range of 6 cents per kilo. I am ruined._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Barry is a FREQ Hi Retardos and Retarditas,

This is the 2nd or 3rd time I'm posting about the sexiest stonk out there right now in my opinion.

Stonk is called Frequency Therapeutics and Barry loves this stonk (proof below)

This is still the ground floor (1.7bn ish market cap) of a company that seems to be far along in the Progenitor Cell activation. Their first endeavor is solving hearing loss for which there are no good alternatives right now (hearing aids dont work for shi) followed by MS. For all you bald aholes out there, don't worry, they will eventually get to you once they solved real issues.

They have an allstar cast at the company including Dr.Langer who is one of the most accomplished scientists in the US. 

My 98% of my portfolio overweight in this bad boy and I believe it's going to be a double win. I'm more interested in them restoring the lives of people truly struggling with hearing loss and tinnitus but I'm also interested in making tendies so that with my new and improved hearing, I can listen to my wife being taken care of by her boyfriend.

TLDR: I like this stonk. Barry likes this stonk. it's a FREQ

The denial; the never stop analysis on 'what went wrong'; the what-ifs; the crying of the injustice that caused the break up; the fantasy of its miracle come back to your arms.

You know you never meant to be falling in love with a stock ticker on WSB? While you are still jerking off to the best sex you ever had on Jan 28 when the share price reached $420.69, hoping you'll experience it again, others have been in and out of silver, weeds, crypt$ miners, SPACs, electric cars, defense contractors, making tendies or losing their shirts.

Just wipe the tears off and move the fuck on. Never fall in love on WSB. This is a casino in a Wendy's. Stop feeling sorry and go make some fucking money._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Don't be late! MasterCard makes huge announcement Listen up fellow autists, I've been talking with your wife's boyfriends and there is a large play going on behind the scenes with companies like $MA. I know reading and comprehension is a challenge on this sub but I believe in [some of] you. TLDR at the bottom for the true apes among us.

What the f** is $MA doing talking with CleanSpark- a <1billion market cap, relatively small company? A company that is by all intents and purposes in the energy sector. CleanSpark Inc focuses on solving modern energy challenges. They focus on software solutions that provide energy modeling, energy market communications, and energy management solutions. Okay, and what does that have to do with XBT or $MA?

They own ATL Data Centers, which mines, encrypts, and enables the use of the XBT and other currencies alike. This is HUGE for $MA as just last week they announced a plan to incorporate 'other currencies' into the companies current global business model.

**The company’s XBT mining segment brought in 32% of total revenue last year and is growing RAPIDLY. This XBT segment ALONE brought in 115-150million last year versus the 30 million expected because of the new processing capacity they have for mining -modern problems require modern solutions. CleanSpark reported an extremely strong and unexpected quarter. With quarterly revenue of 2.26 million, an increase of 130% from .98 million for the prior year.**

This is not a pump and dump. This is not a game to be played. Fellow autists, we are on the cusp of an XBT revolution. CleanSpark has earning reports coming up on 2/23. You will see a jump. You will diamond hand it and you will thank me later.

TLDR: CleanSpark (find the ticker yourself) is a hidden stock that has already posted a 130%+ gain from last year from their efforts to be at the forefront of XBT in a global economy ANS they are working with $MA to incorporate XBT, which would make $MA the WORLDS FIRST global financial service business to incorporate XBT into their business plan.

The time is among us. The future is here. Don't let your wife's boyfriend take your tendies again._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ I think WSB is Playing GME WRONG I see most of you are probably playing STOCKS rather than options but the irony of this strategy is that WSB or the retail does NOT have enough collateral to actually force the stock price to go up.

At most the retail can bring the price up like $5 judging by the price action last week. And the shorts have been fucking with options for 2 fucking weeks because they can't do anything with dried up shares.

Only way to fuck shorts now with retail buying power?

OPTIONS.

That's why I sold half of my shares and bought FD(options expiring very soon) CALLS

Go to [r/stocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/) if you want to hold your fucking shares

We initially started to have explosive price actions at +$70 and $100.

That's because there was a fuckt ton of demand in OTM call options for GME. about 100k+ in OTM CALL options.

Don't know what gamma squeeze or options are? Let me give you a ELI5 version

Gamma squeeze = big money buying a shit ton of shares to cover their asses from selling call options to you.

Call options = you make x10 more of your money than holding shares but higher risks are involved.

Basically the more call options we hold the more MMs will have to buy up already dried up shares.

If you have no idea about options watch this video /watch?v=CRhGikRHSu8 and educate yourself. You will become very rich if you play it right.

DISCLAIMER: OPTIONS ARE HIGH RISK HIGH REWARD._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $GTHX is making massive gains in absolute silence and there are definitely a lot more to be made I have seen very few posts or talk about $GTHX across all of the stock-related subs and I’m completely shocked due to how successful this company has been in the last year, specifically the last three months, and *even more specifically* just yesterday. I’ll keep this short and sweet for you retards and I encourage you to do your own DD as I just want to get the word out there with this post:

**G1 Therapeutics ($GTHX)** is a biopharmaceutical company developing some really fucking innovative drugs for cancer treatment. This isn’t two cross-eyed joe-schmoes in their garage getting government funding to shake up some test tubes of their own piss, they’re actually getting shit done. The FDA *just approved* a major drug ([Here’s the article—groundbreaking stuff](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fda-approves-g1-therapeutics-cosela-004100120.html)) in their pipeline just yesterday and hardly ANYONE is talking about it, but $GTHX STILL shot up 20% after hours on Friday, and probably will make huge gains on Tuesday when others catch wind of it. This drug is going to start being distributed in *less than a month*, their earnings report is at the end of this month, and if their breast cancer drug ends up getting approved in a few months as well, I think we are going to see an even bigger boom than what I’m expecting on Tuesday. Did I mention they’re up 145% in the last three months, and nearly 65% in the last month alone? 
  
I’m expecting big things from $GTHX and encourage others to do their own research and see if they’re seeing the same thing I am: major potential. This is now my biggest position and I’m excited to see what comes next for them.  
  
*Not investment advice etc etc etc make your own informed decisions you know the drill*

Good company, good stuff going for them, look into it._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ ELDORADO GOLD, going for Gold ($EGO the play for March) EGO is a canadian miner that has gone through a lot the last few years. Two main mines one in Turkey (drying up) and one in Greece (skouries) have been in trouble for a various reasons. The skouries project  was brought to a halt mainly for environmental reasons and opposition from the previous government.

&#x200B;

EGO is undervalued and currently trading at 13 dollars.

Although EGO performed well during 2020, it has underperformed since 2017. GDX has been up 167% while EGO has is sitting at the same price compared to 4 years ago.

A recent agreement was signed with the greek government week before last that renewed the contract for the skouries and olympias project. This caused the stock price to only jump roughly 12%. When the contract was suspended in 2015, there was a 50% drop.

&#x200B;

Book price is $20

What's the play here? In the next three weeks the new contract will pass through the greek parliament.  If it is indeed ratified, then I do expect a run to 20 fairly soon.  The positive sentiment for metals helps as well.

&#x200B;

There is also a rumor in the street that Newmont ($NEM) may offer a friendly acquisition at $21 if the contract passes through the greek parliament. Eldorado desperately needs more cash for the new project.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

# EDIT: The day the contract was signed by the greek government and EGO, apart from the minister and EGO CEO, two other people attended. One was the Canadian ambassador and the other one was the American ambassador.

# 

# EGO is a Canadian company. Newmont is American. There is a rumor about a buyout. What the hell the American ambassador was doing there?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The main play is not the rumor but the ratification of the contract from the greek parliament

Positions: 13c exp 02/19. I will rollover to March and now looking at 18c. If there is an acquisition, EGO will moon

&#x200B;

TL:DR High risk high reward. Buy EGO calls expiring March, if skouries projects passes through parliament  EGO will moon. If Newmont offers byout it will explode and you'll be going to tendietown_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ TSLA is the only EV company outside of China that’s selling cars rn—Volkswagen is faking its numbers.

R/TSLALounge (the new Tesla Investors Club) user /u/Time_Commercial_7342 did good work and found some Twitter person that, through napkin math, has made a pretty fucking persuasive case for VW faking it’s ID3 numbers.

Why is this important? Tesla continues to dominate every sector of the EV market. If VW can’t sell the ID3, then who the fuck has a prayer of competing? 

Every car Tesla sells is another candidate for Fsd take (100% profit margin), premium connectivity, Tesla insurance, and future entertainment options. FSD and insurance are going to be paired— use of the former will reduce the cost of the latter, providing a massive incentive to go all in

TLDR

Diamond hand those shares no matter what happens. Nobody enters the hall of the gods and feasts until the end of time unless they die with their Tesla shares in their hand. 

TO VALHALLA_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Institutional strategy games with stocks. Game objectives: Build a base on the moon to travel to mars! GME; AMC This is a scenario or a playbook how institutional investors could try to fuck shorty. It just came to my mind and maybe some of you would like to discuss:

If you want to go to mars you will likely first install some base facilities on the moon to prepare your starships for mars. This is a possible playbook to go to mars.   

At the moment it seems like there is some kind of a standoff situation between institutional shorts and longs.

Most of you probably noticed a tweet from an investment company saying: Stay the course? At the same time they heavily increased their positions in AMC.

GME on the other side left a lot of burned ground and is in special interest now because of the hearing and such. So you probably should not try to take this rocket to the moon for the moment. But some say it already made it to the moon, so perhaps it just needs some refueling to become a starship further explore our solar system?

However, if you are an institutional investor you have to think strategic, right? Here is the big what if:

WHAT IF, you are an institutional investor and decide you want to go to mars but need to refuel the rocket on the moon in between. The main problems in GME at the moment are: the burned ground, insecurities of shareholders and the lost momentum of retail buyers. But what if you target another rocket (AMC) first. To overcome the low momentum in GME you need a new story. Now you tweet some cryptic related shit to draw some attention. The same day you publish your new increased positions in AMC. There is much less attention on AMC in comparison to GME right now, so this would probably be the easier game. If you team up with some of your institutional buddies you are maybe able to trigger a squeeze in AMC. There you go! First part successfully completed. AMC rocket on the moon.

There is your new story! If a lot of retail can participate in the squeeze, YOU are the new story. Now there is a bunch of retards pumped with cash sitting on the moon. They will definitely watch you jumping into the rocket RobinHood parked there for you. Now you have a lot of new cash and a temporary fan base of apes. Next you start buying GME, probably OTC and file it to the SEC. Retail would definitely notice even without any extra tweets and jump in. There you have it. Momentum is back and the starship is ready to go to mars.

This is no financial advice. How could it? It’s a scenario of the conquering of our solar system.  

**TLDR: Use AMC to go to the moon; establish a new base; regain momentum in GME; refuel rocket and go to mars.**_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Robinhood rigs chart peaks to increase upward movements. Robinhood calculates prices - I think we all know this, but they also generate charts after the fact. Today while ETC began to rise it temporarily hit 18.40. A moment later it fell to around 16. Soon after it began to rise again, but while the 18.40 peak has been visible before, the new peak top was 17.89. And sure you can argue it is based on time and the true peak gets rounded off based on intervals between measurements, but this must have a dramatic effect on mindset. Because now, 17.50 appears to be almost equal to the previous peak which was actually a 4.9% higher. Sketchy stuff._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Day 1 of GameStop Hearing - House Committee on Financial Services _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Upcoming Week 2/19 Geee Em Eeee ITM Options Targets: Playing The Market Fuckery... Pt. 2...  Well, as I predicted, they kept the price over $50 so that the stack of 10,000 (yes, ten thousand options) Put contracts didn't get executed. That tells me that they aren't just tanking the price, and that they are playing the options spread at the moment.

It also tells me that they are scared shitless of shares needing to be delivered and taken off of the open market. They'd rather keep the price boosted over $50 to stop delivery than to risk an extra 1,000,000 shares getting into long hands.

But, thankfully, that also let's us know that they're still playing the game. If they were giving up and going into all-or-nothing mode, they wouldn't give a shit about the deliveries. They'd either flood the market with 25,000,000 FTDs while tanking the price to cover at $20 while hoping they have enough left over for the fines... Or they'd cash out what they have left now and file for bankruptcy while leaving the clearing houses to pay the bad debt.

No, they're still planning on finding the cheapest way out of this without any (or minimal) legal trouble. That means we're still getting paid. (Eventually...)

I've been watching this for a while now, and I think I've gotten a hand on what they are doing. This coming week will be the tell-all... And I'm going to explain why I believe the price can only go up...

So. Let's crunch the 2/19 option chain and see where this train is headed... - This Week, oooon Gaaaaaame Theeeeory!... *queue intro music*...

Current price $52:

Put ITM: 59,434

Put OTM: 346,288

Call ITM: 29,930

Call OTM: 87,111

At Current Price, a total of 89,364 option contracts are ITM.

Now, let's look at possible price movement. See, they are keeping Gee em eee at the line of demarcation between the single-dollar price change contracts ($41-$42-$43-et al.)... And the five-dollar price change per contract ($50-$55-$60-et al.)

That means that for every dollar that the stock drops, it executes a new Put option contract... But it would need to climb five dollars to execute a new call option. That's why I told you in the last thread that they are playing between the $50-$54.99 range all week.

See, because of the contract price structuring, it actually costs them MORE to knock the price down any lower. Allow me to explain:

Lets look at both the Call and Put sides of the option chain... And for the nearest $10 swing in prices...

There are 29,337 Put Options for $40-$50 strike.

There are 2,459 Put Options for $51-$59 strike.

There are 13,187 Call Options for $40-$50 strike.

There are 3,066 Call Options for $51-$59 strike.

Now, lemme explain why I believe this matters in predicting where the price is going to drift this week.

If the price were to drop by $10, the net difference would be an ADDITIONAL 16,150 options that would be executed because of the contract price structuring. 10 Put Options would become in the money.

Conversely, if the price went UP by $9, the net difference would be 507 extra contracts that would be able to be executed. Because of the price structuring, only two new Call Option strikes would be able to be executed between $55-$59.

If we were to just look at the next five Put Option contracts below the current strike price, it equals up to 22,175. That means if the price were to DROP $5, they would need to find delivery for an EXTRA 2,217,500 shares.

If the price were to go UP by $5, they would only need to find 85,600 extra shares to cover the extra contracts that would be ITM at $55.

Let me say that again. If the price goes DOWN... It takes MORE shares off the market because of the Put Options going in dollar increments, while the Call Options go up in $5 increments.

It is also interesting to note that ending the week at $59 would cause less deliveries than ending at $55.

My hypothesis: They can't hold the price at $50 this upcoming week simply due to the lack of shares available and the buyer demand staying so consistent. We only had 12mil-13mil volume the last two days. The shares are drying up.

So if they can't hold the price steady, they need to decide which direction to move it. And based on the math, moving the price UP would save the shorts money by causing the lesser of two evils in extra deliveries.

But one thing is for sure. They can't let the price tank any lower this upcoming week. It would trigger too many new deliveries.

(There's actually some serious game theory that says the best move to trigger the squeeze would be for us to ALLOW the price to drop to exactly $39.99 at close of next week... as odd as that seems)

So what's my non-financially-advising-crystal-ball predict that this weeks close will be on 2/19?...

$58.47...

They are going to allow some big single-day swings Tuesday and Wednesday to send the stock price from $52 up to tickle the $60 mark so that they can go balls-deep selling $60C Premium... And then they will hold the price just below the line.

The next target after that would be $69 (giggity), as there is a large off-set of Calls vs Puts at $70 that would cause the delivery equilibrium to start going net positive again. I just don't think they're going to let us get $19 in a single week, as that would cause retail investor interest to start going up again.

Tl;dr: We end next week at $58-$59 and the slow bleeding continues until the week of Feb 26.

I'll be back when I finish another model I'm working on...

 orgininally posted by u / ThatGuyOntheReddits_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Maybe the funniest meme yet, imo. _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Vick and Borty: Triumph of the Boomers _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Akamai Technologies Bullish Thesis Shares of the CDN and cloud security company have dipped about 20% from its January 27th high of $121/share following weaker than expected guidance for 2021 (forecasting 6% growth in revenue).

When I saw that growth estimate I immediately thought they were sand bagging. All of their segments except the web division saw double digit growth in 2020. The first question on the latest analyst call asked why they were forecasting low growth and their CFO said it was due to expectations that their customers in the travel and hospitality division were asking for extended payment terms. I get the concern but that still doesn’t indicate there are any types of default/missed payments looming on the horizon. That sector will make a comeback.

Akamai continues to see a ton of growth in their cybersecurity segment which exceeded $1 billion in revenue for 2020, or 25% YoY growth. Media and carrier division was up 15% YoY. That makes up more than 60% of their revenue. 

I understand Fastly and Cloudfare are taking market share and growing at ridiculous 40-50% comps but to me both are getting a little bit overvalued and that was evident following NET’s drop after earnings. Same will likely happen to Fastly next week when they report.

Overall, this looks like a solid value play with Akamai currently trading at 11x EV/EBITDA for the next 12 months. Historically it trades closer to 15x which would put it around $120/share.

Made a quick analysis between the companies factoring in growth and EV for 2021. The lower EV/Sales to growth, the better.

EV/Sales to Growth
AKAM: 0.76
NET: 1.10
FSLY: 0.95

That being said, there’s a difference between “fuck Melvin” “corrupt citadel” “Steve Cohen is a douche” and the political diatribe.

I don’t see how people urging others to purchase GME in a form of protest (ie not to make money) isn’t a blatant ban of the “no politics” rule?

For some annoying reason very often I would see people talking about GME and how it would go up and making posts betting their son's left nut on the stock and making DD's on the matter but I decided that it was a lost cause, there's no way that outdated company was gonna get out of its grave so I would ignore those posts and laugh at them while sitting on my wife's boyfriend's lap. Time passed by and people would really push the idea that GME was gonna rocket and that's when I started to look at that group of people as part of a cult and all they were missing was the robes and shit.

Some time passed and the stock went up a bit to $20+ and I was like "huh not bad but nothing impressive", weeks passed and it hit $30+ and I still wasn't convinced because again, nothing too crazy. But then shit started to really hit the fan and saw the numbers to go up faster and faster so I decided to buy in the $60 price range and then the GAMESTOPPENING happened. 

I tried recording myself blowing a load all over my TDA homescreen while looking at the numbers but the quality was shit so just imagine it. Even tho the stock fell I'm gonna hold out of respect for all those ignored DD's and those brave retards that gave their lives making posts about it on WSB.

Moral of the story: Don't underestimate people in WSB. Just because a group of people act, sound or talk like a cult, doesn't mean they're in a cult, they might just be WSB retards who happen to be IN a cult. Also separate everything into small paragraphs cause apes don’t read no good.

I'll keep my DD short.

They make:

- Silicon wafers and other materials required to produce microchips and memory
- Equipment for chips manufacturing
- Everything for LCD and OLED displays manufacturing
- Materials for photovoltaic solar panels production

Their biggest customers are:

- TSM (currently building a new factory in the US, and boy it will need a lot of equipment and materials and guess who is gonna supply most of it)
- Samsung (considering building a factory in the US too, if that comes through - massive revenue point for AMAT)
- Intel
- SK Hynix 


**So basically if semiconductor manufacturers are printing money right now (and probably will throughout the whole year) - AMAT supplies them with paper, ink and printers.**

If you're bullish on any of the big semiconductor stocks - you should be bullish on AMAT too, except for it has more reasonable valuation and significantly less exposed to major risks.

I got the stock idea from our man Jewbanks (from Jewbanksjournal) whose known for his killer plays this past year (Nio, Etsy, Snap, Pins among others..) he knows whatsup, he can't post cause of some stupid wsb misunderstanding but he called it 2-3 weeks ago and look what happened since. 

He says its far from over and i believe that too. so its not a meme but its potentially memeable and for the right reasons.

TLDR: stock going to double from here at least within the next weeks/months (or by next friday the way this market is going). get some while its under 5 cause it'll be 10+ soon enough.

"BlackBerry Shares Showing Signs of Irrational Exuberance; Maintain $6.40 FVE; Shares Overvalued"
William Kerwin
Analyst

Analyst Note | by William Kerwin | **Updated Jan 25, 2021**

No-moat BlackBerry’s shares have more than doubled this month, but we have seen no material fundamental changes in the business. While small pieces of news concerning the firm’s licensing business have come out, these have been part of normal business operations, and we don’t expect them to be material to the firm’s cash flows. We think the recent price appreciation has been a result of a change in market sentiment rather than improved firm fundamentals. We maintain our $6.40 fair value estimate for BlackBerry and view shares as significantly overvalued.

BlackBerry’s recent price movements have been concurrent with two pieces of news in January: a sale of 90 patents to Huawei and a patent dispute settlement with Facebook, both of which we think are immaterial to the stock. The patent sale was a small portion of BlackBerry’s 38,000 patents, related to its discontinued legacy handset business. While terms of the Facebook settlement have yet to come out publicly, we estimate it will have a negligible impact on the firm’s financials. BlackBerry earns a robust revenue stream from its patent portfolio—$349 million in revenue in fiscal 2020 (34% of sales)—due in large part to aggressively defending its patents in court.

BlackBerry did report material news in December, when it announced a multiyear partnership with Amazon Web Services to co-develop BlackBerry Ivy, a connected cloud software platform for vehicles. The stock’s rise could also be a delayed reaction to this partnership. However, shares already rose sharply upon the announcement, and there hasn’t been more news since. We didn’t see this news as an immediate game changer (at least not as far as 100%-plus stock price appreciation) and we did not raise our fair value estimate based on this partnership announcement.

Finally, management has said that there are no material, undisclosed developments it can attribute to the recent activity.

Business Strategy and Outlook | by William Kerwin Updated Nov 02, 2020
BlackBerry is a software provider selling primarily into enterprise applications of the Internet of Things. Its flagship product is the Spark suite launched in 2020, which combines unified endpoint management with endpoint protection. The firm is also a leading embedded software provider, focused on the automotive industry. Its QNX software powers infotainment systems, where it leads the market, as well as electronic control units and advanced driver-assistance systems. We think BlackBerry has positioned itself in rapidly growing markets that benefit from secular trends, which should fuel top-line growth.

BlackBerry’s forte is security, with an explicit goal of providing end-to-end secure enterprise communication--just about the only constant between its current business model and the now-retired handset model that made it a household name. The firm performs best in regulated industries such as government, financial services, and healthcare, where security and privacy are more mission-critical. Since John Chen took over as CEO in 2014, he has successfully pivoted BlackBerry to a software model, and the company experienced its first year of revenue growth in nine years in fiscal 2020. The Canadian company’s pivot was fueled by acquisitions, namely the $425 million deal for Good Technology in 2015 that catapulted BlackBerry to the number-two market share in unified endpoint management, and the $1.4 billion Cylance acquisition in 2018 that gave BlackBerry a foothold in the endpoint protection market.

While we don’t think BlackBerry has a moat, as some of its larger competitors in the endpoint management and security spaces do, we think the marriage of endpoint management with Cylance’s proactive threat detection and response will forge a stickier product in Spark. In the short term, we think BlackBerry will focus on its go-to-market strategy as a means to generate organic growth for endpoint software, and seek out further opportunities in autonomous vehicles with its QNX software, as the space presents greater safety/security needs on the part of OEMs, as well as greater content per vehicle for QNX.

Economic Moat | by William Kerwin Updated Nov 02, 2020
We do not believe BlackBerry has an economic moat. Its endpoint management, endpoint security, and embedded systems software solutions compete in highly fragmented markets with relatively low switching costs. While these markets offer moats to larger competitors, we don’t believe BlackBerry’s solutions boast adequately competitive stickiness, and we view its negative historical returns on invested capital as evidence to our opinion. Thus, we do not have confidence it will earn returns in excess of its cost of capital over the next 10 years.

BlackBerry’s software and services segment comprises its flagship Spark suite and its embedded operating system, QNX. Spark combines unified endpoint management, or UEM, software with endpoint protection--what BlackBerry calls unified endpoint security.

UEM provides enterprises with a central interface to monitor and control network access from all endpoints, whether it be employees checking work email on their phones or editing secure documents on a company laptop. BlackBerry’s UEM capabilities originated from the software the company provided enterprises to manage the prevalent BlackBerry handheld devices used by employees, most notably in the mid-2000s. Although BlackBerry devices faded from relevance, the core of the company’s software remained. BlackBerry solidified its presence in the UEM space in 2015 with its $425 million acquisition of Good Technology and held the number-three market share in 2018 with 11.2%, per IDC.

BlackBerry also provides endpoint protection through the Spark suite, gained through its acquisition of Cylance for $1.4 billion in 2018. While UEM provides a firm with the ability to monitor and control access across its network, endpoint protection is about external threat prevention, detection, and response across those endpoints.

While it is our view that switching costs occur frequently in enterprise software, given the time, cost, and effort involved in adopting a new solution and running two concurrent solutions simultaneously during the transition, we don’t think the Spark suite bears moatworthy switching costs. UEM’s selling point of a centralized solution for all devices presents low switching costs relative to other software that have longer implementation times and intertwine with more companywide operating procedures. UEM implementation is restricted primarily to a customer’s IT department, while the greater employee base simply needs to download a new app or become accustomed to two-factor authentication. Several of BlackBerry’s largest competitors in endpoint management have moats, but we think these result from comprehensive portfolios of endpoint solutions and that the fragmented $3 billion UEM market is not enough on its own to bestow a moat on BlackBerry, despite an impressive market share. BlackBerry’s Cylance acquisition gives it more ammo to compete with larger, more comprehensive incumbents, but it will face an uphill battle winning business from the likes of Microsoft or Symantec. We think Spark (with integrated endpoint protection) is a stickier product than BlackBerry’s stand-alone UEM software was, but at every competitor these had already been integrated. Furthermore, the stand-alone endpoint security market is even more fragmented than the endpoint management market, featuring experienced, entrenched giants like Microsoft, Symantec, and CrowdStrike. Competing with unique and best-of-breed services like CrowdStrike and the unmatchable breadth of Microsoft, BlackBerry is likely to struggle to keep old clients and win new ones, even with Cylance’s machine learning and AI detection abilities. Nevertheless, the UEM market is rapidly growing (with estimates ranging from 23% to 36% CAGR through 2024) and BlackBerry remains a leading player. While we anticipate healthy growth from BlackBerry’s enterprise software business, we think a relatively nascent, quickly growing market will attract many new entrants. In a fragmented and rapidly evolving marketplace, we have greater confidence in larger, moat-endowed competitors like Microsoft and VMware to gain an outsize share of new business in the face of new competition, due to their ability to offer established and trusted endpoint protection software alongside endpoint management.

In the same segment, BlackBerry also sells its proprietary embedded software, QNX. Embedded software is the code that allows specific machines to do their jobs, and BlackBerry’s QNX software is sold primarily into the automotive market, as well as medical devices and industrial systems. BlackBerry partners with nearly every major automotive OEM and Tier 1 supplier for instrument clusters, driver-assistance systems, and infotainment, where it boasts market share a hair under 50%.

We see some moatworthy characteristics of the QNX automotive business but don’t think the switching costs are steep enough to award a moat. We liken QNX to moaty auto-parts suppliers in our coverage, with five- to seven-year model lifecycles ensuring a long contractual revenue stream, as BlackBerry incurs about 70% of contract value from car production volume throughout a model’s life. However, compared with the auto suppliers, most of QNX’s functions in the vehicle (primarily infotainment) are not mission-critical, though a proliferation of ADAS and autonomous vehicles may change this. Thus, BlackBerry must compete for every design win, even if it had sold into the prior model version. In infotainment specifically, as Apple CarPlay and Android Auto rise in popularity, automakers may find less reason to pay up for QNX in a new model over a free Linux alternative just to put the Apple or Android interface on top of it.

Finally, BlackBerry has a robust licensing segment where it monetizes its wealth of intellectual property. We think this business has moaty characteristics, given its contractual nature and the long average-weighted life of its patent portfolio. However, we believe the threat of value destruction here is too strong to give this category a narrow moat rating. BlackBerry doesn’t disclose the length or terminal dates of these contracts, and we don’t think the BlackBerry name is strong enough to elicit high retention rates for these licensing agreements. The business can also be mercurial, highlighted by the last BlackBerry-licensed smartphones by TCL ending sales in 2020.

Fair Value and Profit Drivers | by William Kerwin Updated Nov 02, 2020
Our fair value estimate of $6.40 per share implies a 2021 enterprise value/sales ratio of 3 times and a free cash flow yield of 5%.

We forecast compound annual revenue growth of 7% through fiscal 2030. We expect rapid growth for the firm’s Spark solution as it provides a stickier option to customers looking for comprehensive endpoint capabilities. We also expect strong growth for QNX as content gains with AVs of all levels offset market share losses to Android Automotive.

We think as BlackBerry becomes more seasoned as a software company, its gross margins will approach 80%. We expect operating margins to expand significantly over our 10-year explicit forecast, due in part to near-term synergies attained from a positive Cylance integration. Longer term, we expect revenue to rise at a faster pace than marketing spending, but for R&D expenses to stay elevated as the firm continually reinvests in innovation. We anticipate that BlackBerry will reach GAAP profitability by fiscal 2024 and reach operating margins in the 14% range by fiscal 2030.

Risk and Uncertainty | by William Kerwin Updated Nov 02, 2020
Given its tumultuous past and relative lack of operating history as a software company, we assign BlackBerry a very high fair value uncertainty rating. Since 2014, the firm has relied on M&A to pivot its business toward software. It encountered nine straight years of revenue decline, ending in 2020. BlackBerry’s ability to generate meaningful organic growth going forward will be paramount to its success.

BlackBerry’s future will also depend on its ability to integrate and expand upon prior acquisitions, specifically Cylance. As an endpoint protection platform, Cylance could bolster every other BlackBerry product by layering on advanced machine learning and artificial intelligence capabilities. However, we have yet to see management drive organic growth out of this addition in its early days.

BlackBerry competes in highly fragmented and competitive markets, against some of the largest companies out there. It may be difficult for BlackBerry to maintain or steal market share from companies such as Microsoft, IBM, and VMware with 10 or more times the revenue and R&D budget that it has. BlackBerry encounters the opposite problem with its QNX software, where it must compete with freely available Android and Linux operating systems. In these markets, it will need to continually innovate ahead of the competition to maintain pricing power, and thus market share, over these alternatives.

BlackBerry faces risk from being a relatively small and unproven new entrant into its key markets. Customers that are highly risk averse might opt to go with a more established competitor for an end-to-end solution, especially when money is tight. While in periods of economic growth, its name recognition might help to attract customers, in downturns, customers might steer clear of a name they associate with a sharp drop-off from a leadership position in the smartphone market in the early 2010s.

Capital Allocation | by William Kerwin Updated Nov 02, 2020
We assign BlackBerry a Standard stewardship rating. BlackBerry doesn’t pay a dividend or conduct share repurchases, choosing instead to allocate any excess capital to further inorganic growth.

CEO John Chen came into his role in 2014 in the middle of the company’s fall from the top of the smartphone world and led the firm’s pivot into software. As the firm’s handset sales experienced steep declines, he executed key acquisitions to help gain footholds in what are now BlackBerry’s primary markets. The $425 million acquisition of Good Technology in 2015 helped make BlackBerry’s existing mobile device management software platform-agnostic and catapulted the firm to a top-three share in the unified endpoint management market. In the years following, Chen tacked on a secure communication platform, Secusmart, and a secure crisis notification service, AtHoc. Most recently and significantly, BlackBerry acquired Cylance, planting one foot squarely into the endpoint protection market. We think the acquisitions under Chen’s tenure have expanded the firm’s product portfolio into high-growth markets and bode well for the future. While the firm’s revenue has been declining since 2011, its software and services revenue has been growing nicely, due primarily to the aforementioned acquisitions.

We think Chen identified good M&A targets, but it is now time for him to prove he can generate organic growth out of them under the BlackBerry umbrella. Being known as a bit of a turnaround aficionado, Chen’s last charge was as chief executive of Sybase, a software and database company that he brought back into the black and sold at a 50% premium to SAP for $5.8 billion in 2010. We remain skeptical of BlackBerry’s luster as an M&A target, but at the very least the return to profitability appears to be underway.

Long 1,000 Shares_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Intel's hidden gem, Mobileye Yesterday I put out my first DD piece on Intel, the most undervalued high cap company in the US stock market. Of course it left a sour but familiar taste in the mouths of Lisa Su's cuck army and AMD fanboys. Today I'm here with another treat for you, don't be shy I know deep down you like it. 

Honestly Intel has so many juicy bits of DD to squeeze out its hard to pick where to start. 

[from Intel's 10K pg17](https://preview.redd.it/oxulb5pl7ah61.png?width=733&format=png&auto=webp&s=ed1d4f2b7e110578ceafa5d0cb790a7fb85d476d)

Nevertheless I know you are hungry so Ill start with an appetizer. 

Mobileye

Don't be fooled, If Mobileye was an independent company it would probably be you guys' main dish and desert after it had been pumped to a 100B market cap like many of the "tech of the future" sector stocks. The reality is, Mobileye is the future and the 100B market cap would probably not be that outlandish in this market. One word:

Autonomous vehicles.

That's right, a market that is in its most infant state but that has the potential to be bigger than the United Kingdoms economy by 2030. 

Don't take it from me "The market is then expected to recover and grow at a CAGR of 12.7% from 2021 ad reach $1,191.8 billion in 2023. The market is expected to reach $1,642.9 billion in 2025 growing at a CAGR of 17.4%, and $3,195.0 billion in 2030 growing at a CAGR of 14.2%. "1\*

Mobileye is one of the leaders in the autonomous vehicle industry and is poised not just to grow in market share but to take over. Last year they brought in for Intel a cool Billion, yeah I know its nothing much, its just double AMDs net earnings last quarter and about 1 and a bit% of Intel's annual revenues. Oh yeah I know you must be seething at the way I am phrasing this. 

Professor Amnon Shashua (CEO of Mobileye) who you will be calling Daddy very soon when your asymmetric relationship with Su Bae doesn't work out had some interesting things to say this year, " Despite unprecedented challenges to the auto industry amid the COVID-19 pandemic, we secured more than 37 new design wins, including deals with major OEMs such as Geely and Ford. We are currently active in 49 production programs1  across over 25 OEMs." 

Intel also acquired Moovit to facilitate Mobileyes dominance, "We acquired Moovit to accelerate Mobileye's MaaS offering. Moovit is known for its urban mobility application and brings Mobileye closer to achieving our plan to become a complete mobility provider, including robotaxi services."

Fuck Tesla fake autonomous driving program, when the robo taxis do come they will have mobileye in them. 

Intel bought Mobileye for 15.3 Billion $ in March 2017 when they were at the start of a year that brought them 200 million $ in revenue. You see what I mean when I say this could be valued at 100B in market cap given the current market (Its a type of bubble(might not pop but its still a bubble), IDGAF what you say). 

But Intel's market cap is only 250B? What's going on here Mr Market? Have you been eating crayons? Its alright, a little nudge and you will wake up. 

By buying Intel you are in effect able to buy a stake in the future of autonomous vehicles at tremendous discount. 

Like I said, this is just a little treat. Intel is a full meal and it has a lot to give.

1700 INTC shares, 500 April 16th 80$ strike calls and yesterday before close I added a little 50 Feb 26th 65$ strikes for good measure. Your wife's boyfriend is counting on you to be smart and by Intel calls or you wont be able to subsidize their trip to the Maldives.

enjoy,_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Why GameStop and Ryan Cohen will win. [DD] No Diamond Hands Required. Alright apes and autists, let me explain why I believe GameStop has a strong fundamental case without mentioning diamond hands and short squeeze. If Ryan Cohen can successfully execute his vision, this leaky vessel will turn into a rocket ship blasting past the moon to the edge of the observable universe.

On November 16, 2020, Ryan Cohen sent a letter to the GameStop's Board of Directors titled "Maximizing Stockholder Value by Becoming the Ultimate Destination for Gamers". In it, Ryan Cohen outlined the roadmap for GameStop to pivot and become a technology first company. Let me boil this down for you in simple language for you smooth brain apes.

**The Mission Statement**

"GameStop needs to evolve into a technology company that delights gamers and delivers exceptional digital experiences \[...\] the successful and durable players of tomorrow will be technology-first companies that specialize in gaming products, experiences and services."

**The Landscape**

* Explosive Growth in the Gaming Industry
   * "The size of the global gaming market has grown by more than 2.5x since the last console cycle."
   * "The global gaming market expected to be $174.9 billion this year and reach $217.9 billion by 2023."
* Valuable Assets
   * Existing "strong brand" and recent Reddit frenzy is net positive to the brand, increases awareness, and strengthens its base.
   * "Large customer base and 55 million PowerUp members."
   * Large retail and physical footprint.

**The Roadmap**

* Evolve into a Technology-first company
   * "Technology is changing nearly every aspect of the gaming world, ranging from the way gamers shop to how they interact and compete with one another."
   * GameStop will have to "begin building a powerful e-commerce platform that provides competitive pricing, broad gaming selection, fast shipping and a truly high-touch experience that excites and delights customers." (Ryan successfully executed this vision with Chewy and he can do it again in gaming)
   * GameStop will have to "hire the right talent." (So far, Ryan has recruited 5 rock stars from Chewy and Amazon to join the team, more on that later).
* Create the Ultimate Gaming Platform
   * "Shift to purchasing from mass retailers and other online competitors." (Create a marketplace of wanted products and services, i.e. Amazon, Target, App Store)
   * Provide and expand "larger gaming catalogs" (Capture all games)
   * Create "community experiences" (This could be both physical and digital experiences)
   * Provide "streaming services" (New vertical opportunity for content creation, tournaments, and others)
   * Support "Esports" (Expanding scene that is not going away)
* Transition to Digital
   * "Industry developments in recent years" include "transition from physical hardware to digital streaming" and the "explosion of mobile."
   * Expand "digital content." (This needs to be a focus as it's competing against Steam, Blizzard, App Store, etc)
   * Allow "online trade-ins." (This would be a game changer)
* Cut Excessive costs
   * "Cut its excessive real estate costs" and "identify duplicative, under performing stores and plan to forgo lease renewals."
   * Streamline "Non-core operations in Europe and Australia \[...\] in order to reduce losses and potentially generate cash."
   * "Near-term increases in cash flow stemming from the console cycle can also help finance the future."

**The Financials**

Analysts are valuing GameStop as a traditional brick-and-mortar business. If Ryan can properly execute and transform the company, I believe they can become the Target and Chewy of Gaming with potential verticals of streaming and Esports (not factored into this calculation for now). GameStop makes roughly $8 Billion in Revenue, however it is currently valued at a $3.5B Market Cap as it bleeds cash. Target makes roughly $78B in Revenue with $3.3B in Net Income and a Market Cap of $96 Billion. Chewy makes roughly $4.8B in Revenue, losing money but growing quickly, and is valued at $44B in Market Cap. Target and Chewy are valued at 1.25x to 9x Price to Sales respectively. This equates to $10B to $72B Market Cap transposed to GameStop. Obviously, this is very simplistic and does not consider their balance sheet and other factors, but given these metrics:

* GameStop stock price potential is between $143 to $1,032 a share based on a current revenues.

Note this is assuming $8B in Revenue. If GameStop can grow revenues, focus on digital to improve margins, and expand within the growing total addressable market, I see potential for higher prices and achieving Target to Chewy-like multiples.

**The X Factor**

I believe Ryan Cohen was offered to lead GameStop's transition with significant control and autonomy. Otherwise, I do not believe he would have joined the Board. In his letter, Ryan simply stated that "RC Ventures is not interested in receiving a lone seat on GameStop's ten-member Board. It is not enticing to become an isolated stockholder advocate on a Board that has overlooked years of digital revenue opportunities and presided over massive value destruction without assuming full accountability." With the recent additions of two Chewy Executives to the Board of Directors, a new Chief Technology Officer who was the Engineering Lead in Amazon Web Services, a new Customer Care Executive from Chewy, and a new Fulfillment Executive from Amazon, I believe Ryan is executing his vision and revamping the GameStop team.

Notice his hires are from Chewy and Amazon? Ryan Cohen was obsessed with Amazon’s customer centric philosophy and built Chewy to follow that same model. He is hiring digital and e-commerce focused leaders to manage this transformation. Ryan's customer centric obsession is what allowed Chewy to beat Amazon. If GameStop pivots to digital and follows that same obsession, this will be a great opportunity to win.

Furthermore, I believe Ryan's vision is the right roadmap for GameStop. Digital e-commerce, streaming, and mobile is the future and Ryan fully acknowledges and embraces that future. GameStop will need to revamp and modernize their website and phone app, but I am sure that will follow in the months ahead. GameStop has the financial and brand assets that should weather this storm, but execution will be key. Ryan owns nearly 10% of GameStop, so he has a vested interest in its success and has much more to lose than my stake.

So degens, I say think with your heart and not with your smooth brain. Strap in and sit tight, this rocket ship may turn into a long journey to Mars. Maybe Papa Elon will be our catalyst.

P.S. If we all buy something from GameStop this quarter we can load this rocket ship ourselves.

**I) The Short Interest Numbers**

Short interest ("SI") is calculated by shares shorted over total outstanding shares. *See* [*https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortinterest.asp*](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortinterest.asp). Apparently other firms have used different versions of float. All other forms of float are likely incorrect, and not likely used by Finra. **This is an important assumption** \- if I am wrong here, then fuck.

**Edit** (to above): People are suggesting my float is wrong. That is exactly my point. I am using float as outstanding shares b/c we don't know what it is. If someone actually knows the float used by FINRA, post it; this post is then useless. The math working backwards from 226% is fair game, however. That's why it's possible I'm wrong (*see* [*https://www.highshortinterest.com/*](https://www.highshortinterest.com/)*)*. *See also* comment by [JeanGuyRubberboots](https://www.reddit.com/user/JeanGuyRubberboots/) below (ctrl+f). *Either way, it's remarkable that $GME on some sources is still the most shorted stock.* I want to see the actual float used by FINRA. Until then, here's the math based on the SI equation.

Total outstanding shares of GME is 69.75 million. *See* [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics/](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics/).

Finra SI of GME is .78 as of January 27th. *See* [*http://finra-markets.morningstar.com/MarketData/EquityOptions/detail.jsp?query=126%3A0P000002CH&sdkVersion=2.58.0*](http://finra-markets.morningstar.com/MarketData/EquityOptions/detail.jsp?query=126%3A0P000002CH&sdkVersion=2.58.0).

.78\*69.75 million = 54.405m. Thus, 54.045m million shares are short GME of January 27th.

To calculate real SI, we remove insider ownership. **Another big assumption**. Insider ownership stands at 19.06m. *See* [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/insider-transactions/](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/insider-transactions/).

Thus, free float is outstanding shares *less* insider ownership shares. 50,750,000 shares.

**Real SI appears, at minimum, 1.07 (54.405m/50.750m).**

\----

**II) The Shorts Remaining and Covered**

On January 15th, GME SI stood at 121%. *See* [https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/are-these-the-best-heavily-shorted-stocks-to-buy-right-now-5-names-to-watch-2021-01-31](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/are-these-the-best-heavily-shorted-stocks-to-buy-right-now-5-names-to-watch-2021-01-31).

Thus, from January 15th to the 27th, we know at least 84.397m shares were shorted. (1.21\*outstanding shares).

By January 27th, 54.405m shorts remained (previous short amounts minus current shorts remaining as of 1.27). The number of shorts that covered from Jan. 15th to the 27th was was 29.992m. 29.992m/84.397m shares = \~35%. Thus, 65% of shorts pre-squeeze remain, owing APR.

Around \~35% of covering resulted in a 1,600% rise. Thus, a 65% cover rate (conservative) can yield a 2,971% rise. Let’s apply this math to now. From $50, this is a $1,485.50 GME price result. Could this happen? No idea. Notice the problem with this: I'm assuming *only* covering led to this rise. So this is simply a demonstrative point.

**New shorts from Jan. 27th to present likely opened at higher prices. 65% of those from $5, $10, $20, etc., probably remain. This is bad news for HF's.**

**III) The Effect**

Based on estimated remaining covers, price stagnation at $50 could result in further covering and collateral calls. This burden is reduced if HF's opened new shorts at the peak and they are substantially ITM. This part is unclear. We know it's very likely that HF's opened new shorts at the peak--- what isn't clear is that it was within their risk department's policy to open new shorts during a fucking squeeze. In my opinion, it wasn't until drops below <$200 the HF's felt safe opening up new shorts. This is a substantial point: if the new shorts are at much lower price points than thought, then the pain points for HF's are far lower. It's just unclear. Nonetheless, HF's may be bleeding substantially every week because of those remaining shorts.

A good counter is that borrow rates currently seem low for new positions. *See* [https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME). You'd think these are correlated markets, so the most shorted stock on the market would have higher borrow rates. Borrow rates could be low because it's no longer shorted. Or because there is no volume on the stock. I'm not sure what borrow rates are for open short positions, but I imagine they're higher. I don't know more beyond this. Feel free to debate.

Moreover, consider the current liquidity and volume of $GME. It appears that retail buying power is spent. People either cashed out or are holding. So, they are unlikely to trigger the next squeeze - or a gamma one for that matter. Thus, the fighting grounds has likely gone institutional. Not all hedge funds are short $GME - nor are all financial whales. In my view, this has become an institutional fight, with both sides pointing the gun at each other, waiting who's going to pull the trigger first. Retail is simply on the sidelines, holding the clips in for both their guns (smirking, of course). How long until every chump with a few million bucks laying around realizes this is still the most shorted stock on the market before they infuse substantial buying pressure? Or I guess one Moby Dick will do it. My reservations in these predictions is that HF's are smart, they can't be fooled twice, etc., and all of that non-sense. But before intelligence comes greed. And I know greed and desperation has always governed the financial system.

**IV) Parting Thoughts**

It would take a half-brained monkey 45 seconds to crunch the short interest numbers. Yet Finra was late (posted after hours I think). This is the most shorted stock on the market according to my numbers - yet, again, **dead silence** from the mainstream media. Sources are using various versions of float to calculate SI, as if suddenly short interest is something that be manipulated based on our interests. Americans with $2,000 in their checkings account are being investigated for stock fraud.

The Big Short is illustrative. It depicts how corruption and fraud has always been the building blocks of our financial institutions. Put differently, fraud doesn't just pervade the system - nay, it ***is*** the system. Everything I've seen *just doesn't feel right*. Understand at this point I'm speculating. But I trust my gut.

There are also posts suggesting OTM/ITM options are encouraging institutional price manipulations of $GME. This is beyond my knowledge span. However, if you looked at the bid-ask spreads this week of $GME, they were at times pennies apart for days. I've never seen that before. Seriously, **what the fuck.**

DFV is testifying alongside the CEO's of Robinhood, Citadel, and Melvin Capital. Next Thursday is a day to watch for me. Again $GME will be the most discussed and watched stock in America - and, arguably, the globe. Americans *and the world* will be reminded why their holdings in $GME tanked 50-90%. For many, their life savings. No, it wasn't a result of imprudent investments -- to invest money into a squeezing stock is a *good* idea short-term. It was the clearing houses pulling the plugs because *the financial system was never designed for working people to make that much money. So when the risk of you getting that rich increased, they stopped the game (pun intended)*. We don't even need to get into whether there was intentional collusion - that's just speculation, and it doesn't even matter to establish how messed up this is. But think of how this plays out: these institutions either bullshit their way through the hearing and everyone and their moms sees past it. Or they tell you the truth that, based on risk management and capital models, they never thought retail would get that rich that fast. Either way, I don't think it'll play out well for them other than DFV on national television. A key element to the public's reaction: AOC grilling the hell out of these folks. That will likely infuriate a lot of Americans watching.

And to set the record straight, I don't think retail is propping $GME at $50 because they have diamond hands -- middle America is holding because *they have nothing to lose* after the clearing houses and Robinhood tanked their portfolios by over half. **So their plan to kill off retail interest backfired.** In the process of stunting buying pressure, they inadvertently made chunks of working America diamond holders. Poetic justice - and fucking hilarious.

I'm not demonizing rich people. We all want financial freedom. I'm demonizing cheating the game. However this ends one thing is clear: The Big Squeeze is going to be an epic movie.

**TLDR: it's in the damn title.**

Short term Tendies are possible # Let's get some facts down

Intel recently replaced its CEO with [Pat Gelsinger](https://newsroom.intel.com/news-releases/intel-appoints-tech-industry-leader-pat-gelsinger-as-new-ceo/). He worked at VMWare as their CEO and has worked at Intel when he was 18. Right now [Rocket lake](https://www.pcgamer.com/new-benchmarks-show-intel-rocket-lake-chips-leading-comet-lake-and-amd-zen-3-in-single-core/) is set to release soon. Based on the success of [Tiger lake](https://www.theverge.com/21440302/intel-tiger-lake-hands-on-tests-core-i7-1185g7-processor-release) this might put intel back into the game. They are also releasing [a GPU](https://www.pcgamer.com/intel-xe-hpg-tease-3dmark-mesh-shader/) soon. For more news like this, I would watch GamerNexus( Bot won't let me link it) who does really great reviews from the technical standpoint. They are planned to release 3nm and 5nm chips later this year or in 2022( They are just getting the contracts right now. No date yet). Also, they had an outstanding year despite losing their crown to $AMD back in Q4.

Just on their own their looking to bounce right back up from the pandemic. They still have some grow room from a lower revenue year. I bet this stock could go to $90 or even to $100 with rocket lake, and that's a short term gain meaning tendies in time for summer. But what about the long term or market correction.

# Data Analysis

|CompanyMarket|Market cap|Dividends /share price|Q4 '20 revenue|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|$INTC|250.07 billion|0.0213557676751335|20 billion|
|$AMD|113.58 Billion|0.0154633678148662|3.24 billion|
|$NVDA|370.44 Billion|0.0010694293591779|3.11 billion|

As someone who has been in the hardware space and is up to date on info Intel is underpriced compared to $AMD and $NVDA. What was holding intel back was the management and it changed. Intel is about to beat AMD and I would hop on the spaceship before it goes to the moon. so what is a reasonable price?

if intel sock matches $AMD's Market Cap to revenue then its market cap would go to 700 billion. The positive press of the stock could bring it to 750 billion. But Intel's revenue is about to spike. President Joe Biden is planning to increase supply and if Intel can take advantage of that they can produce more chips where chips are out of stock. In 2020 GPU's sold out in a second leaving gamers without new gear. The 1050 ti, a failure when it came out, got rereleased and became one of the biggest successes this year. that's how desperate people are. [r/pcmasterrace](https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/) was hit the hardest and many of them want the fastest gear. Intel could fill this void left by AMD and NVDA. if Intel can get enough stuff out then I could see a 500 billion market cap( with market correction, meaning that intel gets a fair price).

I currently do not have a position in INTC right now, but I plan to do so as soon as my wife's boyfriend will let me.

Comment section is pretty crazy over there, checked their stock and it’s been a downhill since yesterday, not sure if there’s any correlation. Also saw recent post on here talking about why the op thinks DD will come crashing down. Time to short or buy the dip???_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Notes about BB, Cylance, Amazon, Kuiper, antennas, and why I'm 1000% okay with buying BB at $20. A note about Cylance before I jump into the rest.

The concept of the original Cylance product is absolutely excellent...behavioral (not AV definition) protection against viruses. Frankly, it's the way it should have always been done. You don't need to know the name of the guy punching you in the face, you just need to prevent getting punched. However, their implementation and service was garbage. I'm saying this as someone who implemented it extensively in a large enterprise environment. BB buying Cylance was a good move, IF they can build it and support it better. However, as potentially disruptive as it could be, a rebuild has to happen fast or there will be better competition with the same philosophy very soon and that opportunity will be lost.

Unless...it's not a play for the PC and server protection market at all. If you think about it in terms of their other product offerings, it makes sense. Automotive operating systems are a massive and incredibly dangerous target, both in the frame of making sure a terrorist doesn't use your vehicle to kill you or others, and in the protection of mobile retail for the people sitting in their self-driving cars and shopping on the way to work.

Behavioral protection makes absolute sense there, as there will definitely be ties between the car itself and what you do in it. The car's sanctity must be protected at all costs. So, look to BB be integrating this protection philosophy into it's automotive efforts.

...

Now, on a very related topic.  

https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/12/07/investors-overreacting-blackberry-deal-with-amazon/

BB has teamed up with Amazon...

> The two tech companies will co-develop and market BlackBerry IVY, a new "cloud-connected intelligent vehicle data platform" that offers automakers a "standardized secure way to read and analyze vehicle sensor data." IVY will merge BlackBerry's QNX embedded OS for vehicles with AWS' IoT (Internet of Things) and machine learning services.

And Amazon is getting into the satellite-mesh internet business as a competitor to Musk's SpaceX Starlink.

https://www.pcmag.com/news/amazons-satellite-internet-service-starts-to-take-shape-with-antenna-prototype

And Amazon has bought Zoox to get into self-driving cars: https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/26/amazon-buys-self-driving-technology-company-zoox.html

Amazon is big into antenna development: https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/innovation-at-amazon/amazon-marks-breakthrough-in-project-kuiper-development

> Rajeev Badyal, VP of Technology for Project Kuiper at Amazon. “This simple fact inspired one of our key tenets for Kuiper: to invent a light, compact phased array antenna that would allow us to produce an affordable customer terminal. It’s incredible to see such a small form factor delivering this type of speed and performance.”

Let's think about we've got existing or in development...

* A secure operating system (QNX)
* A system of sensors to read it (IVY)
* Cars that use the OS and provide the sensors (175 million using QNX now, will only grow)
* A system to protect the cars (Cylance or whatever is built from it)
* A massive retail company (Amazon)
* Mobile internet worldwide (Amazon's Project Kuiper)
* Cars that will use that mobile internet (phased array antenna)
* Self-driving cars (Zoox purchase)

Resulting in: A bored and captive audience of consumers, sitting in their self-driving cars, insulated from the world, protected from the bad folks, spending their cash and surfing behind tinted windows. Amazon making a ton of cash. Blackberry receiving some of that on multiple fronts.

I'm not telling you what to do. I'm just satisfied that I bought BB at $20, and will be buying more over time, maybe at a lower price but definitely at a higher one.

greetings from GMT +1, stay hydrated_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Visualization of crossover in meme stock discussion. Analysis in comments. _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ An Australian stem cell biotech about to moon $MESO I know there is a lot of shit stock going around here, and that biotechs are risky, but I've done my DD. This is no shit post, but I think we have a small Australian biotech about to go around the twist.

$MESO trades on the NASDAQ and ASX. It's a Melbourne biotech that has had a whole bunch of recent catalysts. They specifically focus on stem cell therapies to treat a range of diseases. Now if you believe in stem cell therapies long term, I think $MESO could be a good buy;  


* aGVHD: Mesoblast's Remstemcel to treat this horrible disease received a 9-1 ODAC vote but the FDA still gave Mesoblast a CRL meaning the drug wouldn't receive a BLA. They are in ongoing discussions with the FDA as this is an unmet need where no other treatment options exist with high mortality. I think this will eventually get conditional approval.
* CHF: Chronic heart failure is one of the biggest killers in the world. Their recent phase 3 trial here reduced MACE events by 60% in a statistically significant random controlled experiment. Many physicians have said this will change the paradigm of how we treat heart failure. Expect $MESO to partner with big pharma on this one. It's worth lots of tendies. It didn't meet the primary endpoint which was reduction in hospitalisations, but absolutely crushed the secondary endpoints which are more meaningful anyway.
* COVID19 ARDS: This was using remestemcel to reduce inflammation for COVID patients. Eventually they stopped enrolling as they didn't think it would reach statistical significance, mostly because the course and treatment paradigm throughout the pandemic has changed. ie, ventilator is now a last resort etc... However, these results are being unblinded and they've done a major partnership with Novartis on this one for all cause ARDS.

If you think stem cell therapies have a place as standard of care in the future then I think $MESO is a good one to throw some dumb money at considering they've completed quite a few P3 trials and it shows their product clearly works. They just need partners, getting their trials designed a bit better now that they understand more about mechanisms of action, subsets of patients and when to target them with treatment. It's only a matter of time before the first stem cell therapy is approved in the US and I think it's this lil down under biotech $MESO to get the job done.

This is not financial advice and I have my entire life savings in $MESO._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ 🐳 🪓 Whales to Watch: Week of 2/16 Hi.  Here's what I'm looking at headed into next week. **Shoutout to Unusual Whales who I’ve spoken with and has given their blessing for me to provide these plays and screenshots. I recommend them bigly**

I monitor flow on Barchart and Think or Swim

I’ve typically written about choosing close-dated plays, but I’m giving a little expiration room on these as I sense some sector rotation I want to feel out. 

Been on a nice little streak with these of late, so I am overdue for an account correction lol.  This is not investment advice.

*The whale plays I am interested in:*

[FSLY 2/26 110c](https://i.imgur.com/U00vNOa.jpg)🚀 🚀 🚀 

I like this for two reasons.  **The first is simple**: I've seen repeat call flow into FSLY building up over the past two weeks, and it just can't sustain the pops yet.  It's a similar pattern I saw to the DKNG and NIO calls before their pops.  *Continued betting OTM by whales gives me more confidence with each slip, and pressure for an upward pop is building.*. **The second reason** is the dump after the NET ER.  I love when sympathy plays get oversold, because it's easy entry into their earnings run.  

**How I’m going to play it**: I'll follow the whale on a call spread up to 110 for 2/19, and ride it up until just before earnings Wednesday, then cut it.  Successful strategy I've been employing with tech earnings runs lately; last week I just closed my eyes and threw a dart at TWTR OTM calls and rode it up for about 100% the day of.  Sure, you miss out if earnings are a banger, but I have an increasingly strict no earnings rule.

**Earnins run= yes.  Holding through earnings= no**

[M 3/26 20c](https://i.imgur.com/ybj1GMB.jpg)🚀 🚀 🚀 

Everyone always brushes aside my precious M plays but they are a quiet money-maker.  Once the dust has settled from the Great Memeing, M is back on watch again as a quiet beast finally waking up.  ER is on 2/23, and they have a couple things going for them, including:

**1) The B of A BBBY upgrade**: [bulls are returning on BBBY now that the squeeze is over and their reasoning is strikingly similar to the M story](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/bed-bath-beyond-becomes-more-attractive-with-short-squeeze-over-b-of-a-says-11613076266).  Store closures?  Bullish.  Narrowly avoiding bankruptcy? Mega boolish.  But more importantly...
**2) Digital integration**: the CEO of M is actually a solid leader, and has really pushed the transition to digital and online merchandising.  I think this pivot will gain more spotlight headed into ER.

**How I’ll play it**: M is a super streaky stock that can give you 8% return multiple days in a row, but can also frustratingly do the opposite.  It also tends to really crater in the mornings before stabilization and rising late in the day.  I will give this manic whale a chance on the 3/26c, while also clutching a more reasonable 16c 2/26 into the ER.  I will cut the 3/26 20c at the first sign of multi-day trouble

[VXX 4/1 20c ](https://i.imgur.com/kmKd8NC.jpg) 🚀 😭 

I have long been a consort of the mystical VXX, and [here is a previous DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jfhdta/volatility_for_dummies_vxx_uvxy_vxx_and_spy/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) I did on how it works.  It is approaching absurd lows, fear and greed is rising, and all that other doomed shit you hear.  What really signals to me this is the time to expand this hedge is the potential for sector rotation (and the currently happening rotation).  **As money outflows from big tech this past week post-earnings, we are seeing an expansion of call flow into more speculative industries like again like weed, EV, and forgotten titans like industrials/cyclicals, so forth.**  AnAlYsTS will try to scare you in the coming weeks and say tech is overvalued and done--this is untrue, but the outflow/inflow tides of the market will present plenty of transition pain dips that feel like corrections.

**How I’ll play it:** a VXX 16c 2/26 feels right to purchase on a Tuesday dip meant)

Another one that has seen a lot of call pressure building up.  This cruise line seems like it's just waiting for more favorable news to give it a huge push.  *I understand and agree with the problems with travel right now: this is not an endorsement of the end of COVID, but I like the stock*, and I like the potential for upward movement.  I'll likely play this one as the whale has and exercise patience.  Has potential for wild swings, though, so keeping a close eye on this one.

**EV grab bag: TSLA 3/19 970c NIO 3/5 67.5c WKHS 2/19 46c (QS assorted strikes for ER run &?upgrades, and FSR off upgrades)**🚗 🚀 

Major call flow into both NIO and TSLA all week; my last DD I was able to successfully pinpoint this movement into NIO, and it feels similar.  **QS and FSR got lots of attention after upgrades and into QS earnings, but the titans are positioned to explode after some from frustrating coiling**. NIO in particular lately has been moving slower than a white man in slippers.  TSLA is a pricey ass premium, so maybe consider focusing on NIO or call spreads.

**BONUS**: QS earnings could be when they finally reveal their revolutionary technology which prevents dendrites. This is the holy grail of EV battery production, and they boldly claim they have figured it out. The lawsuit is standard hot air from people upset their stock tanked in this weird ass meme of a market and I am unbothered. 

**WKHS dip feels like it was a blessing,** but I may wait for a little more dip on Tuesday because this thing is streaky as fuck.  People could be positioning into the Q2 (hopeful) EV deal announcement with the USPS.

As I was on my ROKU with the gf looking for the latest episode of "My 600 LB Life", got confirmation bias through an ad for FUBO lol.  More importantly, Benzinga picked up that dude from Twitter Mr. Zack Morris as an excuse to put it on their watchlist.  We all know how pumps go at this point: 
Random twitter ---> Benzinga (or other random watchlist) pickup ----> random analyst upgrades ---> CNBC pump ----> several crisis segments dedicated to WSB for MaNiPuLaTiOn

**General theme I am seeing:**

*Call flow into into big tech has really, really dried up*.  I'm hoping this continues into next week, because then we could be in a really nice position to pick up some March and April monthlies in struggling behemoths like FB.  TWTR is doing it's thing, but it seems like the looming AAPL privacy concerns have put a stranglehold on other big tech companies relying on advertising data.

**Play I just like this week:**

[PLTR reports Tuesday Premarket](https://i.imgur.com/MkoiiWz.jpg) and I think there is a chance to hop on no matter the outcome.  Sells off because earnings these days are stupid?  Buy the dip.  Starts to rocket off some news or a beat?  Hop on.  PLTR feels like a win-win rn at this price point no matter the earnings report brings.

**Fellow Bulls beware:** 🐻 

Quantitave Easing is taking a hit.  [Quietly last month, the FED announced they were discontinuing the repo program; nobody noticed this but we had a huge dip that day](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-27/fed-ending-term-repos-reflects-liquidity-feast-for-dealers#:~:text=The%20Federal%20Reserve’s%20decision%20to,term%20repos%20set%20for%20Feb.&text=Overnight%20repo%20operations%20will%20continue). Treasury yield also has been stubbornly climbing.  Long story short, these are caution flags for an outflow from stonks into stable long-term securities.  Not ringing the bear alarm, but just shit you should know.

I change this a bit on Mondays based on what I'm seeing, as they re the most accurate days according to statistics. (Tuesday this time)

**TLDR**: 

Tech calls drying up for the meantime, looks like the outflow could be headed to speculative sectors, particularly EV.  Potential DOW flight coming.  Hedge with VXX pretty heavily, and retail that is doing digital integration may get the proper spotlight now post-meme.

You can do your own DD, but there are 3 companies left in the running for the new contract with USPS for new mail trucks. The other 2 companies have electric trucks in the running but Oshkosh has one with a diesel motor in it.  From what I’ve read more than one company may be chosen so I’m banking that they will go with an electric and gas option, which means Oshkosh would be chosen having the only combustion engine offered. There are lots of rural areas across the country where electric wouldn’t be the best option. Also, the fact that Oshkosh already has contracts with the US Government making specialty trucks and military vehicles, seems to be an added benefit. 

USPS is scheduled to make an announcement in the first quarter of this year and long calls on $OSK are still fairly cheap. Just wondering what others think about what appears to be a golden opportunity?

I’m no expert on the stock market and this is my first post here as I’m new to trading.  I don’t think I can really go wrong with this company given their diversity of products and long stable history. Also, the fact that I lost so much money to GME, I feel like I have gotten my big burn out of the way! Let me know what you think!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Long ass DD on why being long on Macerich will make you rich ## Introduction

Macerich is a REIT that specialize in shopping centers (you know, that thing that you don't go to anymore because of Amazon and the pandemic).

The company has performed very poorly company wise (occupancy dropped to 89.8% in 2020 from 95.4% in 2018) and in stock price (it dropped from $90 in July 2016 to $6 in April 2020 and is now at $12.90).

There are a few worrying things about this company. So let's go through them one by one and see how bad they are.

## Their debt

They've increased their debt (from 54.5% in 2018 to 66.4% in 2019 to a whopping 83.5% of their market cap in end 2020). Leverage like that on shopping centers (you know that thing you don't go to anymore because of amazon and the pandemic) could be ok : they don't really care about the declining revenue of those shopping centers, they just need them to pay their leases. But 2 things are pretty worrisome : i) some retail stores might go bankrupt and ii) Macerich is using $1.5bn of their line of credit.

To counteract that : The bankruptcy issue for retail stores is not that big of a deal for Macerich  and they have a (good) plan if they have to repurpose a shopping mall (both explained below). And for the line of credit thingy, their unencumbered assets (an asset or property that is free and clear of any encumbrances, such as creditor claims or liens) are sufficient enough to cover their $1.5bn in line of credit if it's needed. They can also dilute the shares to raise more capital. They've also filed for an ATM offering for up to $500 million.

## Occupancy / Rent collection 

Their occupancy is at 89.7	% (for the shopping centers that are not under development nor redevelopment). This is down from the 95.4% it was at in 2018 or the 94% in 2019.

The good news however is that "*rent collections, for example, during April and May were 35%, that grew to 80% in the third quarter. And as of today, the fourth quarter rent collections were at 92% and rising by the week.*" said Tom O'Hern, CEO of Macerich in their recent Earnings call.


## The declining trend of brick-and-mortar stores and shopping malls in general

That's a big one and this has been a much bigger trend as the pandemic forced some people to buy things online. This trend is also not new at all as [this Vox article shows very well](https://www.vox.com/recode/21561046/death-rebirth-department-stores-retail-charts).

But the silver lining is that as some retail stores are going bankrupt, the big shopping centers are getting stronger from having less competition. And since Macerich has mostly big shopping centers, that's pretty good for them.

## What about the bankrupt stores in the near future

Green Street Advisors expects "about a little more than half of all mall-based department stores to close by the end of 2021."

That can be a big problem but  they seem to be prepared for it. They're planning on doing some mixed-use development and I like it. Doug said in their most recent earnings call :

> However, we know our shoppers want more than just traditional retail. And that's why we continue to focus on bringing alternative uses to our campuses and not just retail. Uses like office, residential, hospitality, medical, wellness, education, fitness, grocery, service and even storage, and that's why we continue to refer to our properties as town centers because that's what they're becoming. They're transformational and will be something for everyone. And they have to be because that's what our modern-day shopper wants.

What makes me even more optimistic is that most of the estate they own is in California (25.8%) and New York (23.1%). Those are very high density locations which are the most promising places for redevelopment or for mixed-use purposes.

## The repurpose of their buildings 

That's great to know that they're *planning* on "bringing alternative uses to [their] campuses" but how faisible is it and how much will that help them?

First, let's see what Macerich could convert its buildings to :

- Offices but there's a lot of uncertainty in this area. We're in the middle of a big shift in this regard which might benefit them or not.
- Other retail stores but jesus christ this market is not doing good right now and has not been doing well years before the pandemic.
- Industrial complexes like warehouses are booming right now thanks to e-commerce and the pandemic. This looks really promising if they go down that road but they need to do this quickly and strategically as all locations are not necessarily interesting. 
- Housing which a lot of real estate have mixed feelings about.

Or Macerich could do another interesting thing : mixed-use development. 

> It is a type of urban development, urban planning and/or a zoning type that blends residential, commercial, cultural, institutional, or entertainment uses into one space, where those functions are to some degree physically and functionally integrated, and that provides pedestrian connections.

Most of the estate they own is in California (25.8%) and New York (23.1%). So let's evaluate their possibilities in those locations that they've invested in. 

**California**

Let's start with California and use [the Allen Matkins/UCLA Anderson 2021 winter forecast](https://www.allenmatkins.com/anderson-forecast/allen-matkins-ucla-anderson-forecast-california-cre-survey.html). They've polled a lot of real estate professionals in California and here are the results :

They're pretty pessimistic about offices ROI today but they're confident that demand will increase. HOWEVER, "*the panelists believe that newly built space, in addition to that freed by companies reducing their existing space, will outstrip any near-term increased demand for office space*". Outch! Right in the feels!

Ok so not offices how about retail spaces? That one is short : "*62% of panelists indicated that they will not develop any new properties in the coming 12 months*".

Also :

> Overall, the level of new retail property construction is expected to significantly decline from 2020 through 2023; and some existing space, lacking sufficient demand, will be converted to other uses.

However, for the industrial space market, they're really optimistic : "*approximately 30 percent of the panelists stated that the experience of the recession has caused them to consider increasing the amount of development they will undertake.*".

They're also expecting that the housing market will grow steadily when the economy rebounds.

So I'm pretty optimistic for California if they need to repurpose their buildings : they could turn those spaces into housing or warehouses/industrial complexes or in mixed-use schemes.

And how about Ney York??

**New York**

Well... The short-term outlook is not that pretty!

In end of July 2020, Metro Manhattan reports that [Office sales have dropped 58%](https://www.metro-manhattan.com/blog/report-new-york-city-office-sales-drop-58-during-lockdown/) and [retail sales activity dropped 78%](https://www.metro-manhattan.com/blog/report-retail-sales-activity-drops-78-during-nyc-lockdown/) during the lockdown.

[Also](https://therealdeal.com/2020/10/19/new-yorks-cre-woes-could-spread-nationwide-investors/) :

> Citing Trepp, the Journal reported that more than $3 billion worth of loans backing commercial property in the five boroughs are delinquent, and loans in creditor negotiations amount to an additional $4 billion.

Finally, a lot of people are leaving the city because i) it's the epicenter of the pandemic and ii) it's a very dense city that was attractive because most of the activity is there. Now that people can work from home, they're no longer trapped in the city and [110,00 people left during the lockdown as a result](https://www.mymove.com/moving/covid-19/coronavirus-moving-trends/).

So all of this hurts offices, housing market and retail stores (because less people means less sales) *in the short term*.

For the long term, long story short, that's going to be the same as California but they will need to repurpose a lot more buildings as the situation is much worse in New York.

**An the rest of the commercial real estate though?**

There's [a nice report](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/financial-services/commercial-real-estate-outlook.html) by Deloitte. The key messages summarize it well but I encourage you to read the whole thing as this is pretty interesting not only for Macerich but for all REIT investing in shopping centers in the US.

## Conclusion

Macerich is pretty undervalued right now with a maket cap close to $2bn. It's pretty understandable because of the situation it is in right now : their debt is pretty important and commercial real estate is in terrible state right now in general. But their finances getting better as of end 2020, their occupancy approaching 90%, their interesting plans for unoccupied stores and the promising long-term outlook in California and New York (the 2 locations they're mostly invested in) shows a very good upside while the downside seems to be already priced in._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ TBT 6/18 20c This is a bet on reflation!

WFC over 80x

C around 12.5x

TFC is 17.5x

USB is 15.5x

PNC is 9.5x

COF is 23x

Ignoring the outlier of WFC...our median is around 15.5x

If UBS gets priced at 15.5x we get an increase in share value from $15.40 to $28.  This is an 82% increase.  I think this will happen thru actions of UBS themselves because they’ve initiated a 3yr stock buyback program, valued at $4.5 Billion and they plan to buyback $1.1 Billion in the first quarter.  The total buyback would reduce the amount of outstanding shares by around 300M.  Thus increasing the share price to around $18.33 at current price to earning.

However by reducing the amount of outstanding shares...it will significantly reduce dividend expense, and exponentially increase institutional value (while also lining the pockets of the execs including the new CEO - Ralph Hamers). Rumor is the new CEO was brought in to bring UBS into the digital future.

This was my first stocks ever purchased and although I had some emotional attachment to it. This time I had to let her go. 

I remeber sitting in my personal finance profs lecture, he said one thing that really resonated with me. 

“Children, I want each of you to borrow $500 from your parents (he said with a sinful grin), throw that into the market and have fun with it. You will probably lose, in fact you will loose it and when you do you will either never trade again or make it your life mission to learn what you did wrong”

5 years and some very bad decisions later I think I finally got the idea of what other retards on here mean when they say selling at the top!

Don’t worry, I’ll probably blow it all up on weeklies. Also this is TFSA money so double fuck you to the man and the system. 😎 

If you didn’t sell Wednesday just know you are not alone. Fear not because in roughly 2-3 years you too will have another opportunity to find a new generation of bag holders to offload your shares to. And when that happens you know I will fomo right in and help you unload those bags 💼

# **Stimulus prospects could boost the stock market and interest rates in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/12/stimulus-prospects-could-boost-the-stock-market-and-interest-rates-in-the-week-ahead.html)**
*****
> The prospects of a big government spending program could continue to boost the stock market and put upward pressure on interest rates in the week ahead.
*****
> Earnings season is beginning to wind down, but some big names have yet to report.
*****
> Walmart’s earnings on Thursday should provide a good window into the consumer, as should the government’s retail sales report for January, also expected Wednesday.
*****
> The Federal Reserve on Wednesday afternoon releases minutes from its last meeting, and investors will dig into those for any insight into the central bank’s view on inflation.
*****
> # Two dominant themes amid stimulus prospects
> Inflation and rising interest rates have been two dominant themes for investors recently and have become increasingly so as the market has upgraded its view of how much fiscal coronavirus stimulus could be signed into law.
*****
> “The market is waiting to see how big the package is going to be. It’s going to be important. They can get it through reconciliation,” said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial.
*****
> Krosby said that Democrats could pass the stimulus under budget reconciliation, which means they could approve it with a simple majority instead of relying on negotiations with Republicans.
*****
> Some in the markets had anticipated a package of $1 trillion or less if there was a negotiated deal, but that now looks unlikely. Strategists have changed their view on the proposed $1.9 trillion package.
*****
> “There is less pushback to President Biden’s proposed stimulus from moderate Democrats than we expected, so a price tag of around $1.5 trillion seems likely, which is higher than we initially thought,” noted Cornerstone Macro policy analysts.
*****
> They say they expect a bill to come to the floor during the week of Feb. 22, and that it could become law by the first week of March. Investors will stay focused on its progress through Congress.
*****
> Market pros expect the bigger the spending package, the larger the pop will be in economic growth in the near term. That has helped send Treasury yields, which move opposite price, to higher levels.
*****
> It has also increased concerns about inflation.
*****
> # Inflation and rising yields
In the past week, the 10-year yield — a key benchmark — touched 1.2% for the first time since March. It reached that level briefly early in the week but returned to it in the final hour of trading Friday.
*****
> Yields are rising on optimism for an improving economy, but also as inflation expectations also move higher.
*****
> “If you think about the big drivers, they’re related - vaccines, stimulus and inflation,” said Michael Schumacher, head of rate strategy at Wells Fargo Securities. “If there’s more talk out of D.C. about moving the stimulus package forward, that sets the stage for yields to go up.”
*****
> The market is concerned about the economy running hotter, since it could be a trigger to change Fed policy.
*****
> At the same time, the Fed has said it would tolerate inflation above its 2% target.
*****
> Krosby of Prudential Financial said the market will also pay attention to the producer price index Wednesday even though it is not typically a big factor.
*****
> “Because there’s such a debate on inflationary trends, I know the CPI [consumer price index] came in comfortable, but the producer price index is coming in and we’ll see if that has eased,” she said.
*****
> “Obviously supply chains are being reestablished and inventories are building,” said Krosby.
*****
> Consumer inflation was running at an annual pace of 1.4% in January.
*****
> # Housing statistics
Housing data is also dominant on the calendar in the holiday-shortened week.
*****
> The National Association of Home Builders releases its housing market index data on Wednesday, a measurement of sentiment around market conditions for new home sales.
*****
> On Thursday, the government will issue data on pending home sales and building permits. Finally, the National Association of Realtors will release existing home sales data on Friday.
*****
> Upcoming hearing on GameStop and short squeezes
Stocks were higher in the past week, with energy, tech and financials as the best performers. The S&P 500 rose 1.2%, ending the week at 3,934.
*****
> There were some market hot spots, like cannabis shares which became the latest target of the Reddit trading community. The stocks shot higher Wednesday, adding to already lofty gains in recent weeks before giving up some of those gains.
*****
> Investors will also be focused on the Thursday hearing before the House Financial Services Committee on the wild trading recently in GameStop and other heavily-shorted names.
*****
> Robinhood’s CEO is expected to testify, as are executives from Melvin Capital Management and Citadel.
*****
> The frenzied activity in some small and shorted stocks has raised concerns about the market becoming overheated. But Ari Wald, head of technical analysis at Oppenheimer, said the broader market’s advance is intact.
*****
> “Overall, it’s a bull market. I think the steadiness of the advance is underappreciated,” Wald said. He said the market technicals are healthy. Breadth is broad-based and there’s cyclical leadership.
*****
> “The low-volatility, high-dividend paying sectors are at risk,” said Wald. Utilities and consumer staples stocks, which both fit that category, were lower on the week.
*****
> The market was also awaiting the outcome of the Senate impeachment trial of President Donald Trump, and it is not expected to react.

> # Presidents' Day Seasonality

> The US equity market will be closed on Monday in observance of the Presidents' Day holiday. Since 1971 when the Uniform Monday Holiday Act set the third Monday in February, rather than on George Washington's birthday (February 22nd) as the Federal holiday, equity market performance during the week of Presidents' Day has been pretty mixed. From the Friday before President's Day through the Friday after, the S&P 500 has traded higher half the time for an average decline of 5 bps. Taking a closer look, in the chart below we show the median returns by day for each trading day in Presidents' week. Tuesday and Thursday have both averaged declines of 13 bps and 7 bps, respectively. Wednesday averages flat performance but the S&P 500 has only been higher 40% of the time. Despite weakness throughout most of the week, equities have tended to catch a bid by week's end with an average 6 bps gain on Friday with a move higher 58% of the time.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021221-Presidents-Day3f.png))**

> In the charts below, we show the average intraday performance of the S&P 500 during Presidents' Day week since 1983 when our intraday data begins. We also include looks for years when the S&P 500 was up and down YTD headed into the holiday. Again, the general pattern has been a steady drift lower until Friday when the S&P 500 has tended to rebound. We would note that the Friday rebound is not an all-day event. As shown, performance is pretty flat in the first several hours of trading with the biggest ramp higher occurring in the final of hours of tradings. That pattern is also consistent for both up and down years, though, in years that the S&P 500 was down YTD headed into the holiday there was a bit of a rebound midweek which was reversed by the end of the week.

Since 1990, Tuesday after Presidents’ Day has been strongest for the S&P 500 with 18 gains and 13 losses for median gain of 0.12% but with an average loss of –0.23%. DJIA also has more gains than losses on the Tuesday after, but NASDAQ is a net loser down 18 of 31 years with and average loss of –0.49% and a median loss of –0.11%.

> Wednesday is all red for all three major averages. NASDAQ and S&P 500 have more losses, but DJIA has a larger average loss. On the Wednesday after the Presidents’ Day holiday DJIA is down 16 of 31 with an average loss of –0.07% and a median decline of –0.10%. S&P 500 is down 18 of 31, average –0.02%, median –0.10% and NASDAQ is down 17 of 31, average –0.01%, median –0.09%.

> # Why Bulls Will Like The Year Of The Ox

> “Bulls make money, bears make money, and pigs get slaughtered.” Old Wall Street saying.

> The Chinese New Year (often called the Lunar New Year) will kick off Friday, February 12, and with it will begin the Year of the Ox. Although we would never suggest investing based on the zodiac signs—it is important to note that the Year of the Ox has historically been quite strong for equities. Not to mention we are saying goodbye to the year of the Rat. Good riddance to the Rat, as the last two years of the Rat were 2008 and 2020, not the best years for many reasons!

> Since the Chinese New Year typically starts between late-January and mid-February, we looked at the 12-month return of the S&P 500 Index starting at the end of January dating back to 1950. And wouldn’t you know it? The Year of the Ox has been up more than 13% on average (with a median advance of nearly 18%); suggesting bulls are smiling indeed!

> “The year of the Ox is the second of the 12 animal signs of the Chinese zodiac, and the Ox is considered a symbol of diligence, persistence, and honesty. Equity returns indeed are quite persistent during the Ox, as it is the third best return out of the 12 Zodiac signs,” explained LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.

> The LPL Chart of the Day shows how all the 12 Zodiac signs have done historically, with the Goat, Tiger, and Ox as the best, while the Rooster and Snake have been the worst.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2.10.21-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**

> We want to stress that no one should invest purely based on the zodiac signs. This relationship is random and the sample size is small. Still, here’s hoping that the Year of the Ox plays out well for the bulls once again!

> # Short Interest Update

> Yesterday, bi-weekly short interest data was released for the period ending January 30th. In the chart below, we show the Russell 3000 broken up into deciles based on short interest as a percent of the float at the end of 2020 and these decile's stock's median change in short interest from then to yesterday's release. As shown, with the short squeeze episode playing out in the second half of January, the stocks that came into 2020 the most heavily shorted have seen the biggest declines in short interest. That decile of what had been the most heavily shorted names has seen short interest as a percent of float fall for a median of 2.65 percentage points. Deciles two and three have similarly seen sizable declines, though, they are far smaller than those of the most shorted stocks. On the other hand, the decile of the least shorted stocks is the only one that has seen the median short interest reading move higher since the end of 2020.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021020-SI-Deciles-F.png))**

> In the table below, we show the stocks that currently have the highest short interest as a percent of float. After the historic move higher, short squeeze poster child GameStop (GME) is no longer the Russell 3000's most heavily shorted name! Having dropped over 100 percentage points since the start of the year, only 42.61% of shares are now short compared to 43.57% for Gogo (GOGO); currently the most shorted stock in the index. GOGO has actually seen its shorts come off a bit this year as well but that decline has been far more modest of only a little more than one percentage point. Of the other stocks in the index, only Tanger Outlets (SKT) and Dillard's (DDS) also currently have more than 40% of the float sold short.

> On the January 27th closing high, GME was up 1,744.53% year to date. But with the short squeeze unwinding, the stock has fallen over 86%. Others of this cohort have similarly seen big reversals of their earlier surges. For example, National Beverage (FIZZ) had doubled YTD at the time of the GME peak, but since then it has been cut by 33.78%. Not all of these have been losers since the pinnacle of short selling though. Fulgent Genetics, have similarly seen big gains of over 30%.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021020-SI-Table-Current-High.png))**

> Given GME came into the year with an absurd number of shares sold short, the squeeze has resulted in it being the biggest decliner in terms of short interest of any Russell 3000 stock. Short interest as a percentage of float has fallen over 100 percentage points YTD. The next biggest drop came from BigCommerce Holdings (BIGC) and Dillard's (DDS) which both saw larger than 50 percentage point drops. Of the rest of the top twenty biggest decliners, a baker's dozen have seen short interest drop by at least 20 points. Additionally, of these stocks that have seen short interest fall the most, only three—nCino (NCNO), Berkeley Lights (BLI), and 3D Systems (DDD)—now have a single-digit short interest as a percent of float.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021020-SI-Table-Decline.png))**

> Given the massive short squeezes, there are far more stocks that now have a lower short interest as a percent of float than at the start of the year. In fact, of the Russell 3000 stocks, 1887 have seen declines in short interest compared to only 1146 that have seen an increase. In the table below, we show the twenty stocks to have seen the biggest increases in SIPF since the start of the year. As shown, there is only one, International Game Technology (IGT), that has seen short interest rise by double digits since the end of 2020.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021020-SI-Table-Increase.png))**

> Retailers notably dominate the list of stocks with the biggest declines in short interest. To quantify this, in the chart below we show the aggregate number of shorted shares as a percent of total float for each industry group as of the most recent short interest data and the end of 2020. As shown, just as it was at the start of the year, retailers remain the most heavily shorted industry group, but it has greatly improved with only 5.86% short compared to 8.15% at the end of 2020. That is the only industry group to have seen short interest drop by a full percentage point or more. The industry group to have experienced the next largest decline was Transportation with aggregate short interest falling from 5.08% to 4.13%. Conversely, there are two industries, Banks and Materials, that have higher short interest as a percent of float than they did at the end of 2020.

# DISCUSS!

What are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?

*****

I hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great week ahead r/wallstreetbets._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Let's talk about LoanDepot (LDi) and it's potential upside movement in the next few weeks. Alright guys, I know you are all busy trying to find the next meme stock to make everyone lose money, but I think LDi is a legit GROWTH company that's going to at least double over the next month. 

&#x200B;

# What is LoanDepot?

Loan Depot is the second largest nonbank Mortgage Originator in the united states. Having gone public in just the last few days. It's taken a similar approach that other mortgage originator IPOs have gone in the last few years, [a severely underpriced IPO](https://www.housingwire.com/articles/loandepot-raises-just-54m-in-downsized-ipo/) LDi isnt too far behind Rocket Mortgage, arguably the #1 in the space right now. LDI has a 3 billion dollar market cap, **compared to Rocket's 40 billion dollar market cap.** Even though LDI is more storefront focused and RKT is dominant with their online presence and super bowl ads, if these companies are even in the same universe, **there is still massive upside for LDI.** Sure, we have to take into consideration that Rocket absolutely dumped right after it's IPO after an initial pop, but the company was already fully valued. LDI is not. I'm setting a $100 price target after a few months. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

# Another interesting catalyst

&#x200B;

Loan depot is about to have an earnings call on the [18th of this month](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/loandepot-inc-report-fourth-quarter-130000039.html). It's my understanding that they don't even need to do this as they have just gone public. This could be a huge announcement, or some forward looking statements/guidance that they are releasing to burn the underwriters who severely underpriced their company and left them with just 54 million in cash after years of trying to go public. Mortgage originations are at multi year highs, and interest rates are dirt cheap, so im not thinking that this is a multi-year growth stock, however a hold for a few months might have a huge payoff. In the end, make your own decision but I really think this one is a no brainer. What do you guys think?

**What is Cloudflare?**

Cloudflare is going to make a leading player in next-generation computing. From their blog: [https://blog.cloudflare.com/rendering-react-on-the-edge-with-flareact-and-cloudflare-workers/](https://blog.cloudflare.com/rendering-react-on-the-edge-with-flareact-and-cloudflare-workers/). Excerpt:

>“Imagine you’re the maintainer of a high-traffic media website, and your DNS is already hosted on Cloudflare.  
Page speed is critical. You need to get content to your audience as quickly as possible on every device. You also need to render ads in a speedy way to maintain a good user experience and make money to support your journalism...  you’re going to need to pay for some beefy servers to be able to handle spikes in traffic and respond to requests in a timely manner...Cloudflare Workers allow you to run your code on the edge quickly, efficiently and at scale. Instead of paying for a server to host your code, you can host it directly inside the datacenter”

Seriously, this is cool, and it’s only beginning. Cloudflare is innovating every day. Their customers absolutely love them. As a software engineer, they have already have some products are there that are pretty cool like Cloudflare Pages and Cloudflare Workers. I think what’s going to help them into a powerhouse is this:

>Over the coming months, we’ll be working on integrating Workers and Pages into a seamless experience. It’ll work the exact same way Pages does: just write your code, git push, and we’ll deploy it for you. The only difference is, it won’t just be your frontend, it’ll be your backend, too. And just to be clear: this is not just for stateless functions. With Workers KV and Durable Objects, we see a huge opportunity to really enable any web application to be built on this platform.

Soon, developers will be able to make full-stack applications end-to-end using Cloudflare’s network. Cloudflare will handle all of the annoying stuff about development including hosting and deployment. And they’ll allow developers of all size to instantly scale their application across the entire United States, all while increasing developer productivity and satisfaction.

If you’re not a developer, you probably didn’t understand most of that, but essentially, they’re making it so you can build entire applications using solely their infrastructure. This is actually genuinely cool, and will save the average developer tons of time and money.

I can easily see how this propels their growth even faster than 50%. And if this thing inches up to 60-65% YoY as it expands it’s profitability... 🚀🚀🚀

(And even if it doesn’t, and stays at 50%, it will still 🚀 but slower. Regardless, it’s going up)

“BuT iT tAnKeD oN EaRnInGs”

That drop is an absolute blessing to those who aren’t long. Plus it’s hardly a tank when it’s at ATHs if you exclude the one week in its history where it was higher

Its earnings was good, and to those who haven’t read it, [do so](https://www.cloudflare.com/press-releases/2021/cloudflare-announces-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-year-2020-financial-results/) besides relying on a stock’s immediate reaction. To the 90% who will completely ignore that sentence:

>Revenue growth was 50% YOY which is consistent with the last 3 earnings

Revenue right now is $125 million. Doesn’t sound like much at first, but those of us know the power of compound interest knows how fast that number will be pumped. 5 years from now, that’s $1 billion a year. In 8 it will be $3 billion

Yes, 5-8 years is a long time. This is a buy and hold stock. That’s why I’m long Jan 21 115c.

The revenue and growth isn’t the impressive part. The margins are

>GAAP gross profit was $96.9 million, or 76.9% gross margin, compared to $65.7 million, or 78.3%, in the fourth quarter of 2019.

High 70s margins is absolutely incredible. And it's consistent quarter to quarter. That means once NET does reach profitability, they’re going to be **raking** in dough

That being said, NET isn’t profitable yet, which is pretty much the only argument bears can muster (that and high valuation but more on that later). Keep in mind they’ve been screeching the same thing since 2019 and that hasn’t stopped it. But once profitability is out of the way, there’s nothing stopping it from being a $300 stock. Here’s why:

\- Like I mentioned earlier, their losses are decreasing and if my hypothesis is correct, they will reach profitability by early ‘22

\- Currently 15% of the internet goes through Cloudflare’s network and that number is increasing. Literally, 1/6th of the entire internet infrastructure is worth $25 billion. In comparison, a bike company (PTON) is worth double that.

\- Boomer companies who need to replace their shitty infrastructure will likely turn to Cloudflare due to their reliable secure networks with guaranteed security. Not to mention their prices are dirt-cheap compared to their competitors.

—-

**CONS**

The only cons are people concerned with profitability (covered already) and evaluation (priced at 60x sales which tbf is absolutely outrageous). However I think this is still short-sighted. As long as the bull market remains intact (big IF, but I’m a bull so as long interest rates are 0), there’s no reason to believe the rocket rally will end. As we see with SHOP and TSLA, traditional valuations don’t matter if the product has a dream, vision, and story, which with Cloudflare’s “Build a Better Internet” shtick, I think it does. Especially because customers actually like their product and Cloudflare will continue to innovate and build upon Cloudflare’s already enormous Cloudflare network.

This stock already got [multiple](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/cloudflare-drops-despite-multiple-price-target-upgrades) analysts upgrades. The drop was a blessing to those who aren’t in. Start investing in quality and innovation; $85/share is a whole lot less than $300 which is where they will be by 2025 (I want to say 2022, but I’m trying to be conservative here).

Seriously, give this a second look. I’ve been playing NET since 37. It’s a shit stock that consolidates for months, then rockets 30% in a week. Earnings being great (and not excellent) is the only reason NET hasn’t done its 30% move. I’m completely assured that it will soon_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ GME; when diamonds break (missing another 25k loss expired last week) _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ COTY dd - Makeup Never Dies Below is my DD on why COTY will be comeback play that combines new growth and returning revenues post-covid.

**What is COTY?** Coty is the makeup/cosmetics king. With its subsidiaries, it develops, manufactures, markets, and distributes fragrances, cosmetics, skin care, nail care, and both professional and retail hair care products. Coty owns around 77 brands as of 2018. These brands include: Covergirl, Burberry, Gucci, Calvin Klein, Boss, Chloe ETC. You can google the rest if you are curious.

**Why are they beaten down?** One major reason: With the pandemic, a lot of girls have adopted work from home/stay home lifestyles. Basically, alot of girls are too lazy and don't find the necessity to put on any makeup or perfume if they are just sitting at home with their sweatpants on. 

**Recovery/Online Growth**: Makeup/skincare isn't going anywhere, this isn't a dying industry. Also this has jump started COTY's e-commerce sales though their retail sales were hurting. According to their recent 4Q earnings call they are reporting that their percentage of net revenue through e-commerce has DOUBLED from pre-covid. As they invest in their e-commerce and online sales partnerships I can see this growing into a cosmetics/skincare version of Chewy. 

**Asian Expansion**: They are investing heavily in the Asian market and are seeing huge revenue gains from their previous investment. China is a huge market for cosmetics, especially premium skincare brands. Trust me, from dating alot of asian girls, they use makeup and skincare like its CRACK. They are addicted to the stuff. According to the CEO they have seen a whopping 40% Year Over Year increase in their prestige brand skincare retail sales in China. Considering again the lockdown environment this would probably be magnitudes higher if it were a non-pandemic year. Another sign of huge potential in Asia, is their Gucci skincare brand partnership with a Chinese Influencer had over 100million digital convos, the amount of skincare addicts in asia is insane and COTY will be making bank.

**New Leadership** - Sue Nabi new CEO, appointed July 2020, is a growth innovator in the beuty industry. Before joining COTY she oversaw double digit growth 4 years in a row in both Loreal Paris and Lancome. She also launched a booming green new-age skincare brand back in 2014. She is exactly what COTY needs, a younger smarter visionary CEO with the guts and experience to turn this retail focused blob into a online growth juggernaut.

**Price predictions**: I believe by eoy COTY will be back to 15 just as a recovery play. As they further expand their asian and online presense I could see them getting valued more as a growth play over the next 2 years. Growth price target: 50+

Position: 3000 shares @ 6.68$, 25 10$ Jan 2022 calls_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for the week beginning February 15th, 2021 _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ You might consider entering $ATVI Hi there, 2nd post because my first one was shit.

Welcome my retards and Yolo artists,

As many of you know, blizzcon 2021 is coming and here a few prediction from my side:

Wow, the biggest IP of Activision Blizzard will get a new major content patch in April-June, making people re subscribe to experience the content.

Diablo 4 will get a release date with pre ordering enabled surging in sweet millions. 

Overwatch 2 will be released this year so more millions for them. 

Hearthstone will get a new battle pass in the next few months so again a few bucks more. 


Q: Activision Blizzard has a 80B market cap, will D4 even rise it high? 
A: probably yes. If we look at the Release of shadow lands and many people returning to wow buying a monthly subscription and the expansion for ~60$ has increased the price of the stock from 80$ to something above 90$ now blizzcon pre-orders had pushed it to 100$/share. Diablo 4 might at least push the worth of the stock by 10$ because I assume 90% of the wow fanbase are also Diablo fans. 

All in all I think investing in Activision-Blizzard is a no brainer at the given time. Since the release of classic Wow servers and shadowlands they have been slowly but steady regaining worth and if they won't fuck up during an esports event a la Blitzchung, it is pretty safe to assume the stonks will go up to at least 120$/stonk.

I am not a financial adviser, do not bet any money you are not willing to loose. I am a retard. 
See ya._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ AMD and Intel DD With the pandemic still going on and everyone needing more computers than ever and the ongoing trade war with China, there is a severe Chip shortage.

On Thursday, the CEOs of the major Chip producers (Intel, AMD, QCOM) have sent a letter to Biden that he should sent out an executive order to adress this shortage. ([https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-11/biden-team-pledges-aggressive-steps-to-address-chip-shortage](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-11/biden-team-pledges-aggressive-steps-to-address-chip-shortage))

I see three different scenarios:

1. Biden gives an executive order to build improve and increase the domestic chip foundries. This would be most bullish for Intel, since they are the only company with foundries in the USA. This would also help AMD and QCOM, since they would most likely that access to cheaper chips.
2. Biden lifts the trade restrictions set on semiconductors. This would mean that AMD and QCOM would get access to cheaper chips, but it would not solve the shortage of silicon so it is unlikely to happen. This would be bullish for AMD and Qualcomm, but it would not change the situation for Intel.
3. Biden does not do anything and the shortage will continue. If Biden does this nothing will be changed, it will be neither good or bad from Intel and AMD. AMD will still keep growing at a massive rate and Intel will still be a cash cow.

So regardless of what happens, I am very bullish on the semiconductor industry. I expect Biden to start ramping up semiconductor manufacturing the USA, because of his tough stance on China. At the moment almost all of the semiconductor industry is relying on Taiwan, and with the Chinese involvement in that country, it is very likely that their is bipartisan support for increasing semiconductor manufacturing domestically.

all you autists looking "for the next GME". well guess what, there is no next GME. that milk's spilt, sour and cold. but there's a company out there so boring, so \*\*\*\*ing uninteresting, that just like GME is has strong value characteristics, and has over 100% short float, and it's hiding in plain sight.

**UWMC**: stands for United Whole Mortgage C\*nts. they do things with mortgages. right now, the market doesn't really like things to do with mortgages, because its a cyclical business nearing its peak. it's pumping out great returns (maybe at this peak) and valued at only 5.5x P/E. the market don't care. Last earnings, the company reported EBITDA of $1.4B FOR THE QUARTER (whole market cap of only $15B). It also has a big boomer 4.5% dividend. This sh\*t is unloved just like your dross GME was, and like GME is actually a fly guy of a bizniz

**The set-up**: this was a former SPAC. I know, I know. Some of you apes held this when it was a SPAC, and now your diapers are in a twist because it didn't moon. Well, f\*\*\* off I don't care. You're not the only ones: HFs are short this guy like you wouldn't believe. THE FLOAT IS ONLY 6% OF THE ENTIRE MARKET CAP, and half of it is like by one institution that's in it for the long-term (Magnetar). That means the effective float is only 3%! Right now it's being manipulated like you wouldn't believe. This thing is a powder keg and it can explode in the shorts' face.

**The mooning**: There are huge numbers of calls at $15 and $17.5. If this thing gets anywhere close to them in a short period of time, the gamma squeeze could propel this thing to $50-60 in a week. If it doesn't. If it doesn't, you're holding an actual good clucking company at 5.5x PE, so you're brains wont be over your windshield like you late weed apes. Fundamentally it's probably worth $20-25, so you have an actual fundamental value play here too just as a back-up

**The play**: buy shares first! This thing has a squoze in it. Also buy 2/19 and 3/19 calls at $10-17.5

**DD link for short report**: [https://www.nakedshortreport.com/company/UWMC](https://www.nakedshortreport.com/company/UWMC)

**TLDR**: everyone hated GME. now every hates UWMC. UWMC is boring and doesn't get you high so you apes have missed it, but it has effective 100% short interest for tiny float (3%) of company, strong fundamentals and a squeeze that hasn't squoze, company worth double anyway but could easily run up 10x if the shorts get nuk'd

**Me**: in for 4,000 shares at $9.18. this is not financial advice. do your own diligence you cucks.

AMD has been in a recent downtrend since the start of january. However, the price action is starting to consolidate around 92 with a small run thats gonna run out of steam soon. 

The MACD just crossed at the -0.2 so the reversal may be weak. The Stoch also is more than halfway to oversold territory. Once it runs out of steam it may have its current 93 price as a support, if not the next support is at 89 ish

This means a little sideways action with the 95 resistance before retesting ATH. Now, i could be wrong, but i do not foresee any catalysts in the next weeks (feel free to chime in). 

Could breach ATH by next quarter. Wed have to see the price action then. 

This is wendys. I am not responsible for any bad trades yall make, this is just an opinion. 

PS: i could have sworn that this sub had a TA Flair. Oh well._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Analysis of the DJ average growth and the sub prime mortgage crisis of 2008 and how the current market isn't overvalued.🖕🌈🐻     So I had a theory I wanted to test out after listening to Cathie Woods recent interview and how she didn't feel like the market was overvalued. I dont want to watch it again to recap her reasons I forget but I liked it when I heard it. Every one on CNBC or basically any other market analysis is all 🌈🐻 doom and gloom because FEAR SELLS! Seriously ever buy tickets to a scary movie? Some people actually want to hear that shit so thats what they put out.

   That got me to thinking, what would the market look like today if greedy bankers hadn't given 5 interest only mortgages to every stripper in Vegas? Time to read charts and do mathmagic (yeah I'm actually on the spectrum and that gets my dick hard).

   According to this Zack's article: [here](https://finance.zacks.com/average-return-dow-jones-during-its-lifetime-3314.html)

   In the 91 years prior to 1987 the Dow Jones Industrial Average grew at an average rate of 4.3%. Overall rate over its 122 years in 5.42%, in a 25 year sample from 1987-2012 the DJ grew by 7.55%. What the fuck? Why almost double since 1987? In my personal opinion the early adoption of the personal computer by Wallstreet and the emergence of fast growth tech companies that the semiconductor gave birth to. In summary I've elected to use 7.55% for my calculations because we don't use the Pony Express or Wells Fargo to deliver stock certificates anymore(Buffett might still use WF lol).

   I'm going 20 years back here for a proper trend line, and it will segue into another related analysis for the second half. Starting in Y2K, thats the year 2000 for you Gen Zs, the DJIA was 10,729.38. Now let's use that 7.55% average year over growth and forecast the Dow today vs one with no housing collapse. 

DJ Current: 31,458.40

DJ No 2008: 49,746.08

   The fallout from the events in 2008 set the market trend line behind by 6 and a half years on the 7.55% model. My actual analysis of the 20 year sample I used finds a 6.54%, but that includes a -33.84% drop for '08. If you remove that event the growth rockets to 8.54%. So I feel like the 7.55% model is perfectly reasonable.

   In summation analysts(🌈🐻) have been screeching for the last half decade about how we are do for a market correction, and I agree! The market is attempting to correct losing a third of its value that took a century to build in one year!

This campaign has been largely led by large hedge funds. Without S&P inclusion, the story might have ended there with hedge funds trying to escape with their profits and leaving retail the bag. However, S&P inclusion presented these hedge funds with a much better option to close out their positions while also riding the stock down. The shares that hedge funds no longer wanted began to be picked up by passive funds leading to selloffs by the active funds which pushed prices to this level.

With passive funds holding the bag, the hedge funds which lead the rally seem to be attempting to push the price back down through a reverse gamma squeeze^(2).

No retail trader is buying 1m+ in deep OTM puts, this is an attempt by hedgies to push the price down.

We can also see this from the massive shift in options volume. $190B of calls open interest and over $250B of puts open interest, a massive put skew. This is especially significant because "To put it in context it is equal to the combined $AAPL and $AMZN bullish skew or if you’d rather to the combined  $BABA, $FB, $MSFT, $GOOG and $WMT combined." reflecting extremely bearish sentiment in an very very bullish market.

Once the reversal begins there will be nothing stopping it as OTM puts get less and less OTM. There are no shorts left to be squeezed and the bag holding passive funds which are largely barred from holding derivatives will have no way of rebalancing the options skew.

Sun, the 30 year-old entrepreneur who bought $10 million worth of GameStop Corp. at the height of its Reddit-fueled rally, is predicting a paradigm shift in investing as younger people swarm into financial assets.

Sun said he’s prepared to hold onto his GameStop shares that he purchased near the highs late last month 💎🖐 in an effort to tap into the adrenaline-charged rush that lured retail investors into so-called meme stocks. He also bought $1 million in AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. and a further $1 million in silver. The GameStop position is now worth just $2 million, Sun said.

“I think I’m going to hold. Even if I lose money on the GME stock, I still believe this is a paradigm shift,” Sun said in an interview with Bloomberg Television. “In the past we all followed the advice from the financial analysts, and these days people are going to make their own decisions.”

Don’t worry guys, there is GREAT advice from Yahoo! Finance for all of you paper hand apes out there. 

Are you down thousands of dollars on GME, AMC, BB, or other meme stocks you got from WSB*? ALL you have to do is just cut your losses so that you can get tax-loss benefits and offset your gains. That’s it. Just sell at a loss.

From his wiki

 “Chen became CEO of Sybase in 1998.[12] As Sybase had been a strong competitor of Oracle, but had become a "dead company" after failing to enter the market for enterprise applications, as Oracle had. 
Chen and his team proceeded to reinvent Sybase as an "enabler of the 'unwired enterprise'".[12] In so doing, Chen and his team led a re-invention strategy that that led to the turnaround of the company into a profitable mobile device producer,[13] valued at $6 billion in 2010.[12]
Sybase achieved strong financial performance and shareholder returns under Chen's leadership”

Synapse’s story sounds familiar to blackberry’s. 

Chen’s done this before successfully and blackberry’s direction since losing the smartphone market has been successful and undervalued imo 

Now they’ve shook hands with Facebook and settled their dispute and shook hands with Amazon to develop and market software for cloud-connected vehicles, obviously the future for the automotive industry. Their security is industry leading at the moment, it’s not just automotive ...etc etc etc there’s lots of DD been posted explaining in detail

The **Intercontinental Exchange** (ticker **$ICE**) is a company that owns exchanges all over the world including the New York Stock Exchange which is by far the largest. They make money by providing a marketplace and information services, so they're the Ebay of stocks. Except they make money getting companies listed rather than used clothes.

Going off the books, they're a little overvalued right now. Morningstar places their fair value at $99 and they closed at $111.02 today while their PE ratio is 29.67. However, they have steadily grown these last few years and I expect them to continue for one vital reason: A whole lot more investors are on the market.

Both with the explosion of discount brokers last year and the explosion of this sub in the last month means there's actually more money on the market. As new investors dip their toes in the water and/or recover from the pandemic unemployment that number will go up. Also, the rate of IPOs are also rising for the very reason there's a lot more interest in stocks now. The exchange's service is essential to the market so there's great security in that only the total collapse of civilization will make this company flop. The rising popularity of ETFs is also due to the market as a whole being good and growing. $ICE also consistently meets or exceeds earnings, but that's mostly an effect of having long term contracts for data and knowing in advance who's IPOing.

I know I know, it sound like a typical WSB post, but let me present you the proof.

RAVI is a weird looking indicators with boring white bars. They move up and down all day without anything interesting happening. But ***sometimes*** they change color. ***Sometimes*** they become red, or green. And when they change color, you go balls deep.

That's right, every time it becomes a certain color, you essentially **YOLO** your entire account.

As you can see on this example, we have mostly useless white bars, and then 4(5) colored bars.

When the bars become green, it means you sell. If it becomes red, you buy.

Sometimes the next bar will be the same color, in which case double your position, or just wait if you already YOLO'd.

I checked a few days worth of market, and to my big suprise, RAVI was right 100% of the time, with the worst result being only a 0.2% gain instead of a significant one.

Now, don't go full retard. As soon as your bet confirms, exit when the time is right, or else you almost always will slowly bleed off your gains.

RAVI only fires 2-3 times a day, but on volatile stocks it can yield great 2-8% trades, like in this case.

Do NOT rely on this indicator for ALL stocks, choose carefully which ones are worth your time.

# This is not financial advice, wife's boyfriend funny_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ CureVac (CVAC) making the coronavirus vaccine for Europoors and beyond I’m new, sort of. I joined a couple of years back and got turned off by all the rockets so I unsubscribed. I was reminded of WSB recently when I read a bestof post about someone who made enough money to pay for his dog’s surgery. WSB, making money? I got a flash back of all the rockets, of how I thought going long on Tesla was dumb, and cried inside when I compared to the stock price today. So I re-joined and promptly lost 2.5k with GME (my fault, got greedy). I regained it in weed plus a little extra, so we’re good. 



What to do with this fresh money?



I got curious about CureVac today as I read that they *“announced initiation of a rolling submission with the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for CVnCoV, the company’s mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine candidate, currently in late-stage clinical testing.”* I looked into it, here are my notes: 



CureVac (CVAC) is German biotech with 20 years of experience but new on the stock market (IPOed in August 2020, current market cap 21.4bn).



They developed a COVID mRNA vaccine (similar to Pfizer/Biontech and Moderna) but the CureVac can be shipped and stored at fridge temperature, a major logistics advantage compared to the others. It’s cheaper to store and transport and can also be used in poor countries that don't have the kind of cold storage the other mRNA vaccines need.



The vaccine is currently in phase 3 testing—a U.K. trial has finished enrolling 15,000 participants, and another global phase 2b/3 study aims to recruit more than 35,000 volunteers. (They already know it works and it’s safe so far; in Phase 3 they’re assessing how well it works plus more safety data.)



CureVac is in collaboration with the UK Government (the UK will provide them with scientific data regarding new strains), Bayer (to scale production of its vaccine, 160m doses) and GSK (to produce 100m doses and to jointly develop second generation vaccines).



The European Commission already has an order in for 405 million doses. It gave CureVac €75 million in funding to develop CVnCoV, adding to around €300 million provided by the German government.

The UK ordered 50m doses.



CureVac and partners expect to produce up to 300m doses in 2021 and up to 600m in 2022.



Whenever a new variant of the virus emerges, they can make a vaccine “update” in a matter of weeks. Furthermore, they're collaborating with GSK to make the second generation of vaccines (i.e. multivalent vaccines that cover multiple mutations of the coronavirus or multiple respiratory viruses). Such vaccines could become available 2022 subject to regulatory approval.



Other developments in the pipeline: rabies vaccine, and a couple of injectable drugs for skin and lung cancers in Phase 1 clinical trials (preliminary tests in humans). 



**Financials**

Being a newly listed company, there’s not much data to go with. I only found the *Third Quarter and First 9 Months 2020 Financial Results* on their website and didn’t look further. There’s probably a German website where you can find past balance sheet information for the company, but my German sucks. So I only go with this one report I found (first link in the list of sources). I nearly failed my accounting exam and probably only passed it because I cried, you better read the report yourself if you know how to read.


Comparison between Q1-Q3 2020 vs the same period in 2019:

Revenue: 43m (2020) vs 11m (2019)

Net loss: -71m vs -64m (despite spending 46m more in R&D in 2020)

Obviously, these are numbers before they start selling the vaccine (assuming it passes Phase 3). Trying to look at the future, I couldn’t find any info on the vaccine pricing or how much profit they expect to make per dose. But they’ve *“ruled out selling its inoculation at cost, arguing instead for an “ethical margin” for shareholders.”*. Comparatively, *“AstraZeneca and J&J have said they would not seek to profit from their vaccines, at least during the pandemic. “*



They have €892 million in cash as of September 30th, 2020 (from the German govt, the deal with GSK, the IPO and the grant/loan from the European Investment Bank). 



Major shareholders include the founder, the German government and one of the founders of SAP.



Position: [1 x Jan2023 115C](https://imgur.com/a/mJcge6P). 

I’m an Europoor. I barely had the money to make this one call. I have no qualifications in finance or pharma. Don’t listen to me. Rockets.

Edited for formatting._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ First trade of my life: Buy GME at $90, sell at $420.69. Am I doing it right? [https://i.imgur.com/9LiEEVz.png](https://i.imgur.com/9LiEEVz.png)

I got nothing done at work that week and I've had tension in my chest ever since. I'll be bag holding the other 100 shares for the rest of my life before I fucking sell for a penny less than $420.69, but I got my money back out and took a little profit. I had wanted to buy calls on the Monday instead of shares, but I was too fucking dumb to figure out where I can trade US options from Europe. I still don't know. I literally setup a trading account at like 2am the night before to try to catch a seat on the rocket.

Even greater than the little bit of profit and free shares... what I've really gained... is the feeling that if I dedicate myself to this from now on... if I really focus... I too could one day become retarded.

💎🙌 GME 💎🙌_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Roblox Listing Coming In March Thoughts? So according to many sites, it seems like Roblox is going to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange around March.

The company reported $613.9M of revenues for 2020’s first three quarters, up from a previously disclosed $588.7M. That helped narrow the company’s net loss for the year’s first nine months to $194.5M vs. a $213.3 million previously reported.

With a possible $29.5B valuation, what are your thoughts on this newly released information? How many of you are going to go in on this when it debuts?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Wallstreetbets I fucking love you _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Let’s talk taxes! I would hate for a fellow WSB member to get in trouble with Uncle Sam! PSA: for those who didn’t know, you have to pay taxes on your profits. If you don’t hold the stock for more than 12 months (capital gains law) then you will pay taxes at your prevailing tax bracket come tax time. Otherwise you only pay 15% on profits. 

So for all of you out there who made a shit ton on $GME and other meme stocks prepare to pay huge taxes on those. Especially if you have a Normal day job salary as well. I would hate to see a fellow WSB go to jail for not paying taxes. Don’t go spending that money quite yet because once tax season rolls around next may 2022 you might owe the government $50,000+ in taxes for that 6 figure profit you made off GameStop for example. Just hoping this doesn’t get deleted by the mods and can educate others. 

To get around this invest in companies that you want to hold for 12 months or more. Then you only pay 15% on taxes instead of potentially 60% (for top earners). Same goes for houses and any appreciating asset._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Dear CNBC _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ I can't believe I have to say this, but a lot of people need to hear it: THE STOCK MARKET ISN'T FAIR All I read now on "new WSB" is about how robinhood stopped the GME squeeze, and they "robbed" investors. "This was going to $1,000, we got robbed!" is every other damn post.

Now, personally, I don't buy that this is all a big conspiracy, and that all the brokers halted trading to save one hedge fund. As a long time trader (who has witnessed a lot of halts), it seems far more likely that the brokers were at risk of getting fucked, and they protected themselves. But, I won't get into that, because that's not the point of this post.

This is the point:

THE STOCK MARKET ISN'T FAIR. Never has been, never will be. For example:

1) Big money has access to so much information you don't have. They have access to order flows and shit that cost a fortune. They have entire departments and insiders that do nothing but research and investigate. Is that fair?

2) Big money trades on platforms like bloomberg terminals (and similar), and they can literally see more accurate prices and trade quicker than you. Is that fair?

3) Big money has access to advanced algos that you could never dream of accessing, that auto-trade for them. Is that fair?

4) Big money has so much money that they can literally alter the prices of stocks by buying/selling. They can rotate between stocks and ETFs that hold the stocks to remain invested while manipulating pricing. Is that fair?

I could literally write a 500 point list, but my point is clear: the shit ain't fair. It's no secret. As a retail trader, you are a little guppy punk-ass bitch in a big dick shark pool.

*But we all know that.* It's never been about being fair, it's about profiting from the landscape that we are in.

If you buy into GME at $50, and that shit goes to $500 in a matter of days, then you see some sketchy shit happening and think "wow the hedge funds and market makers are gonna put an end to this shit..." Then you hold until it crashes back down to $50 and cry "it's not fair," then you're a fucking idiot. I'm sorry, but that's the deal.

We know big money has the power to crash a stock, so if you see it happening, sell. Better yet, sell and switch to shorts, and play both sides. Don't lose all of your money and then claim the market isn't fair. No shit it isn't fair. What's your point? Profit off that unfairness, ya dumb bitch.

The millions of new WSBers all posting about how "it isn't fair" and "we got robbed," it's basically like a little bitch crime boss making a deal with the rival big dick crime boss, then crying because the big dick crime boss lied and stole his money. Hey, no shit. Criminals do that. If you're a crime boss, you know the other crime boss is probably fucking lying, so you hedge against his lies and use that shit against him. That's how it works.

And that's how it works here, too. In the criminal world, people lie to you. In the stock market, big money manipulates shit. You can punch the sky, or you can accept that and play the game with those realities in mind.

When I am in a trade, sure, I'm thinking about the fundamentals and future company performance. The news cycle. All the boring shit. But I'm *also* thinking about big money, retail traders, who is involved and how they are involved, and how all they will react to shifts in the stock price. You *have to,* because that's how the market ticks.

You only win by playing by the rules of the game, and the rules of this game are that the market is largely smoke and mirrors, and you'll never have even 1% of the knowledge or power that a typical hedge fund has. Don't fight it into bankruptcy like a fucking dongus. Play the game.

Am I being negative? Nah, I'm being realistic. You want to fight to make the market more free and fair? Go on. Fight to make it better. It's a good thing to do, and I support it. And I'll help you. But in the meantime, accept what the market is *right now.* Don't throw you and your family's money away as a moral martyr, saying "well i wouldn't have lost all my money if the market was different!" It's not different. It is what it is.

And if you legitimately can't disconnect yourself from that idealism, then it's probably just best not to trade. For your own sake._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Which weed ETF will provide most exposure to US market if weed becomes legalized in America? I've been researching the funds MJ, and THCX.  Look them up, and both graphs follow very closely.  There is a lot of crossover surely.  There are few American companies represented in each.  Seem to be pharmaceuticals, or tobacco industry.  My bet, is that weed will be legalized within the next year in America.  If this happens, I want to make sure I have maximum exposure to the US market for marijuana.  I am curious about other thoughts on which ETFs could accomplish this best.  I am not interested in political discussion.  I know this is a gamble, that is why I am here.  I'm ready to push my chips into the pot and see what happens.
