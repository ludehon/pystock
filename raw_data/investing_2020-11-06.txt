*Lack of higher return loans_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Why I plan on no longer buying ETFs in exchange for focusing solely on Bitcoin, Square, Tesla, Lemonade and Shopify When I first initially started investing I was bought into the index fund hype. But the longer I learn about investing the more I realize that index funds will let you become wealthy when you’re already old, and no longer have the time or energy to enjoy it. 

But it’s not enough to become wealthy or develop generational wealth in a short amount of time.

Furthermore I have realized the really successful investors, Warren Buffet, Bill Ackman, and Cathy Wood all have or had very concentrated portfolios. In only their top 5 best ideas. With Cathy Wood being forced to only hold 10% max for each company, due to the rules and regulations of owning an ETF. So instead of top 5 companies, it’s more like top 5 platforms (crypto, fintech, genomics, robotics, AI). 

But the point still stands a concentrated portfolio of buying and **holding** your top 5 conviction picks is probably the best bet you have for hitting it out of the park and beating index funds. Not day trading, options trading or managing 10-20+ different stocks.

&#x200B;

Furthermore we currently live in an era of disruptive innovation where the superior products that are being led or created by very intelligent people (Satoshi, Jack Dorsey, Elon Musk, Daniel Schreiber, Tobias Lutke), have only realized a fraction of their potential market share.  Bitcoin at a 200 bn market cap vs gold’s 10 trillion. Lemonade’s 3 billion market cap vs the average large insurance company’s 60 billion market cap, Square at 70 billion vs Chase/JP Morgan/Paypal at 200-300 billion each and so forth.  

&#x200B;

Worst case scenario is that this concentrated portfolio vastly underperforms index funds but at least I can retire with enough savings to live with dignity through my 401K contributions.  Best case, all 5 investments do well and I will become wealthy in less than 10 years._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ How to compare two stocks with Market Cap?

What does everyone think?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ A Case Against Maxing Your 401K Today I came across this article (written last week), by Nick Maggiulli, who is with Ritzholtz Wealth Management. He uses data to re-evaluate whether you should max your 401k or not.

[https://ofdollarsanddata.com/should-i-max-out-my-401k/](https://ofdollarsanddata.com/should-i-max-out-my-401k/) 

The conclusion that he comes to is that:  


>Regardless of whether you have a Roth 401(k) or a traditional 401(k), the benefits of contributing beyond the employer match are much smaller than you might have initially imagined... This is why it’s hard for me to support maxing out your 401(k) for an extra 0.34% per year.  That illiquidity premium is just too small to be worth it *even if* you don’t need the money for something like a down payment on a house.  And for those with a traditional 401(k), the benefits are likely to be even smaller given the current trend of U.S. deficit spending and likely future tax increases.

For me personally, I found this article and supporting data to confirm some of the thoughts that I've had regarding the illiquidity premium of having your money tied up for decades with the only early withdrawal option being to take a withdrawal penalty. 

When you compare that to a taxable account where you can either liquidate or access your money at near the fed fund rates (presently under \~1.59% w/ IBKR) with no set repayment schedule, no penalties, and without triggering a taxable event (short cash can be cleared by depositing money when you have more available), it really makes you think. In the case of accessing your money in an emergency without triggering a taxable event, the messaging is not to use margin recklessly, but barring a catastrophic event, 1.2x-1.3x (20%-30%) margin should not result in a maintenance call when invested across a body of non-leveraged equities or when diversified across an entity like the SPY; especially if you've been contributing to the account on a regular basis in lieu of extra contributions in your 401k (this continuously reduces your short cash position, bringing the aforementioned hypothetical 1.3x down every time you add cash to your account).  


The primary benefit of maxing out the 401k appears to be to combat investor *behavioral problems* rather than to provide some kind of mathematically improved future outcome. 

Yet, despite this, I still max my 401k out every year in addition to contributing to my taxable accounts. Maybe I'll change my mind in 2021.

The Japanese video game company shipped more than 6.5 million Switch consoles in the quarter with Animal Crossing being the best title with 14.27 million sold.  As of September, lifetime-to-date sales of the Switch consoles reached 68.3 million units worldwide.

Demand for the Switch reached a record high in the wake of stay-at-home orders due to the pandemic, which also caused Nintendo to run into supply issues with the console due to factory shutdowns in China. Those closures triggered component shortages and slowed output for factories in Vietnam where the Switch is manufactured. As of now, there is still a shortage of both versions of the Switch at major retailers around the globe.

I believe the company can transform into one that’s able to roll out incremental new platforms while retaining its user base. Hit products such as the Wii were often followed by much less successful ones, such as the disastrous Wii U. With each new console, Nintendo rolled the dice on making the new machine a success, and while it got things right this generation with the Switch, a successor console would have no guarantee of similar sales.

With every console generation, the install base resets to zero and their earnings power essentially resets to zero. Nintendo can break free by releasing a new and more powerful iteration of the Switch every few years. They can continuously have an install base of say 100 million consoles out there, that just moves along over time. Going forward I predict they will create 3 lines of devices that will reach a broad line of customers while maintaining the incremental updates. Switch Lite, Switch, and the upcoming Switch Pro.

That kind of perpetual platform model already exists: Apple Inc.’s iPhone. Like the smartphone, new versions of the Switch could be backwards-compatible with all games released so far while becoming more powerful and feature-rich. They have used Nvidia's arm chips to ensure their software (games) will always work with every Switch that comes out. That would keep customers locked into Nintendo’s entertainment ecosystem on top of its exclusive first-party titles while making profits and sales more predictable.

Also don't forget, Nintendo gets 5%-10% of revenue from everything that isn't Switch-related, depending on what quarter or year is being looked at. Nintendo management, traditionally secretive about future plans, has hinted that it wants to change its dependency on a single console going forward. Here are a few things we know are coming:

**Theme parks.** Nintendo is partnering with Universal to build Super Nintendo World parks in Japan, Florida, California, and Singapore. Like Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge at Disney parks, Super Nintendo World is meant to be a 100% immersive experience where visitors feel like they are in one of Nintendo's games. Construction started on the Japan park in 2017, and it is supposed to be open in 2021, depending on what happens with COVID-19. 

**Video entertainment.** With the rise of streaming budgets and modern animation technology, Nintendo has started partnering/licensing its IP for movie and TV production. A Super Mario Bros. film from the makers of Despicable Me is supposed to come out in 2022. It will be animated (as opposed to the trainwreck 1993 version) and focused on a family audience. A Legend of Zelda movie has been rumored to be coming to Netflix, although nothing material has been announced so far. Nintendo President Shuntaro Furukawa said in the future visual content may not be limited to just film, and that Nintendo's main goal is to invest in entertainment to attract new fans to its content. 

**Hybrid physical and digital games.** Movies and theme parks may be the largest opportunity for Nintendo, but investors shouldn't forget physical games and toys. For example, the company just released Mario Kart: Home Circuit, where users not only race cars and characters on a screen but also with a physical racing track.

In the end, we need to stop thinking of Nintendo as just a gaming company and more as an entertainment company._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ How calls and puts affected AMD yesterday Check this out, I found it super interesting.

2. It skips through all the calls/puts and goes to 83
3. All the calls and puts before 80 are cleared and not initiated.
4. A large call is placed with 6000 volume
5. Price continues to reject this larger order and stays around 83 markThat would make sense because  the market doesn't know what to do, hence the really low volume.
6. Before Market close, that call was increased.
7. Premarket accepts that Call

This is going to be a short post regarding two common investing mistakes, specifically Confirmation bias and Recency bias. Anyone is prone to falling victim to these, but by being more aware of them there is much less tendency to unknowingly let them guide our decisions.

# Confirmation Bias:

Simply put this is just ignoring relevant information that goes against our views, and seeking out info that just confirms what we want to believe. We've all seen the posts stating "This is going to happen to stock XYZ", they ignore any facts in the comments refuting their position, and yet, when the stock moves in the opposite direction there is surprise?

The best counter is to seek out information that challenges your conclusion, review the company's financials/profiles, read opinions that are opposed to your own, and be honest about your motivations. Are you just trying to make a quick trade? Or an investment?

# Recency Bais:

This is when emphasis is put onto recent events and giving less weight to those that have happened in the past. Recency bias makes us think more in the short term. For example, perhaps we come to the conclusion that the market will keep going up? Or down? Or say an investor buys a stock and it drops over 20% in a month, they might be more likely to view all the related investments as bad due to the recent experience. Perhaps a closer look at the balance sheet would have revealed it was the bad one from the bunch.

The point here isn’t to completely ignore recent data and trends. This is often what swing trading can be influenced by! The point is to ensure that your decision making isn't too heavily influenced by it, trends can often change dramatically. For several months tech stocks are on fire, and then the next few they underperform the rest of the market.

The tendency to think that the most recent strong performers are going to be tomorrow’s strong performers, will often leave you disappointed.

Whenever you hear "momentum" and "trend" always be cautious, do your research. Additionally think less in the short term, craft a long-term investment horizon with your specific investment goals in mind.

# Final Thoughts:

Everyone is unique in the way they think and go about their investment strategies, some may be more prone to some biases than others may be. It is important to remember that no one person is an expert, seek out opinions, and if you need more discipline then make yourself a rules-based checklist for investments. Prevent the FOMO.

There are a lot more biases that influence our thinking, reading up on them to be more aware how they can influence your decision making will make you a better investor in the future.

As always thankyou for reading, hopefully this short post got some brain juices going. If anyone has some strategies they use or another common bias they see people falling victim to then please comment. Have a good night everyone.

Tattooed Chef is a young plant based food company that became publicaly listed few mouths ago via SPAC. The company was established in 2018 and has been rapidly growing ever since. In the first half of 2019 they reported 33mil in sales, and  a 104% increase raised the revenue to 67 mil in the first half of 2020. Their investors presentation looks pretty promising (google "tattooed chef investor presentation" first link).

Two of the top 20 documentaries rn are about healthy diet and how vegan saves lifes (What the health and The game Changer (you have a couple more)), which is backed up by a lot of facts. So this will also encourage people to eat healthy. 
4. I read the reviews at walmart and their FB page and are nothing but good!! Only reason couple of people are complaining, is because it is expensive and corona won't have a major effect because most people who can afford their products on regular basis still have a job or are back to work. 
5. Their earning call is coming in on the 11.9, which in my oppinion will be pretty good.
6. Mark Cuban showed interest for TTCF in one of his tweets last week. 

Do your own DD and give me your oppinion. What is you target price in few years? 

From a techincal perspective I think that the trend is now turned upward and that 16.55 two days ago was the lowest.
I know that some articles might say that p/e is insane, but they are not taking in to account the growth and the trendiness of the stock


Good luck trading and have a good evening_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Why Do Income Stocks Do Poorly When Rates Fall? Hello fellow investors.. Why do income stocks do poorly in a decreasing interest rate environment while growth stocks pick up steam and soar? Does it have to do with the fact that the economy by virtue of rates falling is spiraling and so therefore income stocks will do as poorly as the economy?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Pros and cons of P&F charting as an investment strategy Just trying to drum up some discussion and learn a little more about point and figure charting when used for long term investments. I am meeting with an old friend tomorrow who has made partner at his wealth management firm and I’m sure at some point the conversation will turn to finances. From what I can glean from the investment philosophy portion of their site this is the primary strategy they employ. As a lawyer by trade a lot of what I read was way outside my wheelhouse but I would like to have what at least resembles an intelligent discussion with him before I commit any money._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Understanding an actively-managed ETF I invest in ARk etfs and signed up for the daily trades notification. It’s pretty interesting but trying to understand what they’re doing on a daily basis. If they are selling positions, what does that do to the fund itself? Just trying to understand how this works now that I’m seeing their daily activity._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ How to get over seeing a stock you nearly chose skyrocket? Hi

At the beginning of the pandemic I decided that I wanted to take a look into stocks and while I don't have alot of disposable income I did at the time have a few hundred pounds to play with. I decided instead to make a demo account and see how things go.

One of the stocks I bought on the demo account was NIO. At the time the stock was going for $2.40.

I remember at the time telling myself to get a few hundred shares and leave it but I didn't as I read too much about avoiding Chinese stock and over time as the price increased I've just sat back and watched it fly and my feeling of missing out grows stronger.

I don't have alot of money and do have bills to pay so how do you get over seeing a stock skyrocket that could have changed that?

I've told myself many times that I would have sold long before now and would be kicking myself for a different reason, probably when I saw the price double but it isn't much comfort to me currently._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_
