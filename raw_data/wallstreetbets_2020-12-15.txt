 TESLA on its way to the S&P 500 this week _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Been a slow, steady, conservative ride. Time to YOLO it. Millionaire or homeless... Suggestions? _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Avepoint - The Best Growth Opportunity in 2021 **What is Avepoint?**

AvePoint is the largest independent software vendor of SaaS solutions to migrate, manage and protect data in Microsoft 365. They are not just a Microsoft partner, they are **THE** Microsoft Partner. They have won the *MSFT Partner Of The Year* Award 5 times.

Founded in 2001 and still growing. They have adapted to all the changes seen in software and cloud computing flawlessly. Not many companies have the pliability to adapt to market and technological innovations over the course of 20 years. There aren‚Äôt too many 20-year-old technology companies around today, especially ones that are thriving and still innovating, outside of the giant household names.

Taken from their investor presentation: [Agility and Invention](https://i.imgur.com/ThCEay8.png)

> We have consistently developed first-to-market solutions ‚Äì from the days of DocAve CD-ROMs and being the first SharePoint migration vendor, to being one of the first vendors to move our solutions onto Microsoft Cloud as IaaS/PaaS and then SaaS provider, to our recent Policies and Insights SaaS product that is the first to identify, prioritize and enforce actions to prevent the exposure of sensitive information in Microsoft 365.

**Flawless Growth and Financials**

Here's the dopesauce. [There are 212 public software companies and AvePoint is one of 5 that is growing at a rate of more than 25% revenue while maintaining a higher than 10% EBIT margin.](https://i.imgur.com/QQYIpRj.png) The others in this group are ZM, RNG, NOW, TEAM. Take a quick look at the year these companies are having based on their growth and the stay at home environment. Avepoint fits this exact script.

They already have a mega client base of 7 million customers. **25% of the Fortune 500 companies use Avepoint.**

AvePoint‚Äôs 7 million customers represent a 3% share of Microsoft‚Äôs 250 million 365 users. AvePoint believes it can get to 10% share and Microsoft will hit 500 million users in the future, good for 50 million AvePoint future customers.

(TAM) Total Addressable Market: $33 billion by 2022.

They did a subscription based conversion back in 2014 and according to their CEO Dr. Tianyi (TJ) Jiang, 70% of their yearly revenue is already spoken for, leaving tremendous upside for growth. [**They're already at 30%(!!!) YoY growth this year and looking to repeat that number in 2021.**](https://youtu.be/xD33VLw9ZOI?t=140)
They have no debt. Cash positive with $250M in reserves. EBIT margins of 10% as mentioned. Rare qualities in the SaaS sector. The company is well over the Rule of 40 (The Rule of 40 states that, at scale, a company's revenue growth rate plus profitability margin should be equal to or greater than 40%.). Another rare quality. This company fucks. üöÄ

**Valuation**

Avepoint will go public through a reverse merger with Apex Technologies in Q1 of 2021. This deal values Avepoint at $2B. In my estimation with currently market climates and demand for growth investing, **Avepoint is massively undervalued.**

A few of wall street's favorite growth SaaS company valuations:

Fastly (FSLY) - $10.6B Market Cap and $200M Revenue

Cloudflare (NET) - $25B Market Cap and $287M Revenue

Slack (WORK) - $24B Market Cap and $400M Revenue

Datadog (DDOG) - $31B Market Cap and $368M Revenue

Now compare this to Avepoint with it's $2B Market Cap and $150M Revenue. There's a huge valuation discrepancy based solely on what wall street investors are willing to pay for growth companies in the tech and stay and home sector especially with COVID. Avepoint has the potential to be a **5-10 bagger.**

**TL;DR** Avepoint is massively undervalued and has the potential to be a 5-10 bagger over the next year should it meet standard growth tech valuations alone. This combined with it's boosted cash on the back of going public and its already flawless financials makes it the perfect company to pocket now!

They are waiting on approval from the FDA for their reduced nicotine content VLN cigarettes. 22nd Century believes that authorization of the company‚Äôs MRTP (modified risk tobacco) application is imminent, and it plans to launch VLN cigarettes within just 90 days of authorization. 

They have technology that controls the amount of nicotine in a cigarette. The FDA will soon require all cigarettes sold in the U.S. to have reduced nicotine minimally or to non addictive levels. 22nd Century is the leader in reduced nicotine content tobacco products. And, they are committed to license their technology so that every cigarette manufacturer in the U.S. to comply with the standard. 

This stock has soared over 300% in the last 3 months in anticipation of FDA approval. They will be the first and only company to have a reduced nicotine cigarette on the market. Once approved this company will start making billions. They think they will get approved by the end of this year.

The idea goes like this:

1. Find a stock or ETF **extremely sensitive** to events that will cause the stock/ETF **to either rocket up or crash down‚Äîthat you would like to own anyway, despite either direction** (such as TQQQ or anything similar that you can afford)
2. Run the Wheel Strategy to collect premium from that stock/ETF every week or every month.
3. Then use **some of that premium** to buy the **cheapest and most unlikely to happen LEAP calls and puts on the same stock/ETF** (because the stock/ETF is extremely sensitive to calls and puts of such unlikely events). **Keep in mind that you are buying both calls and puts.**
4. Continue using the Wheel Strategy until that unknown extreme event happens.
5. Profit from either the LEAP calls or puts from that unknown extreme event that happens or will happen.
6. Rinse and Repeat

# Critique that idea.

# Some Questions You May Have, and Answers

* *Why use stocks/ETFs that are extremely sensitive to unlikely events that will cause it to rocket up or crash down?*
   * My answer: It's through these unlikely events that massive returns are possible. And the more sensitive it is, the more rapid the returns. But keep in mind that these returns are unlikely because you are betting on an unlikely event.
* *If such events are unlikely, why bet on them?*
   * My answer: it's called asymmetric betting. The upside is literally unlimited, and the downside is whatever the cheapest LEAP calls and puts you paid for it.
* Why not just by FDs? Stonks only go up bitchass pussy.
   * My answer: my current win-rate with FDs is 0.
* *Aren't I just losing profits, premium, and capital if these unlikely events don't happen?*
   * My answer: technically, yes you are losing some money. But if you don't bet for these unlikely events to happen, then you lose the chance for massive returns.

Any other more questions, I probably have an answer or not.

QDEL sits on a moneyprinter, and you can be positive it will go brrrrrr.

Fundamentals:

In October the FDA's EUA of their Sofia Test ([https://www.quidel.com/immunoassays/rapid-sars-tests/sofia-sars-antigen-fia](https://www.quidel.com/immunoassays/rapid-sars-tests/sofia-sars-antigen-fia)) launched QDEL to the heights of $285. It's currently sitting at $200! This Stock has serious range and a massive gap to fill at $270 for good measure! EUA for the home kit will launch it past that and imho beyond ATH.

Technicals: The stock just pulled back to a short-term support range at 195 -199 following a $25 rally after a tap of the 200 DMA. You couldn't wish for a better entry. PT 275 by EoY.

*Barron's article:*  

Bed Bath & Beyond is rising early Tuesday, a day after it announced it would sell Cost Plus World Market, its last non-core brand.     

Bed Bath & Beyond (ticker: BBBY) said that private-equity firm Kingswood        Capital Management was buying the store chain for an undisclosed        amount; the deal is expected to close before Bed Bath's fiscal year ends        in February. In addition, Bed Bath announced a new $150 million        accelerated share repurchase program. It will be added to the $225        million buyback plan launched in October, which it has largely        funded from noncore asset sales.     

The shares closed down in regular trading Monday, but are up 1.9% to $19.23        at recent check. Bed Bath has gained more than 9% year to date, rising        nearly six-fold from its lows in March.     

Analysts were largely happy with the news. Raymond James's Bobby        Griffin reiterated a Strong Buy rating and $26        price target on the shares. He writes that the sale dovetails well with        management's strategy to focus on its flagship brands, and calls        concerns that the lack of disclosure about the price is " shortsighted,"        given its strong balance sheet. "Accordingly, at this point, the        monetization of Cost Plus is not needed as a core part of the investment        thesis and is just extra capital for an incremental accelerated share        repurchase plan," he says.     

Robert W. Baird's Peter Benedict reiterated an        Outperform rating and $50 price target, writing that        following the sale, Bed Bath's "portfolio restructuring \[is\] seemingly        complete." He notes that some investors might have been disappointed        that the release didn't include any update for the third quarter, but        overall it was good news: "With a streamlined portfolio of assets and        strong balance sheet, Bed Bath has the focus and financial flexibility        to drive its business transformation over the next few years."     

Telsey Advisory Group's Joseph Feldman reiterated        an Outperform rating and $28 price target. He says the        sale will allow Bed Bath to focus on its four key categories: home,        beauty, wellness, and baby. "Looking ahead, the planned initiatives --        which target merchandising, pricing, stores, supply chain, digital, and        technology -- should result in a smaller, but more profitable Bed        Bath & Beyond by 2023."

\- Recently acquired eIQ, an EV electrification company that determines how and when to pivot to electric vehicles for fleets

\- Helps lower emissions of natural gas companies by converting them and making them more efficient

\- Largest solar and wind farms in the world

\- Low IV premium cmpared to other solar stocks on the market  


\- Consistent growth in revenue and EPS 

This stock is a steady utilities company, but is best prepared to benefit from the Green Plan. Leaps 2 years out are only 2-3$ and shares are extremely low risk.

I also told you to get the hell out of the 12/11-12/18 options as those would expire worthless.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k98p6h/pltr\_technical\_analysis\_from\_a\_professional/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k98p6h/pltr_technical_analysis_from_a_professional/)

now I will go over how to trade the stock in the next couple of weeks. I am cutting down the number of words I am writing because it has come to my attention from comments in my previous posts that a lot of you guys can't read. So I am going to keep it even more basic.

We are now approaching where TSLA and NIO were after their first initial rally, correction and consolidation before the second leg rally which then forms the symmetrical triangle.

https://preview.redd.it/yzim1gl5ke561.png?width=629&format=png&auto=webp&s=2e35a306b95241794ff00e6c69b14e6285bae886

Again, this was the same chart for Tesla for the first phase of the run-up and transition to the second run-up. The slight skew of the triangle doesn't matter, what matters is you see a narrowing of the band before the upward movement.

https://preview.redd.it/obkgayjake561.png?width=629&format=png&auto=webp&s=71c53d79f93f758ee43d8b46c61646088f1f7293

Now we look at option pricing. Option deltas  are the most attractive that I have seen on PLTR for almost 1+ month now. These tell me that there are very few buyers of call options at this point and we are in a lull before periods of significant more option buying.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/v2btc0pyje561.png?width=701&format=png&auto=webp&s=4e01729545a596866a3b062935bee7d25f6ebe41

We are about to start the explosive second run phase of Palantir and my target still mid to low 40s by end of the year/early next year.  Again, don't be surprised if we still dip down to around 23. But the downside is largely done. This is of course assuming we don't get a massive stock market crash for which I have small amounts of hedges on VIX calls that are rolling on a monthly basis.

https://preview.redd.it/1orczd5xje561.png?width=629&format=png&auto=webp&s=ef76cf4df7324f0779a1949f980dd78d29f2f150

TLR: go long PLTR now, risk reward is quite favorable. 23 is the lowest it can probably go in the short term. You are already seeing doubters on PLTR on WSB. This means from a psychological stand-point, most would be sellers are already gone. The market is now open widely to incremental buyers. I bought some 12/24 calls at the 30 strike and added more to my 5/21 50 strike.

Mar 19 2021 15 Put_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ WSBippin and the PLTR _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ I have created a WSB cartoon and I need some opinions here. Hi fellow tards,

I‚Äôm an animator in Los Angeles and currently unemployed because of Covid. I‚Äôve been apart of this community for two months and it‚Äôs easily better than any discord. 

I‚Äôve gotten down all the lingo and all the insider jokes about this sub and you guys have me cracking up laughing everyday. 

The cartoon is a comedy that I plan to upload every Monday and Friday. I‚Äôve decided to include some moments where the main protagonist is looking at his phone and notices certain comments (real comments) from the sub. Should I block the names out? Or would people appreciate seeing their comment on a cartoon? Serious question. 

Hero‚Äôs and villains = Cramer, citron, heidenburgh, Stan the trading man, YATES, ‚Äúinvesting‚Äù sub Reddit members, etc. I need more suggestions for this insane comedy. 
 
Any suggestions I‚Äôd love to hear them. 

Let‚Äôs go DUB SB!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ I've been seeing alot of posts about this being the "top" or "peak" of WSB because of boomer cucks talking about us. Shut up Don't fall into the trap that has brought down great communities before. Just because these fucking boomer cucks want to use up their denture paste talking about us doesn't mean they can survive against our totally not market manipulation ploys as well as pump and dump schemes they see their wives doing with the fitness trainer they're seeing every Saturday. Don't get into the mindset that this is the "peak" or this is the "top."

This is definitely not the peak. This community has more than enough saved up cum (because our girlfriends and wives are banging good traders) to hold the damn line and push those dusty ass gremlins out from destroying our safe haven of retards and autists. This is the greatest sub on here and I'd have a hole in my gay ass heart that isn't going to be filled by circle jerking failed abortions lurking on other subs. I'd rather watch Fox News than have some argument over which hentai pillow fucks best from some fetal alcohol syndrome runt on r/all. 

Wake the fuck up, retards. We got a market to burn... Into the stratosphere. üöÄ

Values with N/A means ticker doesnt exist (in case of SPACs, ticker changes) and/or the date hasn't come yet so cannot fetch the value (ie, IPO lockup expires 1/1/2021, so obviously we can't get the stock value of future date).

Pretty self explainatory, but..

Column B is current price

Column H is price 7 days before IPO lockup expiry

Column J is price 1 day after IPO lockup expiry

Column K is price movement between H-J. If it shows -100%, it means the value was not found yet because it's in the future. 

Column L is price ratio of IPO acquired price to current price. Ie, IPO acquired shares at $10 and current price $20, will give you 2.0. The higher ratio the better **theoretical** success of shorting the stock, as insiders want to get out with profit. 

**This doesnt mean all in every single stock with 2.0 or higher ratio.** But if you see anything interesting it might be worth buying some puts before the IPO share lockup expiration. You can see ''statistically'' the higher the ratio, the higher drop the day after expiry...usually...generally.

DraftKings is on the bill for legalization in NY and could be passed soon, potentially by the end of the year [if politicians aren't cucks for once.](https://www.barrons.com/articles/new-york-could-allow-statewide-mobile-betting-what-that-means-for-draftkings-stock-51607621746). As states are desperate for revenue look for more and more of them to legalize sports betting, and DKNG is the market leader with projections of close to 50% market share in 2021. 

Disney says that sports wagering is a "key opportunity" and "important area of growth for the company". Guess who owns about 6% of DKNG? DIS. [ESPN + DKNG ='s many autists](https://www.casino.org/news/disney-says-sports-betting-can-boost-espn-streaming-service/).

It's been hovering around 50 for a couple of weeks now and looks like it's ready to breakout again and hopefully retest the ATH of around 64.

TL;DR  - politicians suck, dis owns 6%, people are betting on sports_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Is any of this good news going to ACTUALLY raise BlackBerrys stock price after 2-5 years of stagnation? A lot of people are hyping up BB, again, which has been an ongoing thing since 2018, and if we are being honest, the last 5 years, as BB has had constant streams of good news or "announcements" and had generally stayed along the $5-$9 route the last 5 years outside of a jump to 11-12 in mid-2018 which it crashed from and never returned.

I'm seriously curious, especially if anyone can provide evidence, why all of a sudden NOW it will be different and BB, which is now a software only company with limited reach, not even licensing the brand for phones anymore, is somehow going to finally break trend and maybe hit $20+ in stock price.

These announcements the last few weeks have not given BB a ton of money, hasn't increased their market cap, hasn't shown long-term viability, nothing has happened. BB would have to have an earnings surprise 20x times the expected to even have a shot at being viable.

I've analyzed and dug deep into all the news for BB and nothing here is showing anything that will lead to a growth in stock price. Maybe if lucky it will hit $10 again like mid 2018 before crashing back down to $5-$6.

Unless there's some crucial element I'm missing I'm assuming most users hyping up BB stock are long term bag holders nearing expiration on leaps or yearly options, or those who haven't made any money on stocks for 2-5 years._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ üöÄPresenting $30k to $1M the Unreleased CoronaVirus Vaccine You‚Äôll Want To TakeüöÄ **TL;DR ‚Äî Found unannounced FDA news about British Tobacco that might be a game-changer.**

Gentlemen, fuck MRNA, fuck moderna, fuck Pfizer, you don‚Äôt want to put that shit in your body unless you‚Äôre desperate and old and have no choice. Nobody knows the long term effects and don‚Äôt let them tell you otherwise.  

  

You know what you do want to put in your body? Fucking plants, natural shit that your body knows how to work with. Wanna know a secret? The company that made ZMAPP the only known cure that works for Fucking Ebola is called Kentucky Bioprocessing. Nobody really knows who the fuck they are.... but I do!  

  

You want to know who owns them? Fucking British American Tobacco ($BTI) company, that‚Äôs fucking right the same goddamn company that makes Lucky Strikes and Pallmall. They own a biotech company, not just any biotech company but the one that cured Ebola.  Here‚Äôs their patent on that:

They made MAJOR breaking news back in April that they were working on a coronavirus vax that uses tobacco plants (Nicotiana benthamiana) to build antibodies but more importantly make 100% sure your immune system doesn‚Äôt attack itself with the dreaded Cytokine storm.

A Spanish newsreport reported today that "Societe Generale" a big French bank was "SEDUCED" by "$MT" because their books look better than ever. They're predicting great profits next quarter due to surge in steel price/demand which has lead "Societe Generale" to upgrade $MT rating to a BUY with a target of $39.5. That's almost a 100% increase from now. This bank is one of the big boys and it's recognising the gains that will come to fruition.

If you want to read it yoursef just Google "Societe Generale arcelormittal" and a ton of reports will come up.

First off, CEO and meme-god Alex Karp holds the opposite views of Thiel (which google easily confirms). More importantly, it only confirms that the general public has no idea what PLTR truly does or how powerful the software is. **So today, I am going to take you all on an adventure and get you as close to the super scary stuff PLTR does so you can get a taste of their work. TL;DR at the bottom just make sure you look at the pictures.**

The images you are about to see come from a private think tank type business in DC that uses PLTR for their analysis of questionable activities around the globe. I linked the full reports and pulled out the best images. This data is all Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) from a variety of sources that PLTR turned from disparate data to powerful graphic with a story. The data itself comes from different countries databases including shipping registries, business registrations, transaction data, and many other country level sources. On its own, the data is useless, however, with PLTR you get complex network analysis that gives you answers to questions you didn't ask yet.

One separate thought, PLTR has been actively making the shift to a SaaS company for years. PLTR has been outsourcing the low margin government contract work (help desks, IT support, FSRs, and other functions). They have [preferred partners](https://www.palantir.com/partnerships/preferred-partners/) who do all the difficult inside of government work so PLTR can focus on being a SaaS company not a consulting company.

**Conclusion:** All of the information in those reports came from OSINT, imagine what the real version the USG uses can do. Adapt that power to the private sector and how PLTR could be used to harness data and make companies more efficient and profitable. This is basically the SkyNet prototype

**TL;DR: Former PLTR user believes PLTR's tech is still massively misunderstood and will go to the Moon. At least go back and look at the pictures if you don't like words. As WSB turns bearish on PLTR, you know its time to buy more.**

They own a portfolio of companies that sell gun, hunting, fishing and camping ACCESSORIES (see below links). Earnings was supposed to be the 23rd but was moved up to after-hours today, 12/15. If you are a hunter like me, then you probably know that everyone and their mom got out this year and finding gear was much tougher than normal. My thesis:

THE FLOAT OF THIS STOCK IS ONLY 12.97 MILLION. And it is 80% institution-owned. With good news i.e. blowout earnings and some solid volume, this price could gap up and rise very quickly.

EVERY BRAND IN THIS SECTOR HAS CRUSHED EARNINGS ESTIMATES LATELY. The best comparison in my opinion is Johnson Outdoorswhich reported ER last Friday and risen more than 30% since. Sportsman Warehouse crushed ER. Dick's Sporting Goods crushed ER. Big 5 sporting goods crushed ER. All three of these sell their products.

INSIDER BUYS over last few months in the mid $13 range. And they were big dick buys too

LAST EARNINGS - Non-GAAP EPS of $0.36 beats by $0.56; GAAP EPS of $0.13 beats by $0.34. Revenue of $50.47M (+51.9% Y/Y) beats by $9.4M. E-commerce net sales grew 130%, while traditional channel net sales rose 15%. Shares +6.3%. And since a large part of their portfolio is hunting related, they should post even stronger numbers since fall is hunting season.

TRADING BELOW BOOK VALUE. According to Webull BVPS is $16.14. 

STRONG TECHNICALS. Major Support at 13.23. Bullish breakout of descending wedge. RSI about to break above the 50mark. Stock has had highs >$19 and consolidated in the $14-16 range all throughout November.

RECORD GUN SALES THIS FALL. Data released on October 31st and beat the previous year's checks by nearly a million. This November beat last year by nearly 1.1 million. 

 RISKS: I mentioned earlier all these outdoor retail brand companies crushed their Q3 numbers, but many of them sold the news. Sportsman Warehouse for example has been getting crushed after an initial ER spike. However, all of these went on MAJOR runs from April to now. I think there is a chance that this could follow the trend even with great numbers. With less staycations and socially distanced outdoor activities in the future, growth projections and forecasts will probably slow down.

But, if anyone was looking for an entry, this is a good point.  If there is short covering, and I think there's been a very healthy amount for 4 trading days straight (short to total volume hovering between 25-31%, which is very low), they are running out of shares to cover with, and there is still a massive amount of short interest (I put the total 4 day decline in SI at roughly 15%, if I were to guess, using back-of-the-envelope math).

Volume today is low.  They will have to start going higher to find shares to bring in.

Paper hands have largely all sold now.  Look for this to return to $14 in the short to medium term, as shorts will need to move higher to find new sellers.

Does Apple have room to grow again? DASH & ABNB are fading after crazy IPOs. Let‚Äôs talk about this and the latest stock market news**

**\~Very Long Post\~**

Hello everyone and Good morning! So, let‚Äôs start with the recap of Monday, as we saw a great start in the early morning with the Dow hitting an intra-day record, but the rally faded for the broader stock market and especially the industrial heavy [DOW JONES](https://ibb.co/yVcZV95) which lost .61%, with the broad market [SP500](https://ibb.co/xGBkgyF) also losing .44% while the tech heavy [NASDAQ](https://ibb.co/dWNjyCY) lived up to the recent reputation as a go-to defensive play yesterday and finished up .50%. Meanwhile the [VIX](https://ibb.co/mH5Pmsw) also spiked more than 6% and is nearing the 25 levels, which could mean significantly more volatility for the stock market.

We also saw more companies declining [yesterday](https://ibb.co/jwVnsXt) on normal volume of about 10.5B shares, as we finally went below 80% of the companies trading above the 50-day simple moving average, as small-cap growth companies outperformed [yesterday](https://ibb.co/NNWkSQt) with large-cap value companies lagging, especially from the energy and industrial sectors. With energy losing more 3.5% for the day, while the only 2 gaining [sectors](https://ibb.co/0ymGMHL) were Technology and Consumer Discretionary, which seems to indicate what I was expecting, that investors are dropping losers from this year for tax purposes and betting again on the companies that sparked the rally since the bottom in March. And keep in mind that funds & money managers use this tactic for window dressing also, so that they can have a nice advertising brochure for next year.

Here is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/kMTNKY7) from yesterday, you can see here the big wall of red in the energy sector, with Disney which saw a healthy correction after a huge run and Pfizer being some of the biggest losers. While Netflix, Amazon, Nvidia, Tesla and PayPal were some of the biggest gainers alongside the biotech sector.

[HERE](https://ibb.co/tPnzGmN) is the economic data that will be received today, there isn‚Äôt anything big on the calendar, as we get ready for a lot of big numbers coming on Wednesday and Thursday. Just a reminder, there was no big economic data that came in yesterday.

So, Quadruple witching day is just a couple of days away, and this time it will probably bring even more heavy trading volume than usual.

For anyone that doesn‚Äôt know, quadruple witching [refers](https://ibb.co/p063Sgw) to the day when stock options, stock index futures & options and single stock futures expire on the same day. 

This happens 4 times every single year, and usually brings increased [volume](https://ibb.co/Gxr4pnc) to the stock markets, and guess what guys, this will coincide with the last day of trading before Tesla enters the SP index.

So I believe this next week and especially the 17th-22nd will be very volatile for Tesla. 

At the [moment](https://ibb.co/SRTyzcN) there is more open interest in tesla stock options, with over 8 million contracts, which multiplied by 100 shares for each contract represent 800M shares, that is more than the actual free float for the stock at the moment at 760M shares.

And, right now, there are a lot more put options contract on Tesla, with a put to call ratio of 1.5

My personal opinion is that we can see the stock continue to rise in the following days before going for a dip or correction following this huge moment of volatility for the stock. We can see the avg [volume](https://ibb.co/qYNg2dL) for Tesla has been near 60M shares in the last 10days, so there have been a lot of shares that have already exchanged hands. I believe most of the money managers, who are not obliged to perfectly track the SP indexes, have already finished up buying the stock, so I expect there will be a lot more sellers than buyers when most retail investors expect the stock to go even higher. But don‚Äôt take my advice, do your own research and analysis. Full disclosure, I am a bull long-term on Tesla, but just think there is a downside risk approaching.

So let go through a couple of stock market news, [Apple](https://ibb.co/NVQsB0b) is planning on manufacturing almost 100M new iPhone in the first half of 2021, that would be an increase of almost 30%, as they are planning make more than 230M iPhones in 2021 (including new & old models). This is great news for the stock as Apple has been pretty much flat after the September pullback, and might finally get some momentum back when they announce sales for the iPhone in the next quarters.

This might also be helped by the fact that US [consumers](https://ibb.co/f2Tfhpj) are expecting to spend more next year, even if they expect to have a pretty much flat income and earnings growth. This is an improving view of the consumers as they were expecting to spend less in the last survey from October.

Meanwhile, as I expected [AirBnB](https://ibb.co/xSdVJrG) and [Doordash](https://ibb.co/wLfyvFG) have started to fade after that crazy IPO frenzy. [Doordash](https://ibb.co/tmyyWnW) fell more than 8% yesterday and is down again pre-market while [AirBnB](https://ibb.co/GnRxn3b) is also down almost 10% since last week. And with downgrades from analysts already starting to appear, this companies have small to no room for error at this valuation. Especially with Doordash which has received a significant boost in the last year, growth will be more difficult in the future and won‚Äôt justify this price point.

We have also seen [Snowflake](https://ibb.co/J5j6DsP) come back to earth, dropping more than 15% in the last 5 trading days, as the first share lockup period expiration is today. This will allow current and former employees to sell 25% of their stock options, currently representing 1,3M shares. With Non-employee shareholders also able to sell up to 25% of shares, those shares stand at 38M right now, with the rest of the shares being unlocked after they release their second quarterly earnings report in March, 

We also got [numbers](https://ibb.co/8srNcwj) from New Jersey, as gambling keeps expanding even if sports are not back to normal. This is great news for companies like DraftKings. While others like Wynn will [benefit](https://ibb.co/zHL4Gvw) a lot from more tourism both in the US and in Macau.

And just keep an eye on [Shopify](https://ibb.co/nMHptKW), as the company seems to be in the eye of the tiger, with Amazon looking into ways of entering that market also.

So, guys, I still think there are a lot of positive catalysts for the markets, especially with a stimulus apparently very close, the European Central Bank [agreed](https://ibb.co/xqWDmZs) last week on a new stimulus for the Eurozone, as they keep printing money. And with interest rates probably remaining incredibly low after this week FED meeting, money will remain very cheap at the moment. So yeah, with the Pfizer vaccine yesterday, Moderna probably next week, and JNJ to follow in early 2021, I think we are poised for a good 2021 in the stock market. Especially with little political volatility after the Georgia run-off in early January as the US electoral College also formally [confirmed](https://ibb.co/pvjc9nf) Biden as the next President of the US yesterday.

Let‚Äôs hope for a great day in the market as the [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/vjT9ghr) seem to be pointing at a good open, hopefully some green action continues after that.

&#x200B;

Alright I don't need to explain this to you because I already know you stopped reading and/or can't read, but I'll leave it here:

(1) SNOW is going to fall because of valuation compression

Seven months ago in private, series G funding SNOW had a valuation of $12.4B. Now, it's market capitalization is $93.2B. That's 750% of it's value in February OF THIS YEAR. You don't care. Fine. SNOW's TTM gross profit. What? Yeah I'll explain. TTM is trailing twelve months, and gross profit is what they sold their shit for minus how much it cost to make the shit. TTM gross profit is about $300M.   How much shit they sell (revenue) and how much it costs to make the shit (cost of revenue) grow together at about the same rate. So gross profit is the number we care about. This isn't even factoring is how much it costs to SELL the actual shit (operating expense). Shit-SELLING costs don't scale as much as shit-MAKING costs (FYI, this quarter shit-selling cost $750M so the company lost about $450M). They are increasingly selling more shit. More people want their shit. In fact, in a year, they sold \~120% more shit. You might think Frank "Coochie Man" Slootman is gunna take this baby to the moon, but that'll happen in late March and April. Let's assume that SNOW delivers godlike revenue numbers. Grows 100% year over year (hard to sustain as numbers get larger). Let's also assume shit-making cost growth at 100% and they're VERY VERY efficient so shit-selling grows less 50% (size efficiencies). Pretty sure these are impossible numbers. Okay.. so next year gross profit (shit sold minus shit-making cost) is $600M, and $1.125B. Loss of $525M. 2 years: gross profit $1.2B and cost $1.6875B. Loss of $487.5M. 3 years: gross profit $2.4B and cost $2.53125B for a loss of $131.25M. In this ABSURD model (in which they don't pay any interest on debt), they lose over a billion in 12 quarters before becoming profitable in the 13th quarter from now. That doesn't even factor in the fact that costs came in far above analyst expectations this quarter, so it's likely they can't suppress cost growth. But who cares about the valuation? NO ONE. NOT WARMAN BUFFLORD.

(2) In the short term, SNOW will fall because of lockup expiry.

Ik you guys know this already but I dug into the details. I'm talking SEC S1 IPO registration, I'm talking alternative minimum tax structure, I'm talking public float breakdown. So, first of all. Lockup expiry #1 is today. Employees and former employees under the title of VP can sell 25% of holdings. Will they? Almost definitely yes. This lockup is tiny and represents about 1.3M shares. The total public float is around 30M shares. But average volume is around 8M so we can guarantee that today about 1.3M of that 8M will be selling pressure. Why will they definitely sell? If they wait past December 31st of this year, they get locked into the alternative minimum tax, wherein the difference between market and strike of their options is treated as income and taxed as such at 26 or 28%. It's much cheaper to sell shares at the long-term capital gains rate for their tax bracket (employees under VP probably get like 20% cuz they make in between 150K and 200K a year in income). But WAIT-- won't they get SHORT-term capital gains rate? No. The vast majority of employees and non-employees have option incentive packages (ISOs) and restricted stock units (RSUs) from the inception of the company in 2012. It's cheaper tax-wise to exercise options as soon as they vest, and the vesting (waiting) period is typically 2 years. So everyone has been exercising their options and turning them into shares. These shares if they're more than 1 year since exercise are long term capital gains. So any ISOs given to employees before 2017 are guaranteed to be exercised and long-term classified. The S1 filing itself says that as of July 31st 2020, 25% of the holdings of employees and former employees were stock (NOT options). So it's very likely that stock has been held over a year and is ready to be sold. BUT THAT'S ONLY THE START. Next if the share price stays over 133% of IPO ($160), which it will, for 10 trading days of 15 trading days following December 15th, Venture Capitalists can sell 25% of holdings. This represents an S-load more shares than the pesky employees, and the VC have the huge incentive to sell and lock in the high price of snow on their 25% before the general selloff that will result from the god-tier lockup expiry in late Feb/early March. Two trading days after SNOW files their form 10K with the SEC for annual results, the rest of all shares will be available to sell. That will boost public float from 30M to 300M. YIKES. This imminent selling pressure will (a) drive the price down more after the 10K, but also (b) it provides the massive incentive for VC and employees to sell their 25% stakes that are unlocked earlier (today and in early January).

All in all, SNOW will see continued pressure through mid January. The only hope for a small rally is between mid-January and mid-February (after first two mini-lockup expiries but before the god-tier expiry). But after that the selloff in anticipation of total lockup expiry will take over. These lockups will drop price because it's not like SNOW is undervalued rn. It's financial valuation is massively overweight, so there's cheap-buying justification for people to pick up shares and create public demand. There will only be selling pressure.

Full disclosure, I have about $4K of SNOW puts. I'd be stupid not to, it's almost too easy to kick back this winter and watch the snow fall._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Daily Discussion Thread for December 15, 2020 Your daily trading discussion thread. Please keep the shitposting to a minimum.

TLDR:  TIM APPLE WILL DELIVER US

TAIPEI -- Apple plans to produce up to 96 million iPhones for the first half of 2021, a nearly 30% year-on-year increase, after demand for its first-ever 5G handsets surged amid the pandemic, Nikkei Asia learned.

The Cupertino-based tech giant has asked suppliers to build some 95 million to 96 million iPhones, including the latest iPhone 12 range and the older iPhone 11 and iPhone SE, multiple people familiar with the matter told Nikkei Asia -- though [industrywide shortages](https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Technology/Booming-demand-for-PCs-and-phones-squeezes-tech-supply-chain) of key components could threaten that target.

The tentative full-year forecast that Apple shared with its suppliers suggests it plans to build up to 230 million iPhones in 2021, including both old and new models, the people said. This would mark a 20% rise from 2019, though the target will be regularly reviewed and revised in response to any changes in consumer demand, they added.

"The planned production for the next quarter and the following quarter have been decided and the outlook is quite bright," an executive at a key Apple supplier told Nikkei. "The iPhone 12 Pro, and iPhone 12 Pro Max are especially stronger than we estimated, while the demand for iPhone 12 is in line with the forecast, but iPhone 12 mini is a bit sluggish," the person added.

Apple logged two consecutive years of smartphone shipment declines in 2018 and 2019. In the first nine months of this year, its shipments stood at around 116 million iPhones, down just 1% on the year, according to data from research company IDC.¬†

Much of that improvement came from the iPhone 12 range -- Apple's answer to the 5G smartphone offerings of Samsung Electronics and Huawei Technologies -- which has enjoyed strong demand since hitting store shelves this quarter. The tentative production plan for 2021 is nearly on par with the record 231.5 million iPhones shipped in 2015.¬† ¬†_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Did you see this notice that just went out tonight from robinhood that starting Jan 11, they will no longer supper REITs, a bunch of the Chinese stocks affected by the governmental policies, and some other securities? _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ The only APP you‚Äôll ever need. _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ What PLTR does _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ The bearish angle from a bulls perspective Edit: Whoops this is about GME.

Someone tell me everything is going to be okay and that I won't be living in my mom's basement again._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ SWI Puts - Warm yourself at the garbage fire SWI - Solarwinds was compromised by a group of russian hackers. The stock fell **16.69%** today.  I reckon this is just the start.

**UPDATED INFO:  CISA ISSUES EMERGENCY DIRECTIVE TO MITIGATE THE COMPROMISE OF SOLARWINDS ORION NETWORK MANAGEMENT PRODUCTS** 

[https://www.cisa.gov/news/2020/12/13/cisa-issues-emergency-directive-mitigate-compromise-solarwinds-orion-network](https://www.cisa.gov/news/2020/12/13/cisa-issues-emergency-directive-mitigate-compromise-solarwinds-orion-network)

 **Emergency Directive 21-01** 

[https://cyber.dhs.gov/ed/21-01/](https://cyber.dhs.gov/ed/21-01/)

*Someone asked me to provide a simple description of what this SolarWinds hack is all about. So for anyone who is confused by the technical details, here's a thread with a simplified explanation of what happened and what it means.*

*The maker of software that is used in the highest echelons of gov, including the White House and NSA, was compromised by attackers who slipped malicious code into the software maker's trusted code without the software maker knowing it. The code got distributed to its customers*

*That malicious code, once it infected customer systems, opened a backdoor into those systems and contacted the hackers to let them know the door was open for them to surreptitiously enter those systems and begin stealing sensitive data on those networks.*

*The hackers did this back in March and their activity was only recently discovered - this means they have been inside gov systems all these months stealing data and spying on gov workers without anyone knowing until now. They also infected telecoms and other company networks.*

*Here is a list of some of the customers who use the software made by the software maker  (their name  is SolarWinds). All of these were potentially compromised.*

*SolarWinds has hundreds of thousands of clients in all; it said in a Securities and Exchange Commission disclosure on Monday that as many as 18,000 of them were potentially vulnerable to the attack.*

*Both* [*FireEye*](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2020/12/evasive-attacker-leverages-solarwinds-supply-chain-compromises-with-sunburst-backdoor.html) *and* [*Microsoft*](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2020/12/13/customers-protect-nation-state-cyberattacks/) *detailed the flow of the attack. First the hackers compromised SolarWinds' Orion update mechanism so that its systems could distribute tainted software to thousands of organizations. The attackers could then use manipulated Orion software as a backdoor into victims' networks. From there, they could fan out within target systems, often by stealing administrative access tokens. Finally, with the keys to the kingdom‚Äîor large portions of each kingdom‚Äîthe hackers were free to conduct reconnaissance and exfiltrate data.*

*This sort of so-called supply chain attack can have dire consequences. By compromising one entity or manufacturer, hackers can undermine target security efficiently and at scale.*

**If you're still reading this bullshit italics then congrats autronaut. This is where it actually gets interesting.**

*The extent of the damage is also difficult to get a handle on because Orion is itself a monitoring tool, setting up a bit of a "who watches the watchers" issue. For that same reason, systems also grant Orion trust and privileges on user networks that have value for attackers. Victims and potential targets must consider the possibility that these attacks* [*also compromised*](https://twitter.com/mubix/status/1338502543635329028) *much of their other infrastructure and authentication mechanisms using Orion's pervasive access. The extent of the exposure at US government agencies is still unknown; the revelation that DHS was impacted as well didn't come until Monday afternoon.*

**I'm just a humble lurker but this sounds like we haven't even seen the tip of the long dicking that SWI received.**

*The White House National Security Council, which reportedly held an emergency meeting on Saturday, said via spokesperson John Ullyot on Monday that it is collaborating with CISA, the FBI, and the intelligence community to respond with "a swift and effective whole-of-government recovery."*

P.S. fuck shitron üöÄüöÄ_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ PLTR Daily Technical Analysis - Still BullishüöÄ _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Vaccines are old news, DISTRIBUTION IS WHERE ALL THE MONEY IS GOING üöÄ üöÄ What's up retards,

&#x200B;

Fellow autist here doing my part to educate the masses. Don't you wish you got $MRNA calls when that shit was trading at like $80? Fear not my fellow autists, now that a vaccine has been approved, the next step is TRANSPORTING IT! This fucking Pfeizer vaccine needs to be kept at a whopping -70 celsius (-94F), and they can't just put some ice in a box and ship that shit out. Low and behold, now these fuckers need to find a way to transports hundreds of thousands of vaccines that need to be kept cold as shit. What do they do? Find companies that make high-performance freezers. I've looked for a few smaller companies that seem capable of the job, but Middleby Corp appears to be the biggest player in the game. I read another post about this by u/SnortTheBanks , pretty brief (which I'm sure you retards love) but I dug a little deeper.

&#x200B;

Middleby ($MIDD)  makes the freezers that will be used to transport the vaccine in the temperatures it needs to be kept at. THIS COMPANY WILL PIONEER THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE VACCINE. The US has not announced anything specifically related to $MIDD yet, but you can read this if you don't believe the demand for these freezers: [https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/12/02/pfizer-coronavirus-vaccine-freezers-desmon/?arc404=true](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/12/02/pfizer-coronavirus-vaccine-freezers-desmon/?arc404=true)

&#x200B;

Get in this shit before news gets out.

&#x200B;

All the smart people invested in creating a vaccine. Now that we have one, the money is going into transporting it. Premiums are dirt cheap but they won't be for long. This is the calm before the storm.

POSITIONS: if you don't like options just buy shares, personally I'm strapped with $MIDD 165c 1/15/21

&#x200B;

TLDR: ice ice baby. _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ ARK intraday trades for 14 Dec _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ I just bet $50,000 on VXX for this week. Here's why: Positions first so you know this ain't bs:

https://preview.redd.it/66dzf3hsl9561.png?width=2706&format=png&auto=webp&s=59f34667e618e235010a50114d6b36972246157e

Now the reasons:

&#x200B;

1. Fed meeting tomorrow and wed. Now that we have a vaccine they are going to be less inclined to make monetary policy any easier and may even tighten. We are at artificial ath's and they don't necessarily want to pump more when they don't have to. At a certain point they are going to need to start protecting the dollar as the situation is getting worse for it rapidly.
2. Stimulus talks looking worse and worse. McConnell doesn't want to pass anything and we may not have any bill at all. Again, no need to send in more money when stocks are already high enough and pump further. I foresee them waiting on the bill until Feb or so and then assessing the situation then.
3. GA Runoff looking more and more like it could go to both Dems. Trump complaining about it. If both dems get seat then we have a 50-50 senate and deciding vote is Kamala. That is essentially a unified dem government so a lot of big players are going to exit the market to avoid the tax situation that dems want to push.
4. People selling to take losses on the year, or even to take gains and offsetting with loss taking as well.
5. Now that we have vaccine and things are going back to normal, people are going to use their money to buy things to impress their neighbors, as well as have experiences and travel instead of putting everything into the market as they've been doing for the past 9 months simply because there hasn't been anything to buy.

&#x200B;

All of these could go the other way of course as well, but for now they look like they are pointing down. Any changes in the market and I cut the position but for now it's looking good.

&#x200B;

Edit: How do I turn off comments to people below the age of 18? Seems like 95% of people here just learned about stocks this week. STFU if you don't have anything useful to contribute, I don't care about your opinion.

Hello Fellow Autists, I have an opportunity I wish to present to you that. 

The company is Atlas Air (AAWW). I once wrote a DD on this company a few months ago and I was right with earning blowing away expectations however I was wrong with how far OTM I should've been and only made tiny profits. This article is not an earnings play at the moment. But rather to capitalize off catalysts and protentional breakout according to technicals. 

Atlas Air Worldwide is a leader in global airfreight, that serves freight, commercial, charter, and military customers. If you ever had an iPhone or PlayStation 3-5, or watched a San Diego Chargers game you've probably been impacted by Atlas Air. They have a combination of an efficient fleet, cost-saving operations, and superior customer service. With nearly 3,600 employees working across 90 countries, Atlas Air generated 2019 net sales of $2.74 billion. 

They provide ACMI (Aircraft, Crew, Maintenance, and Insurance), whereby they provide outsourced cargo and passenger aircraft operating solutions, including the provision of an aircraft, crew, maintenance and insurance, while customers assume fuel, demand and price risk. In addition, customers are generally responsible for landing, navigation and most other operational fees and costs;.

[Atlas Air 747-400 ](https://preview.redd.it/21fcmxahb9561.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=a6072d3f0ec86050ac1dc2ea0ffb802c61b4b110)

 The company recently strengthened and diversified its business and fleet with a focus on serving express and e-commerce, which has positioned it well to handle the increased demand in online orders and the future distribution of vaccines.¬† In the third quarter, management saw strong demand for their long-haul wide-body services. The company anticipates solid volumes in the fourth quarter, driven by continued e-commerce growth. They recently made a deal with Alibaba (BABA) to send their consumer's merchandise to South America and  allowing them to grow operations there.

 The stock has a Forward P/E ratio of 7.69. This compares to its industry's average Forward P/E of 15.53. Their biggest competitor is Air Transport Services group (ATSG) who even though has a bigger market cap, higher P/E ratio of 15.97, also happens to have a smaller fleet then Atlas Air and does not have the 747-800 which is the newest model of the 747 and most fuel efficient while carrying more weight which in this industry is crucial and helps them stand out from their competitors.  

 A resistance level has formed in the chart of Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings Inc.¬† If this level is crossed, a breakout could occur.  

AAWW saw strong earnings and revenue growth in the third quarter with earnings up 667.6% year over year and revenue up 24.9%. The stock is trading at a low valuation with a Price to Sales ratio of 0.5 and a Price to Book ratio of 0.7.

The company‚Äôs cash position for the third quarter was $718 million, up from $72 million in the same quarter last year. Though that is considerably lower than its long-term debt of $2.4 Billion. AAWW has shown strong long-term momentum, but is down over the short-term. 

 AAWW has formed an important level to watch at the $57.50 (blue) mark shown below on the chart. That level was supported back in September and October, and now it has become resistance after the stock fell below it. Although it appears the stock might be headed lower, a break back above $57.50 likely means higher prices for AAWW. 

 Therefore you guys could enter a long position on a break above the resistance level with a protective stop placed under it.

 There are multiple catalysts that could cause this stock to break out. 

The first one is the fact that the company is being apart of the vaccine distribution and is expected for the next year to help distribute the vaccine because their aircraft can support and hold the refrigerators to carry the vaccines since they have to be kept cold. 

Second catalyst. Atlas Air has a partnership with amazon where amazon leases their fleet to transport all their shit all over the world. With the epidemic and amazon growing like crazy this has only lead Atlas Air to grow. Amazon has warrants to buy up to 23% of the company by end of 2023. And its Christmas and I have a feeling Christmas records for Amazon are about to be shattered which means Atlas Air will be busy. Also typically around Christmas through February the stock has a history of being at it's highest for the year around that time because it is their busiest season.

Third catalyst. Growth. Atlas Air is adding to its fleet and is hiring more pilots to tackle the tasks at hand. Also passenger airlines typically when doing international trips hold additional cargo in their hull to make more profits, but with less international flights due to Covid Atlas Air has had growth in customers asking them to hull freight. And assuming Atlas Air does good with these customers and makes them happy their clientele should expect to grow.  

Forth catalyst. Gasoline is pretty cheap, even though it is rising in price with vaccine news, it is still much cheaper then previously before for aircraft.

Fifth Catalyst maybe? As the coronavirus chaos is beginning to come to an end and super sexy overvalued tech companies are no longer as attractive this can lead to an emphasis on value and funds will be longer for their next growth prospects and this provides opportunity for value and growth and a way to capitalize off the coronavirus vaccine, amazon holiday season, and a ever changing world. 

To summarize, this is a well ran growing company and the stock price is poised for a breakout with a combination of these catalysts. The company is no where near its all time high yet it is the best it has ever been financially. The company is also owned over 90% by institutional investors so there is lots of smart money in the company who recognize value and the next earnings report is in February and this company tends to have a run up towards earnings. 

Literally Can't go tits up. 

I wrote this instead of taking my macroeconomics exam so I hope you enjoyed it. 

Positions

\-57.50 1/15 Calls

"An update on our recent test flight; we landed beautifully, with pilots, planes, andspaceship safe, secure, and in excellent shape ‚Äî the foundation of every successful mission!

The flight did not reach space as we had been planning. After being released from itsmothership, the spaceship‚Äôs onboard computer that monitors the rocket motor lost connection. As designed, this triggered a fail-safe scenario that intentionally halted ignition of the rocket motor. Following this occurrence, our pilots flew back to Spaceport Americaand landed gracefully as usual.

When I joined Virgin Galactic, I was briefed on the safety engineering of our SpaceflightSystem, which is purposely designed to enable our pilots to safely glide back to theSpaceport at any point during the flight profile. Seeing firsthand how our pilots brought Unity in for a picture perfect landing after an off-nominal condition confirmed this approach. I am even more confident that this is the level of safety that consumers will want and will be expecting from us.

As we do with every test flight, we are evaluating all the data, including the root cause assessment of the computer communication loss.

We remain focused on the test flight program we have previously announced, beginning with a repeat of this test flight, which included two pilots and NASA payloads. This will befollowed by another test flight which will include mission specialists in the cabin. Andfollowing that flight, we will have another test flight which will include our founder, Richard Branson."

I keep these charts simple because we are all autists. When the green and cyan line crosses over the red line the stock follows. Now the green and cyan have crossed above which tends to mean increases ahead. On the next chart beneath, we need the green to cross the red upwards and the purple on the very bottom chart to start to rise for liftoff. 

Can get in now with this pessimistic market attitude for cheap or wait until there is a solid green day for CRM for confirmation.

On a longer-term scale, CRM is in a massive bull flag and the current price is hitting the lower channel. 

Good support at this range at about $220. 

The recent drop was because they are buying $WORK, which recently became profitable. The deal was made at a $28B valuation cost and $CRM lost $36B in valuation because of it. 

In with 1/15/2021 $230 Calls, can go longer out for less risk._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Identifying ROADBLOCKS to getting IPO Options Tendies Hey team, some quick helpful tips on how to do options when a stock IPOs, and a couple of FAQs that come up from time to time:

1: When a stock IPOs, there's no options for at least three (3) business days. The CBOE (Chicago Board Options Exchange) do this because they want to make sure the stock price has kind of stabilized and they can have an idea of how to price the options (figuring out how all those Greeks are going to go).

2: When options first open, it's like the fucking beaches of Normandy on D-Day. You've seen the movies.  Be real careful. The doors to the landing crafts open, and the first round of autists pile onto the beach with their ridiculous shitcalls, only to get torn to shreds in a hail of gunfire. That's the opening scene of your Tendie Termination. Low Open Interest means the market hasn't figured out how to price the options yet (least of all you), so the Bid/Ask spreads are gaped out worse than when that Chad of a boyfriend is done with your wife. You'll cross B/A spreads that make up 25-50% of the value of the option - meaning you might need to double your value just to break even. It's a rough scene.

3: Market makers like round numbers, which makes higher open interest and closer B/A spreads - you save money on a more mature market. For example, look at PLTR May 21 '21 $30c vs. the $31c: The $30c have a B/A spread of $6.10 to $6.45 - a 35 cent spread (about 5%) - by comparison, the $31c have a spread of 5.50 to 6.55 - a $1.05 spread (or\~16%!). The $31 may look cheaper, but in reality you're getting a shittier deal of crossing that massive B/A.

4: OTM Call Options typically don't go higher than either 50% or 100% of the underlying stock's highest value. I've written letters to CBOE begging and pleading for more, and they won't do it. Look at Tesla - it's ATH was $654, and the highest its options can go is $1200 (at least until Daddy Elon Tweets a pic of him and Alex Karp docking together and moons both stocks to $6969.420).

TL;DR: Don't pile into the IPO unless you're terminally ill and hate your grandkids. Don't buy Options on the day they're first available. Buy round numbers to get a better bargain.

Positions: An irresponsibly large amount $SHLDQ options on the fourth business day of trading, probably in January by the look of it.

The media hasn't covered it much but the importance of this historical deal will be unprecedented for the African continent.

The agreement initially requires members to **remove tariffs  from 90% of goods,** allowing free access to commodities, goods, and services across the continent.

Key elements:

* Create a single market, deepening the economic integration of the continent.
* Enhance competitiveness of member states within Africa and in the global market.
* Aid the movement of capital and people, facilitating investment.
* Achieve sustainable and inclusive socio-economic development.

Highlights from the World Bank:

* *With the implementation of AfCFTA, trade facilitation measures that cut red tape and simplify customs procedures would drive $292 billion of the* ***$450 billion in potential income gains.***
* *The African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) presents a major opportunity for African countries to bring 30 million people out of extreme poverty and to raise the incomes of 68 million others.*

The [United Nations Economic Commission for Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Economic_Commission_for_Africa) estimates that the agreement **will boost intra-African trade by 52 percent by 2022.**

($JMIA) has **6.7M active customers** and is the leading e-commerce platform in Africa. They recently sold 8M shares and raised $290M in cash with a $2.9B mkt cap.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/lat47jfal8561.png?width=200&format=png&auto=webp&s=554d1a2f77b4d1c32347e97b40357e0ea8427299

&#x200B;

During Q3 they outlined how they are planning to focus on **JumiaPay** so the customers are able to make online payments while avoiding the hurdles of dealing with cash. This prompted CNBC boomer Steve Weiss to compare JumiaPay as the Square of Africa. Not only Jumia will be able to maintain a dominant and growing position with e-commerce but they will also create a financial branch that will earn commissions on online payments and maybe provide loans to the third party vendors on their platform.

It's clear that AfCFTA will boost  African economies and $JMIA will be there to take their share.

**Positions: JAN 15 40C**_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ STEEL STALLIONS UNITE Hello my good autist friend, hope you're well. After seeing the Godfather [Vito](https://www.reddit.com/user/vitocorlene/) post a [DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kcqkax/steel_stocks_getting_ready_for_lift_off/?sort=new) about steel I started hyperventilating. The TLDR; version of Vito's DD is: **Steel demand is VERY high and supply is VERY low.** Go and read the DD as the guy has worked in the industry for a long time and clearly knows what he is talking about.

Now I ain't no fucking economist, I'm just a wall street autist, but I do know that there's a "supply and demand" economic law. Take a look at the graph below, friend.

&#x200B;

[IF SUPPLY IS LOW THEN PRICE IS HIGH.](https://preview.redd.it/5wqrmndx28561.png?width=1500&format=png&auto=webp&s=27d7a692a167a2a5b0c84d32311afef607e033c6)

So now that I refreshed your memory about supply and demand, let's go back in time.

It's 2008, steel is at an all time high. How high? Well the highest exporter of steel in the world as of 2019 $MT reached a wooping $245.53 on 6th of July 2008 before plumetting harder than $SPCE today because supply finally caught up with the demand.

Now I know you have many quesitons.. Why the fuck was it so high, yet today it's trading at $20?Why does my wife hate me? What happened in 2008???

Go read this article or just read the TLDR. But notice that this article was written in FEBRUARY 2008, 4 MONTHS BEFORE $MT reached an all time high of $250-ish..

[https://uk.reuters.com/article/businesspro-steel-prices-dc/global-steel-prices-the-sky-is-the-limit-idUSL0887074020080225](https://uk.reuters.com/article/businesspro-steel-prices-dc/global-steel-prices-the-sky-is-the-limit-idUSL0887074020080225)

TLDR;

\-Demand for steel remains high, although the Western economies just collapsed.-Coal prices SOAR. Coal is one of the main ingredients in steel production.-Exports from China fall, causing steel prices to MOON in Europe.-Experts predict steel price will continue to rise.

Rememeber the points above as we return to today.

So what's the situation right now? Vito summed it up best in his post "There is not relief in sight and many steel mills are having to purchase raw materials - iron ore and scrap at prices not seen since 2008."

Shoutout to [SteveMcHeave](https://www.reddit.com/user/SteveMcHeave/) for linking me to the [trading economics](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/steel-production) page where you can view each countries output of steel by month. If you Google "top 10 producers of steel", then view each countries steel production month by month, you will see that all major producers of steel are still at pre-covid levels of production except for China.

&#x200B;

[USA STEEL PRODUCTION \(ALL COUNTRIES LOOK VERY SIMILAR TO THIS GRAPH\)](https://preview.redd.it/7g5vcesr68561.png?width=1508&format=png&auto=webp&s=a2b845a09690b683515c3375c5e37891cb3e4744)

&#x200B;

[CHINA CAN'T SUPPLY THE WHOLE WORLD](https://preview.redd.it/mpnxbgc678561.png?width=1462&format=png&auto=webp&s=312025b269d0ecdb136f54abe62b00e289ca920c)

Steel mills are just starting back up and will probably reach pre-covid levels by end of year. I'm sure these mills have quite a few orders backloged because covid caused logistical issues. Suppliers couldn't deliver goods as countries shut their borders, local outbreaks at factories forced people to self isolate, etc, etc. And to add more fuel to the fire of DEMAND, vaccine news will allow world economies to start pumping again. Projects that are due to start in 2021 will begin and so will the demand for steel.

Okay one final thing.. COAL. Remember in 2008 how the price of coal soared by 65%?

Read [this article](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-10/iron-ore-futures-top-150-as-china-demand-fuels-late-year-surge)  TLDR;-$Vale lowers its target for iron delivery due to the dam disaster it had earlier. Vale is the second largest importer of iron to China.-Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley say coal prices will continue to be higher than usual into next year.-Australias bank says "If you chill the fuck out, mate, and reduce your steel production, coal will go back to normal prices". Probably won't happen as demand in west is starting to increase-Australias bad weather is causing supply issues.

Now you will probably go and do some more DD and see that China's steel mills have recently asked their governing bodies to investigate the price of coal coming in from Australia. I don't think this will have much of an impact on coal because the demand is high and the supply is dropping, prices are bound to increase. China started a trade war with Australia and banned a load of Australian imports, so things will only get more interesting from here.

As long as the supply is behind the demand, the price of steel will continue to rise. As price of steel continues to rise, so will the profits of the steel producers. God speed to you and I shall see you in tendy town. üöÄüöÄüöÄ

**TLDR;**

[READ THIS](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kcqkax/steel_stocks_getting_ready_for_lift_off/?sort=new)Steel price will rise as supply tries to catch up with the demand. The original DD who inspired this post thinks $MT will rise signlificantly over the next 8-12 weeks.

1. Buy $MT / Arcelor Mittal as they are the biggest supplier of steel in the world as of 2019
