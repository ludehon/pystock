It's simple.... this sub has become a wasteland for cast aside meme stocks.   Once they get pumped and the $$$ stops, the volume of pump posts dramatically slows down.

Just look at last weeks pumps.... NIO, BLNK, SOLO, XPEV....  


But where are the posts now?  Nowhere to be found.... but people still own them.   Baggie bagholders.

So, take that knowledge that there are weak hands holding unloved stocks, hoping that someone takes them out higher.  Take the other side.  Use gamma in your favor on the downside.   Market makers are hedged with stock because of your CALL buying.   That gamma will reverse with PUT buying.    They'll need to sell stock and your PUTs will moon.

Just remember that when you degenerates move on from PLTR, you can make money as the light dims and the pump fades.

Just don't be the last bag standing._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $CRSR, Gaming Peripherals and Black Friday It's no surprise to anyone that the pandemic has led to rapid growth in the sales of Gaming PCs. Schools are closed, dad's unemployed, and everyone is stuck finding entertainment at home. As a result, global shipments of gaming PCs and monitors are expected to [increase 16.2% year over year](https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS46896420)  to 49.6 million units in 2020.

Now that little Jimmy already has a gaming PC, what's Grandma going to get him for Christmas? That's right, a light-up gaming [mouse](https://www.amazon.com/Corsair-Nightsword-Performance-Tunable-Backlit/dp/B07QX9C9WH/ref=sr_1_5?crid=2D0W89PY06VGM&dchild=1&keywords=corsair+gaming+mouse+keyboard&qid=1606681316&sprefix=corsair+gaming+mouse+k%2Caps%2C172&sr=8-5) and [keyboard](https://www.amazon.com/CORSAIR-K55-RGB-Gaming-Keyboard/dp/B01M4LIKLI/ref=sr_1_4?crid=2D0W89PY06VGM&dchild=1&keywords=corsair+gaming+mouse+keyboard&qid=1606681316&sprefix=corsair+gaming+mouse+k%2Caps%2C172&sr=8-4). Gaming peripherals are relatively inexpensive gifts that are going to be wrapped under the tree for millions of children to open on Christmas morning.

For Corsair Gaming $CRSR the sales of gaming peripherals in the third quarter [grew 128.8% year-over-year](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/11/10/2123626/0/en/Corsair-Gaming-Reports-Third-Quarter-2020-Financial-Results.html). Sales of these items are a cash cow for producers because of their high margins (For Corsair, gaming peripherals had a [37.1% gross profit margin](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/11/10/2123626/0/en/Corsair-Gaming-Reports-Third-Quarter-2020-Financial-Results.html) in the third quarter compared to a [23% gross profit margin](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/11/10/2123626/0/en/Corsair-Gaming-Reports-Third-Quarter-2020-Financial-Results.html) for gaming systems). Due to tailwinds in supply-chain efficiency, these products are becoming even more profitable for Corsair (gross profit margin on gaming peripherals [grew 31.1% year-over-year](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/11/10/2123626/0/en/Corsair-Gaming-Reports-Third-Quarter-2020-Financial-Results.html) in the third quarter). Increased sales and growing margins led to Corsair's whopping [200.8% year-over-year growth](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/11/10/2123626/0/en/Corsair-Gaming-Reports-Third-Quarter-2020-Financial-Results.html) in gross profit from gaming peripherals.

Corsair has estimated that Q4 revenue will be between [$470M and $485M.](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/11/10/2123626/0/en/Corsair-Gaming-Reports-Third-Quarter-2020-Financial-Results.html). 

Now, let's look back at how Corsair's revenue has typically grown due to Christmas shopping (Data compiled from [Q3 Report](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/11/10/2123626/0/en/Corsair-Gaming-Reports-Third-Quarter-2020-Financial-Results.html) and [S-1 Filing](https://ir.corsair.com/static-files/93418f4d-ffd9-42da-930e-c1f3a9fc1fb6)). In the fourth quarter of 2019, revenue grew 14.8% from revenue in the third quarter of 2019. If a 2020 has the same 14.8% growth from the third quarter, then Q4 revenue will be $525M, exceeding even the high end of current Q4 estimates. Revenue in the last six months of 2018 grew 8.0% from the revenue in the first six months of 2018. Revenue in the last six months of 2019 grew 25.6% from the revenue in the first six months of 2019. If 2020 follows a similar trend, then revenue in the last six months of 2020 will be 43.3% higher than the first six months of 2020, and Q4 revenue will be $530M, which exceeds even the high end of current Q4 estimates

The forecast looks great for Corsair exceeding their Q4 estimates, but what does this mean for their stock price? CRSR has recently fallen over 24% from its ATH of $51.37 after rising 80% over a span of eight trading days. This pullback is creating a buying opportunity before record Black Friday and Cyber Monday online sales numbers are released. CRSR 5/21/21 $50 calls have fallen from their high of $15 and CRSR 5/31/31 $40 calls have fallen from their high of $19. Gradually entering a position in these can lead to an outsized return as online sales numbers and the Q4 report in February drive the stock price up.

TL;DR $CRSR 5/21/21 $40c and $CRSR 5/21/21 $50c_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Thought in the $ZI puts another user was talking about?

Only going up from here and all the smart money realizes - hopefully some of you have enough chromosomes to do whats right and yolo ur ass in here._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ This the my current equity on Robinhood. I want to move some money around to capitalize on the crazy market. Any suggestions? _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ The next big stock. The next hot thing on the market. Guys hear me out. This can be a fucking play of the century. Here‚Äôs the next stonk - JMIA. Yes JMIA, you‚Äôve probably never heard of it‚Ä¶ But lemme just say that it‚Äôs a fucking gold mine in an underdeveloped market. 

Ok, imma quickly explain why the company is undervalued and even more than that ‚Äì the company is underhyped. 

Jumia is basically an African version of Amazon. It‚Äôs taking the already proven e-Commerce business model and taking it to an underdeveloped African market. What I‚Äôm saying here is, that it basically has huge growth potential. It‚Äôs already in a strong position to dominate Africa, as it already represents most of the online sales on the continent, but as you‚Äôll see it‚Äôs just gonna get better. 

Africa has about $4.0 trillion in household spending - similar to South America ($4.8 trillion). Most of the spending is still offline (like in the US before Amazon), but as Africa‚Äôs internet usage is gonna start increasing, a lot of spending is gonna start moving to an online platform (Jumia). The closest example to an e-Commerce platform that grew recently in an emerging market is Mercado Libre, which grew in South America. Obviously, the challenges in South America and Africa are different in many ways as Africa is probably worse in terms of infrastructure, but in terms of opportunity, they're not that different.

Mercado Libre is currently valued at $75 billion, which could get a lot bigger in the future, but if you look at Jumia, it is only valued at $3 billion. The companies are obviously at a much different stage. Mercado Libre has 175 million users and Jumia is only at 6.8 million users, but take into consideration the massive amount of user growth year over year and the fact that Africa is projected to have the fastest-growing population between now and 2050, the growth of the platform is gonna be big. It's hard to not see Jumia moving in the direction of Mercado Libre. Obviously, Jumia is an early-stage company, but people do not buy based on current numbers, they buy based on future numbers. And based on future numbers, the company is extremely undervalued. 

Now that we‚Äôve got some basic DD out of the way, imma get to the main point. I do think, as stated above, that this is a valuable company and I believe in its domination in the African market over the next 20 to 30 years, but we are not investors, we are traders, so why bother with the next 20 to 30 years you might ask. The reason that I'm talking about this now is that I think this is a very, very powerful story to sell to investors and I‚Äôd say that we are about a couple of away, before it really starts getting sold to the investors. We‚Äôre here before the hype. Before the major investors start hoarding in. Once it gets noticed either by investors or one of the already existing e-Commerce like Amazon or Alibaba, the stock is gonna start mooning. 

If Jumia is gonna keep up the numbers, big investors are gonna start coming in. We are here before that. 

JMIA TO THE MOON._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ PLTR investors tomorrow _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Konga - The True Amazon of Africa, Jumia will crash and burn  

1. 9% revenue decline year over year: 147m 2020 vs 161m 2019. Declining revenues during a pandemic where online shopping has increased and all ecommerce giants have posted recorded setting revenues and profits. (revenue decline can also be attributed to loss of market share to Konga)
2. Gross merchandise value down 15% year over year. IE the total value of all merchandise has decreased 15% from prior year.
3. Business mix - to offset the decrease in merchandise sales they have expanded to food delivery, Jumiapay and Gaming. While introducing all these new product mixes their revenue has still declined 9% from the prior year. All these sectors will require cash injections to have any possibility to generate revenue.
4. Competition Konga - Jumia is no longer the main player in Africa. Konga has seen explosive growth since 2018 when it was acquired by Zinox Group. Posting 800% increase in sales and reducing losses by 70% in a 18 month period. They are already exceeding 1 million in daily sales (2.5x Jumia currently daily sales) and plan to hit over 3B in sales by 2024. They have been eyeing a IPO with a value of 3 Billion. Once this company does IPO investors will flee from Jumia into Konga as their revenue growth cannot be ignored. On purely a revenue valuation Jumia should be at 1.2B compared to Konga's 3.2B valuation and this is not considering Konga's revenue growth and improved margins. Konga is actively looking to expand into all english speaking western African markets over the next couple of years.

5. Potential Market - While Africa does have a population of 1.5 billion people, there are over 50 different countries most of which have awful infrastructure. Whether it be roads, addresses or even the internet. This is evident as last year they decided to close down distribution centers in 5 different countries last year due to unprofitability. (Cameroon, Tanzania, Gabon, Congo, Rwanda Ect) Management continues to make irresponsible decisions that just increases Jumia's burn rate, not to mention once a company pulls out of a country it has a much harder time penetrating it in the future.

6. Cash Burn Rate - JMIA is burning through cash, net cash position of 100m as of 09/30/2020 after trade payables come due. Cash Burn rate of 182m per year in 2019, leaving JMIA with enough cash until March-April 2021.

7. Shelf offering registration - In July 2020 they registered for a shelf offering which allows JMIA to issue up to 36 million shares when they deem necessary to secure funds. This offering will come prior to March 2021, it may happen even sooner if they are trying to expand operations and continue entering into new product lines.

8.Citron Pump: Citron put out a pump article. Look at their short report in May 2019 where they shorted this stock from 45$ to $5. Nothing has changed in this company with the exception of decreased revenue, a worsening cash position. Citron Loaded up on this stock in the 15$ range and will dump their holdings and short it back down, making money on the way up and down like they always do. See $LRN for their most recent stock pump. All Citron does is load up on short float stocks and put out pump articles or short rallying stocks/hot sectors and release hit pieces.

9. Insider selling: Cofounders - Jeremy and Sacha sold off 400k shares last week. If insiders are selling at these prices, institutional investors will be to. Some institutions have had their funds locked up since IPO and will be selling their positions as volume and price increase.

Dec 18 $25 Puts_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ A Palantir post made its way to my feed randomly when it was at $15, bought some on a whim, and then became interested on what else was in here, so I made a site that tracks the most mentioned stocks from the top daily/hourly post titles/text as a mock portfolio (wsb_portfolio). _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Forget Quarterly Earnings So I see a lot of people buying options just before quarterly earnings and I'm thinking to myself "the uncertainty is basically already priced into the option premium". If you're looking for a fair shake on your dice roll for a big-risk, big-reward scenario, just go for biotech stocks about to release Phase 2/3 results or applying for marketing authorization.

For example, if you want to play a simple stock trade, RVVTF is posting interim results on their Phase 3 COVID therapy clinical trial sometime in December (probably a few days before or after Christmas). OBSV just applied for marketing authorization on their drug in the EU, and will probably get a response in early February, 2021. If you wanted to do an option trade with OBSV, you could buy March/April/May calls in late January.

You can expect a modest run-up in the time between for both of these examples, but the big move will happen after the event and the market makers don't seem to know that they should be pricing that in for those theta gang types.

PLTR 40C 12/4_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Question: Do technical analysis strategies work better with stocks that have certain characteristics? TLDR at bottom

So some background info and disclaimer:

I'm a younger, newer investor who got in at the beginning of May with basic layman knowledge of the markets, so apologies for any ignorance or stupid questions. So anyway, when I casually mentioned my interest in the stock market after the huge crash in March, my parents and some immediate family members were extremely supportive, so much so that they basically gifted me 30k to start an account.

As lucky and grateful as I am to have all this capital to work with, I have not been able to take proper advantage of it out of fear of failure. I haven't made any trades after loading up on tech during the recovery after the initial COVID sell-off, and in the meantime, I've been studying up on both fundamental and technical, boomer and wallstreetbets, value investing vs YOLOs (basically, trying to learn all perspectives so that I can confidently choose my own preferred style). I started with the Intelligent Investor by Ben Graham, moved on the One Up on Wall Street by Peter Lynch, and am now reading Irrational Exuberance by Robert Shiller in addition to taking an online technical analysis/daytrading course.

My question popped into my head as I was listening to the aforementioned daytrading course. I found myself wondering: "if there are certain characteristics of stocks that attract the attention of value investors like Graham, Buffet, and Lynch and prompt them to investigate further, are there equivalent characteristics for technical traders?" I mean, there are dedicated screeners that anyone can use that find stocks based on Graham's values and principles, and Lynch lays out his own criteria like "boring stock rich in assets in a boring industry with little no to institutional interest" for finding potential ten-baggers that retail investors could follow.

Which brings us to the question itself: Are there certain characteristics that short-term, technical day/swing traders screen for or like to see in their trade setups? From what I've been learning so far, the stock should be relatively liquid, and the more people using the technical chart setups that you are using, the better the probability that it will work out. But other than trading volume (and the presence of chart/indicator setups ofc), are there any other boxes a technical trader should check before pulling the trigger on a trade?

TLDR: Basically, tell me how to screen for stocks that have underlying traits that complement technical strategies, and if there are no such things let me know so I can go buy myself a dart monkey.

Lightning eMotors (GIK) - Colorado based, these guys are fleet electrification similar to XL Fleet/PIC,  install electric powertrains into Ford and Chevy chassis and sell them along with charging station and infrastructure. They said in Oct that they doubled their storage, capacity, and employees to meet new and continuing order demand, and going public via Gigacapital3 Inc. These guys are currently valued at about $1B and have way more to show than some of these EV companies who literally haven't put out a damn thing, and their market cap is under $350 mil.

YOLO on GME anyone? _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Series 24 Exam Hello beautiful & special people - bit of an odd post but please bear with me as I'd appreciate any & all help any of you may be able to give me. I think WSB will appreciate this one a lot, true unadulterated autism shining its brightest.

My close friend recently bet me (essentially a freeroll, no risk on my end) a large sum of money that I wouldn't be able to take a Series 24 exam & be granted a license by this time next year, and so I was curious as to how one might begin approaching such a feat - by someone who essentially knows very little about the market & trading (I've dabbled a bit and am familiar with the basics & some elements of options trading but that's about it).

The bet amount is such that I am willing to basically do whatever it takes, so if anyone would be able to tell me if this is feasible, point me in the right direction of where to begin, etc. I'd truly appreciate it (If you're a qualified individual and can prove it I'd also be willing to pay you to help me along the way for a year, given it's a task possible to undertake to begin with).

Their ITM puts for July (probably bought because they couldn't find any more shares to short with) are now OTM. They probably have an actual short position too (don't have to file that in an 13F) they're also underwater on. No one else has a put position this big in the 13F's.

What are the chances they're responsible for half the short interest? It'd make sense on why we're not seeing significant covering on GME yet. They're a bunch of stubborn boomers that have collateral in the billions. It wouldn't be crazy if they made a $200 million bet on Gamestop becoming the next Blockbuster when it was under $6. They've made similar bets in the past like their $400 million short on Nintendo back in 2018.

&#x200B;

For those that don't know how short selling works, please keep the following in mind as we're buying the dip so you're not adding to the problem.

When there's a large amount of volume, short sellers will start putting the Ask below the current share price. When you quickly buy at the ask, you're helping them to run the price down, as they continue to put lower and lower Asks in. 

The reason this works is because the levels of support are not as strong. How do you inverse this? Simply put your limit order bids in, instead of putting through a market order.  If support is strong, they can't run the price down in an effort to fill their own bids.

That should be good enough DD, but if you‚Äôre not convinced, read on.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

FROG is a newly public software company with a good moat, rapidly growing revenue base, fat margins, and drastically undervalued share price compared to its peers.

&#x200B;

**Business Overview**

\- Software company that streamlines the development process by providing necessary tools and visibility

\- Enables ability to software to update continuously without the user knowing

\- Functional alongside Azure, AWS, Google cloud

\- 5800+ customers w/ 75% of Fortune 500 companies as customers including Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and Netflix (yes, even big tech is using Jfrog‚Äôs product)

\- Exclusive partnerships (Atlssian, Pure Software, Microsoft Azure, AWS, Google Cloud) with many best in class cloud providers limit potential competition

\- $22bn TAM with a $18bn opportunity for FROG by 2024 (company estimates)

\- FROG‚Äôs flagship product is Artifactory, which functions as package/binary storage. They do face legitimate competition here from Github and Gitlab, but FROG is **far and away the leader in this space.** This is because FROG supports significantly more types of package formats (25+ vs. 6 and 3 respectively). Having the **best binary/package manager** is ultimately what drives FROG‚Äôs value proposition and what separates them from their competitors. Since they are best-in-class here, FROG can cross and upsell their customers with other products. Simply, FROG attracts customers with their best-in-class product Artifactory and then can upsell other products. Their products become integral in a company‚Äôs software stack to the extent that there is very little customer turnover (see extremely high net dollar retention rate below).

&#x200B;

**Incentivized Leadership**

\- FROG was founded 10 years ago and still led by same 3 founders who own 20% of shares outstanding

\- Board and other managers own another 33% of shares outstanding

\- Leadership clearly incentivized to make this thing rocket

&#x200B;

**Financials**

\- $206.3M revenue expected FY2021

\- Q3 2020 revenue was $38.9M, increasing 40% yoy

\- 81% Q3 gross margin, ranked 4th among top SAAS companies

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rjyok6und8261.png?width=1950&format=png&auto=webp&s=49abd795025cb67c6196aa4f3b93975867d90780

\- Net dollar retention rate of 136% indicates customers are ‚Äúextremely sticky‚Äù

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/u73ue4uod8261.png?width=1950&format=png&auto=webp&s=d64f8bf5887b198688faf75f7230e690b7d1f04e

\- LTM CAC Payback of 16 months is best-in-class. This is an industry specific term and represents the amount of time it takes until the revenue generated from acquiring a customer exceeds the cost of doing so. FROG‚Äôs value is extremely impressive here, as its growing revenues at a whopping 40% YoY without much of a sales and marketing spend.

\- Compared to peers, FROG is ‚ÄúBest-in-class‚Äù or ‚ÄúGreat‚Äù with respect to each key SAAS statistic

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/pluwa6ird8261.png?width=1950&format=png&auto=webp&s=1424c9fb650a2ee5024f1cbac22348b012bbdb40

**Relative Valuation**

I'm not a huge fan of DCF's when it comes to valuing these growth names because some of the assumptions you're forced to make about business conditions 5-10yrs down the road determine the bulk of the company's value. A simple change in the longterm growth rate might change the company's enterprise value by 25%. I think the proper way to value FROG is by looking at their peers' valuation multiple (which reflects current market conditions favoring late duration cash flows) and determining FROG's value from there.

&#x200B;

\- FROG trading at \~ 30x expected 2021 revenue

\- DDOG trading at \~40x expected 2021 revenue

\- SNOW trading at \~100x expected 2021 revenue

\- PLTR trading at \~50x expected 2021 revenue

\- ZM trading at \~50x expected 2021 revenue

&#x200B;

While SNOW‚Äôs valuation seems a bit crazy, it‚Äôs a valuable exercise to walk through what FROG would look like if it was valued like its peers. If FROG were to trade at:

&#x200B;

40x expected 2021 revenue -> $92.49/share or 33% upside

45x expected 2021 revenue -> $104.05/share or 50% upside

50x expected 2021 revenue -> $115.62/share or 67% upside

(for kicks) 100x expected 2021 revenue -> $231.23 or 233% upside

&#x200B;

Obviously FROG isn‚Äôt growing revenue quite at SNOW‚Äôs rate, so a 100x multiple might be a bit extreme, but given current valuation levels, FROG‚Äôs 40% YoY growth rate should drive a valuation multiple in the 40x-50x range, yielding FROG significant upside.

&#x200B;

**Recent Big Money Call Buying**

\- Recent large amounts of call buying indicate smart money is positioning bullishly for an end of year run-up.

**Recent Performance**

After hitting a post-IPO high of $95 per share, FROG fell all the way to $57.14 before catching a bid late this past week with outsized volume. In doing so, FROG just broke through a recent downtrend and looks primed to breakout and test ATHs before the year‚Äôs end, especially with fresh volume, bullish option positioning, and a likely rotation back to tech amid a resurgence in COVID-19.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/w7it1fqtd8261.png?width=1450&format=png&auto=webp&s=ec270a9acc019633a1559b2c725b9c978176b0b1

**TLDR**

FROG is a well-positioned, rapidly growing software company and is drastically undervalued compared to other hot tech companies. As smart money piles in and attention shifts back to growth after a brief vaccine rotation to value, expect FROG to hit ATH‚Äôs in late 2020/early 2021

**Positions**

FROG 80c 12/18/20

FROG 90c 12/18/20

FROG 80c 1/15/21

FROG 90c 1/15/21

***Happy gambling retards!***

**If interested, here's an neat description of FROG's platform from their S-1**, "We built the world‚Äôs first universal package repository, JFrog Artifactory, to fundamentally transform the way that the software release cycle is managed. Our package-based approach to releasing software enabled the category of CSRM, allowing software releases to be continuous and software to always be current.

We enable organizations to store all package types in a common repository where they can be edited, tracked, and managed. Our unified platform connects all of the software release processes involved in buildingand releasing software, enabling CSRM. We empower our customers to shorten their software release cycles and enable the continuous flow of current, up-to-date software from any source to any destination. Our platform is designed to be agnostic to the programming languages, source code repositories, and development technologies that our customers use, and the type of production environments to which they deploy.

Our fully integrated suite of products allows our customers to compile software from source code repositories, manage the dependencies among components within software packages, move packages to a universal repository, ingest packages from third parties, including open source libraries, scan for vulnerabilities through various stages, distribute to endpoints, and deploy in production, all through a single user access point."

[The Economist: Why 2020 has been rotten for quant funds](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2020/11/21/why-2020-has-been-rotten-for-quant-funds)

Quants rely on history. This year has had few precedent

[Full article pasted below]

WHAT IS IT like to lose to a machine? In 1997 the world‚Äôs best chess player, Garry Kasparov, was beaten by Deep Blue, a $10m super-computer made by IBM. Twenty years later he wrote ‚ÄúDeep Thinking‚Äù, a book about the experience. What comes across vividly is how exhausting each game was. Chess players, even great ones like Mr Kasparov, get tired and frustrated. Doubts begin to creep in. By contrast, Deep Blue just needed the occasional reboot.

Now turn the tables. What is it like to win against the machines? By New Year‚Äôs Eve the least smart buy-and-hold investor in an index fund might be able to boast of such a victory. For 2020 has been rotten for ‚Äúquant‚Äù funds, which use powerful computers to sift market data for patterns that might predict future prices. ‚ÄúLong-short‚Äù momentum‚Äîbuying recent winners and selling recent losers‚Äîhad been one of quant‚Äôs better strategies this year. Yet on November 9th, when news broke of an effective vaccine for covid-19, it had its worst ever day.

Quants rely on history. If something happens that is without precedent, such as a vaccine in a pandemic, they have a problem. No doubt a few quant hedge funds are nursing heavy losses. And perhaps a few discretionary funds have made a killing. The terrain on which human traders can beat the machines is much diminished. But November 9th shows it is still possible. Chalk it up as a small victory for the species.

It is no small irony that momentum trading takes advantage of human weaknesses. One of these is ‚Äúconservatism bias‚Äù. Investors tend to stick to prior views too rigidly and change them only slowly in response to new information. They may give undue emphasis to the price paid for a stock as a marker of its true value and, as a consequence, sell winning stocks too soon and hang on to dud stocks for too long. There is also a contrasting tendency to extrapolate past success. So as well as under-reacting to news, people also over-react to it. Momentum trading seeks to exploit this.

A lot of long-short strategies, including momentum, rank stocks by a particular attribute and then buy the top decile (or quintile) of the group and sell the bottom one. This requires machines. Sorting through thousands of securities quickly is beyond the meagre talents of a living, breathing portfolio manager. It requires algorithms that first establish and then fine-tune the optimal period over which to do the sorting. And it needs speedy and seamless access to automatic trading platforms and market data. You would not want to do all this by hand and brain.

In chess, the brute force of computing power eventually wins out. In investing, the strength of synthetic traders is in dealing with reams of information that is machine-readable, such as tick-by-tick stock prices. The most powerful machines can make sense even of unstructured (‚Äúbig‚Äù) data. But an event like the discovery of a vaccine can flummox even the smartest of them. Humans retain an edge. They are able to winnow down endless possibilities using mental shortcuts. They can imagine scenarios that the past has not thrown up‚Äîscenarios such as ‚Äúa vaccine may become available soon, given the amount of money and effort being thrown at it‚Äù; and ‚Äúnews of such a vaccine might spark a sell-off in ‚Äòstay-at-home‚Äô shares and a rally in ‚Äòget-out-of-the-house‚Äô shares‚Äù.

But why were the moves in prices so dramatic? A good rule of thumb, says one quant guru, is that the faster you trade, the less capacity there is for your strategy. A speedy trading strategy, such as momentum, relies on liquid markets to keep turnover costs in check. The strategy can become crowded. And when the quants suffer losses, they may be forced by risk-management rules to close their positions. As everyone rushes to get out at the same time, it makes for extreme price movements. This is in part why sophisticated quant funds are constantly evolving. They look for unique datasets on which to train their machines. Or they try to come up with new ways to parse weaker signals that others cannot detect in the market noise.

The quants have had a rough time, but they are hardly in retreat. Their domain will only expand. The margin of advantage for discretionary trading‚Äîfor human ingenuity, in other words‚Äîwill shrink. It is worth remembering that the first time Mr Kasparov played against Deep Blue, in 1996, he won. Now, as he has pointed out, you can download free chess engines that are far more powerful. We should savour victories over the machines while we can.

[https://charlierose.com/videos/12809](https://charlierose.com/videos/12809)

For those who still question what it is Palantir does:

**Alexander Karp:** Our approach is, when the government takes the data, it's tagged in a way that shows the source. So it can't be migrated from the data they have taken from you to a case they have pending. And this is enormous.

**Charlie Rose:** So they take the data and you make sure they tag it.

**Alexander Karp:** If you use our platform, we take that data and adjust it. It's tagged. If it is migrated into a case that they have made against you, your defense attorneys will see that and say OK, this data came from data I gave you. This is enormously important. You won't help to buy in to have the government protect you unless you know that your liberties are going to be protected. And this is something we do kind of turnkey, or as we say in the Valley, out of the box. Whether you use us or whether you build the system, that's not my point. These kinds of things have to be built in and baked in and they have to be discussed with the American people.

**Charlie Rose:** I am always perplexed by this question -- if the CIA can hire people like you, like Palantir Technologies, why can't bad guys hire people, not you, but people like you?

However, after consolidating, SPY fell about 1.14%. After the fall, SPY consolidated for about 5 days and 17 hours from 11/18 - 11/24 (over the weekend). Spy jumped about 1.46% before the current consolidation channel.‚Äù

&#x200B;

Monday will be the start of SPY‚Äôs 4th day of consolidation, so something has to give IMO, but she could consolidate on Monday, so watch out for pump fakes. You may want to extend the consolidation channel to be safe. However, if SPY breaks out, expect a 1-2% movement in either direction, as highlighted below.

As stated in an earlier analysis, I'm bullish on SPY if it stays above 358 ish. SPY continues to toy around with a w-shaped recovery as highlighted below. On the daily chart, I'm looking for PSY to break through resistance and find new support. If support looks healthy, you could sell your wife's wedding ring and look at a late Dec. 380c. lotto.

The company I work for has had a steady stock price of between $12-$15 for most of the 6 years I've been with them. They have been in a growth phase (large international miner, so it takes years to build our expand mines, and several of their projects are coming to a head in the next year) when corona hit in March. I started buying at $7, and I bought again at $6 and again at $5 and even more at $4. I like warren buffett's advice that the stock price dropping after you buy is a good thing because now you can buy even more at a better price. Then in mid may when the price had rebounded to around $7.50, the company announced cuts and said that there could potentially be mass layoffs in the future. I sold immediately with a decent profit. I didn't want to lose my job and my investment all in one blow. Metals prices rebounded to higher than they have been in a decade and the company is doing great. The stock is at $23 now. Even if I had kept it I would have sold half at $12 and probably the rest at $15. But dang, i can't stop kicking myself because I see the price of the stock multiple times a day at work.

In recent weeks there has been a lot of interesting action in the stock market as it relates to $PSTH. Despite a lot of noise and speculation (if one were to go looking), the major news outlets and press have been quiet. This DD makes the argument (based on the available evidence) that Bill Ackman‚Äôs blank cheque company, PSTH, will announce a merger with Stripe, securing a \~10-20% position in the company and taking it public.

This can be discredited as conjecture, but most things on WSB can be and are before they are realized. There is simply too much evidence here in favor of this happening to be ignored any longer.

**Required Watching once you finish skimming this DD:** [**https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzz5SGpDrc4**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzz5SGpDrc4) **(outlines all relevant info from the man himself)**

**EDIT: The comments section of the thread is as useful as the actual DD itself. A lot of minutia in the comments that serious players should be aware of.**

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Key Information/Timeline of Events:**

\- In July 2020, Bill Ackman went live with SPAC $PSTH ‚Äì the SPAC raised $4B in proceeds with the option to take it to $7B making it the biggest SPAC ever.

\- The SPAC is designed very differently than others and incentivizes long term holding. Upon purchase of one common share and holding of that share through announcement and merger, owners receive 2/9 of a warrant with a strike of $23. Those who buy and sell on announcement bounce therefore give up that 2/9 and it goes back into the pool for those who hold through merger. What a lot of people are missing is what this means. It means that the ceiling for the value of that fractional warrant is unknown but at minimum is 2/9. If there was a minority sell off on announcement that 2/9 could increase to 3/9 or 4/9 warrant for those who stay in. This creates a wild incentive for long term holding of the company and is referenced in the "tontine" name - look it up, pretty cool.

\- Ackman has given several interviews since the listing of PSTH arguing that they are very well positioned to target and capture a unicorn (large cap, well run, asset light, family owned, high moat, company.) Early speculation included AirBnB. While Ackman held talks with the company, they didn‚Äôt get to the point where his people got an inside look at the financials and he basically said they had no idea what they were dealing with despite liking how the company looked on the outside.

\- Ackman in the same videos talked up Stripe as a quality company but one not ready to go public, specifically citing managerial deficits.

\- Stripe has been talked up by some in the press as the next Google. They control a large percentage of online payments at present.

\- Ackman has publicly disclosed his biggest misses as companies that make money based on money, giving Visa/Mastercard as the obvious example.

**- In the weeks since those interviews, several key events have taken place as follows:**

o Following Ackman comments, Stripe initiates a dramatic position filling hiring spree with focus on positions needed to go public/SPAC

o Square executive joins board of PSTH

o **Seth Klarman** ($30B hedge fund manager ‚Äúthe next Buffet‚Äù and noted value investor, disclosed a $400M position in PSTH).

o  **Guuggenheim** buys 22,000,000 $PSTH shares

o **Warren Buffet** has slashed his JPM position almost entirely potentially signifying a shift towards other financials? With online sales through the roof (this is just getting press in the last 2-3 days in earnest), he could be making a final gigantic long-term play for $BRK before he passes away). What better choice than a money maker based on money.

o Warren Buffet is secretly building a large position and hiding it from the press/pushing filing deadlines as much as possible. $BRK on record saying they want in on energy or tech giant.

o There is a large and undisclosed PSTH somewhere in the market that is not Klarman‚Äôs.

o In recent days the pre-market movement has been very odd. Several million positions. Pre-market on Friday for example, stock was up nearly **9%** for some of the morning. Has consistently hit after-market highs the next day. The data is trending in a very clear direction.

o The most cited (and really only) example of why this won't be Stripe is some troll that one of the brothers made on twitter. If they are indeed in negotiations, or getting ready to re-present to PSTH given all their new hiring, and given PSTH work in securing top of the line investors (**Klarman, Guggenheim, Blackstone, Ontario Teacher's Union**), this wouldn't be a bad negotiation tactic. They know the PSTH offer must come with some concessions.

**RE WARRANT STRUCTURE:**

"To clarify: if no public shares redeem for cash, then each share gets 2/9 distributable tontine warrants. If half of all public shares redeem for cash, then each remaining share gets 4/9 distributable tontine warrants." [https://spacalpha.com/insights/analysis-of-tontine-warrants/](https://spacalpha.com/insights/analysis-of-tontine-warrants/)

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the end, we don‚Äôt know anything for sure but the evidence here (there is more to dig up) is very compelling. Holding a stake, whether its Stripe or something else, is likely a play with limited downside and insane upside. The warrant structure (‚ÄúTontine‚Äù) alone is so appealing.

Good luck. This position, if it turns out to be Stripe, or some similar quality company, could be life-changing for those who invest enough and pick up and make the most of the warrant structure. People like Seth Klarman don't play games. You shouldn't either.

I think the latter They always make fun of us ~~traders~~ gamblers here at r/WallStreetBets, but who \*really\* has the last laugh? Is it us Chads while we eat our crayons on the way to the Lambo shop? Or are the virgin traders truly better than us?

I'm going to show you something. Something that's never been seen by human eyes, never computed by any type of algorithm, something our wive's boyfriends wouldn't even pay attention to. This is the WallStreetBets sentiment and hype detection.

I've come to the conclusion that WallStreetBets is #1 when it comes to finding trends and finding stocks. It doesn't matter if this is after-the-fact that the stock price shot up 50% in 2 days. It doesn't matter that the stock is something nobody paid attention to until finally the whole world start trading it (PLTR). What it comes down to is the fact that WSB will find literally any stock after it has already mooned. Stock up 10% for the day? WSB knows about it. Stock up 20% in the last week? WSB has already traded it. It's genius.

**Here's the kicker**. \*Most\* times after a stock has mooned once and WSB hops on the trend, the stock will go through another 1 or 2 periods of "mooning". If you are new to the industry of printing tendies, grab a tequila on the rocks and have a drink with me while I go through some sentiment on the WallStreetBets forum.

&#x200B;

I'm not even going to start with PLTR (Palantir) because that would be too obvious. Let's start with XPEV.

&#x200B;

**XPEV**

Look at this sentiment chart. The stock wasn't even mentioned a single time until some autist found an alternative EV company to gamble on after it shot up 10% in a single day.

https://preview.redd.it/un64jt1z47261.png?width=1608&format=png&auto=webp&s=311103e4373fa04790226cebe751d1d35ca9aa9b

1st wave sentiment peaked at 3% of the sub-reddit's comment volume. What happened next? The stock stayed flat for 7 days and you autists completely forgot about it. Next stop - Wave 2: Comment volume peaking at roughly 5% of all comments after the stock price went from $33 to $43 in one day. Massive spike in chatter around the ticker and the stock price continues it's meteoric climb for a whole month. You can see another 1 or 2 waves where sentiment rises after big moves in stock prices.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**CRSR**

https://preview.redd.it/0scjg83257261.png?width=1612&format=png&auto=webp&s=fbaca71ea742ea0c1431dde33304aa009c277ba8

Next up is Corsair Gaming. None of you autists even knew the stock existed 2 months ago. We can see wave 1 happened early November with small gains in the stock price. Sentiment was steady as autists everywhere were drooling over consistent gains for the first time, loving every minute of it, kind of like when you kiss your cousin for the first time. Wasn't long after we see wave 2 and 3 of the trend where the stock continues it's mission to Mars.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**LI** 

https://preview.redd.it/alxnfwz257261.png?width=1612&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c9ebd19dec396d22ad8146e8fb1732277cd10e0

Next we'll look at LI. 99% of you, including myself, don't even know what this company does. All we know is that STOCKS ONLY GO UP. The first wave happened 3 weeks ago when comment volume reached 5% of all the comments on the sub-reddit. Stock price shot up 30% in a single day. Sounds insane that the momentum would continue upward, but it has. Not only that, the stock price has gone up another 30% in the last 3 weeks.

&#x200B;

**PLTR**

https://preview.redd.it/vs5zaon357261.png?width=1630&format=png&auto=webp&s=9f6c883545d1bf1b550890d7c4ad4518dafdde02

The PLTR sentiment chart is nothing short of magnificent for a sentiment junkie like myself. Comment volume has been rising at the same rate as the stock price. On Friday roughly 50% of discussion comments mentioned the ticker PLTR. Something that you either loved or found incredibly annoying. The only other tickers to ever break the 50% comment volume barrier are Tesla and NIO.

&#x200B;

**Conclusion**

What's the next meme stock going to be? Is it GME? Do we regress back to PRPL gang? Nobody really knows, but one thing I can agree with is that wave 1 of the trend is almost always the early adopters with gorilla balls willing to risk large amounts of capital on a stock nobody's ever traded before.

My dumbed down version of US Steel (at $11) didnt seem to get into your peanut brains so here is a wall of text to fuck you up and buy US STEEL for another 300% upside

tl;dr: Buy United States Steel (NYSE: X). OTM calls from Jan to Apr 21. üöÄ  üöÄ  üöÄ 

edit: btw since you autists like short squeeze without catalysts, X is 20% shorted with a clear as fuck path to explosion. 

United States Steel (NYSE: X, $14/share) allows us to participate in a supply squeeze in the tight US Steel market, with multiple ways to win. X operates blast furnaces which are gradually losing share to nimbler, cost-efficient mini-mills. X is currently unprofitable, following covid and plant shutdown. Trading at 0.6x P/B, it is often use as a levered ‚Äì ops, financial - proxy to steel prices.

**The bet on X is predicated on a squeeze on the US steel supply.** There are two levels of supply that has been severely curtailed due to covid. First is on the metal service centres (distributor of finished steel), which has reduced steel inventory in anticipation of weak demand. Second is on the steel manufacturers (US Steel, AK Steel, ArcelorMittal, Stelco, JWS Steel), which have idled plants to trim costs. It typically takes time to repair steelworks, rehire workers and to restart a plant. What also been additionally unfortunate is that Arcelor‚Äôs Burning Harbour furnace (1-2mt of steel) had covid infections, leading to outages. Altogether, the set-up is a super tight supply chain holding a historical low 1.5 month of steel inventory (2.5 to 3 months) and no capacity.

**In face of this tightness, demand is recovering very sharply.** Americans‚Äô demand for cars are recovering, construction has picked up and industrial activity coming back online. Shipments have rose 1-5% month on month, and because supply has been unable to pick up, manufacturers must now book steel supply about 11 to 13 weeks out (vs 4-8 weeks in a normal supply environment), and most operational mills running at close to 100% capacity; merchants looking for generic steel have been unable to find any seller, according to market surveys.

**Steel prices have inflected but demand pressure is unlikely to abate.** Spot prices rose from $400 to $750 just last week, with higher futures pricing in further increase of steel prices to $760 to $800, before easing to $600 over the course of FY21. Current demand drivers are still recovering with additional legs of steel demand ‚Äì Biden‚Äôs infrastructure bill, recent import quota on Brazilian semi-finished steel and rising steel demand globally. In fact, even at $800/ton, US steel is still trading at a discount to international steel. From industry surveys, only 10% of mill players are even willing to negotiate price (vs 50-80% historically), with most sold out till Jan / Feb.

X at $3.2bn mrkt cap, $7bn EV is trading at 0.9x P/B, 3-4x EV/EBITDA with a heavily battered balance sheet. In normal times, integrated players are an easy structural short owing to oversupply and zero capital discipline in the industry. US Steel has long been an unsexy sector that is de-growth, cyclical, value-driven (which is out of favour), capital blackhole and especially struck out in times of covid. Industry utilisation is at 70% (from 54-55% pre-covid) with a constant threat from lower cost imports. Need I continue further? This is also why even when steel prices shot up post Q3, estimates for X remain flattish.

But, in face of a supply squeeze, the highest cost producer with swing capacity represents a levered bet on the upside; Every $100/ton realized price increment gives rise to +$200mm EBITDA each quarter (2mm as of Q3, total capacity 22mt, 6mt idled) and prices have already run up >$200 since 20Q3 ended, even +10% since vaccine announced. A good reference would be 2017 to 2018, when 232 Tariffs led to a panic buy amongst metal service centres, sending steel prices to +150% to $1,200/t. US Steel, in the same period, rerated from <1x P/B to >4x. **The same narrative marks X today.**

**A key risk is supply response, which will dampen the short squeeze.** Noticeably, Nucor and STLD have new capacity coming online in 21H1 and H2. Stelco and US Steel have also invested, following the windfall from 232 tariffs. However, most of these supply would come online >6 months out, which won‚Äôt be in time for the squeeze.

"Another service center source serving the automotive industry said he had received a call earlier in the week about a panicked automotive OEM. The OEM was about to shutdown an assembly plant if it could not get the less than 1,000 st of steel it needed, according to the source.

The service center source said he expected it to be an exotic, hard to find automotive grade of steel but was shocked to learn it was one of the more generic grades of steel. The OEM was unable to find it anywhere and every service center contacted was out of stock and still waiting on orders from domestic mills.

"We are forecasting now that we will run out of inventory on some jobs by mid-January. We just can't get enough to build any inventory or safety stock. We are begging and appealing constantly for more tons and the orders we do have are all late, adding more stress," said a Midwest fabricator with automotive ties."

I went back and tracked the movements of the last 10 stocks that had their lock up period end. None of them showed any significant decline on the day of the lockup ending, maybe 1-4% movements, and the bigger ones are considering that you got in at the very top and sold at the very bottom. None of them also showed any significant tendency to decline, and either continued an existing uptrend or traded sideways. 

Hence, why the fuck would I short this thing? If any of you retards knows something that I don't, do enlighten me with your autism.

I'm assuming the trigger for the pop was [AZN's phase 3 trial](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/25/business/coronavirus-vaccine-astrazeneca-oxford.html) setback, with the idea that some of AZN‚Äôs supply contracts might be up for grabs if they run into problems. Importantly, I don't think the pop was anything NVAX-specific (like a leak) because NVAX/MRNA/INO all were up in a very similar pattern/magnitude on Friday.

There might be a better entry point over the next few days and I tend to do a horrible job trying to time things so use your own judgement.

&#x200B;

I wanted to take another crack at this DD because my first post focused too much on the science at the expense of highlighting the key misconceptions about NVAX that make this a huge opportunity, even with the recent 30% run. For those who don't read version 1, I'm a research scientist with 5+ years working in vaccine R&D and am currently a biomedical PhD candidate.

&#x200B;

**tldr: I think NVAX will have a successful Phase 3 trial and will hit $200 ($12.7B market cap) sometime between January and March.**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

# DISCUSSION

**NVAX's $8B valuation has not priced-in a successful Phase 3 trial, which I think is close to a guarantee and will happen much sooner than people are expecting**

First things first - everything in this post is irrelevant if NVAX's Phase 3 results are poor and do not support emergency use authorization and global licensure. However, I think *NVAX‚Äôs Phase 3 UK trial is as close to a slam dunk as possible*. Here's why I'm so confident (refer to first [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k08ya1/dd_from_an_actual_scientist_nvax_might_not_be/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) for more details on the science):

* NVAX not only uses the same target antigen as PFE/MRNA/AZN, but it also has superior immunogenicity as evidenced by their Phase 1 data   \[[1](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2026920?query=featured_coronavirus), [2](https://www.racap.com/media/Covid-19/RACAP_COVID-19_MAP%20Updates.pdf)\]
* NVAX has best in class antibody titer data and excellent T cell responses \[[1](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2026920?query=featured_coronavirus), [2](https://www.racap.com/media/Covid-19/RACAP_COVID-19_MAP%20Updates.pdf)\]
* Observed sterilizing immunity in non-human primates despite highest viral challenge dose \[[3](https://www.novavax.com/sites/default/files/2020-11/NovavaxPresentationforACIP.pdf)\]
* Comments from NVAX head of R&D on 24Nov2020 about the release of Phase 3 UK interim data "we have actually now adjusted our expectations around unblinding (the data) because we have made fairly conservative assumptions. But now it is clear we can expect much higher efficacy"  [quote at 16:00](https://ir.novavax.com/events/event-details/piper-sandler-virtual-healthcare-conference-fireside-session). ***This is huge revelation that I think has flown under the radar.***

&#x200B;

I'll explain more about my thinking about the timing of the interim update, but the short answer is that I think we'll get the first Phase 3 interim readout in mid-December and that the results will be at least as effective as PFE/MRNA, if not a bit better. It's worth mentioning that *at this point in the trial*, the hypothesized superior performance of NVAX will most likely not be apparent (even if it's actually superior) because the 95% mark set by MRNA doesn't leave a lot of room for improvement.

I think one of the reasons that NVAX is viewed as an underdog relative to PFE/MRNA/AZN is due to a lack of awareness that data from the UK Phase 3 trial can be submitted for global licensure and [emergency use authorization](https://ir.novavax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/novavax-covid-19-vaccine-granted-fast-track-designation-us-fda). Instead, I think people assume NVAX is much further behind based on the fact that their US Phase 3 trial will start next week. Hopefully I'm right about that misunderstanding because if so, this should rocket once the interim update is made and the market starts putting the pieces together.

Before going any further talking about valuations, let me just say that yes, I‚Äôm aware that NVAX has run up 3000% YTD. However, that represents an increase in market cap of only $7.75B (note that they‚Äôve received $2B in funding). Consider that MRNA ‚Äì who has never had a vaccine even enter a [phase 3 trial](https://investors.modernatx.com/static-files/dc121fec-63eb-4794-a2fd-e0d3eadbaa6f)  ‚Äì has had a $42B market cap increase in the same period of time with $23B of that increase coming since November 2nd (note that NVAX has increased by $3.65B since November 2nd). Pretty interesting for NVAX if you ask me and supports my hypothesis that NVAX will rocket once data is released and they're viewed as being legitimate.

&#x200B;

**NVAX has supply contracts in place for at least 1.5B doses and the manufacturing capacity to deliver up to 2B doses in 2021 and will generate BILLIONS of dollars of revenue pending successful trial results**

These are the most up to date numbers that I could find but I would expect additional purchase agreements upon release of phase 3 efficacy data and/or any problems with PFE/MRNA/AZN vaccines:

* UK [agreement](https://ir.novavax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/novavax-and-uk-government-announce-collaboration-and-purchase) to purchase at least 60M doses with [analyst estimates](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/10/29/why-novavax-shares-vaulted-higher-today/) that it will bring in up to $1B in revenue
* OWS [agreement](https://ir.novavax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/novavax-announces-16-billion-funding-operation-warp-speed) for the US to provide 100M doses as part of the $1.6B in funding
* Japan [agreement](https://ir.novavax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/novavax-and-takeda-announce-collaboration-novavax-covid-19) to manufacture and provide 250M doses
* [Agreement](https://ir.novavax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/novavax-and-canada-reach-agreement-principle-acquire-novavax) with Canada to provide up to 76M doses
* [Agreement](https://www.gavi.org/news/media-room/new-collaboration-makes-further-100-million-doses-covid-19-vaccine-available-low) to provide up to 1B doses to the COVAX buying program

&#x200B;

All the talk about who gets to market first ignores the fact that the world will need billions of doses which can't be individually supplied by any one company and NVAX already has substantial supply agreements in place. Importantly, most of the agreements are contingent on clearing phase 3 trials which once again further increases the importance of the Phase 3 interim results. Also, the idea that there will be no profits in COVID vaccines is simply untrue (see MRNA‚Äôs market cap). It‚Äôs challenging to try to project revenue due to the high probability that there are new supply agreements upon release of phase 3 interim data, but even if you stick with the current slate of agreements it‚Äôs a huge number relative to an $8B market cap.

The other key assumption for NVAX to ever be able to reach the $200+ range is that their global network of manufacturing sites will actually be able to deliver on these agreements. To that end, NVAX has [agreements](https://ir.novavax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/novavax-announces-covid-19-vaccine-manufacturing-agreement-serum) with seven different contract manufacturers around the world, including an agreement with the Serum Institute of India who makes more vaccine doses annually than anyone in the world resulting in an annual production capacity of 2B doses/year, significantly more than MRNA or PFE. In addition, NVAX has a much cheaper/faster product to manufacture at scale than either of the mRNA vaccines. It goes without saying, but there's significantly less value in being first to market if you have supply constraints.

Now, you might say even if that‚Äôs all going to come to fruition in 2021, this is a one-time event and once everyone is vaccinated that revenue stream is gone. I don‚Äôt think that will be the case because COVID is going to become endemic which will probably require that we give boosters to high risk groups, globally. Which brings me to my next point for why I think a $200 price target is well within reason:

&#x200B;

**In the likely event that annual boosters are needed for a subset of the population, NVAX is uniquely positioned to take advantage of this recurring revenue stream**

Once the pandemic is over, the difficulty and cost of conducting clinical trials is going to be significantly higher. As a result, the companies that make it through Phase 3 trials this winter will probably end up being the bulk of what‚Äôs on the menu for booster shots in the future.

I think NVAX will be in a great position to be the vaccine of choice for boosting not only because I think it will have clear superior efficacy and favorable distribution/cost, but also because all of the competitors have important limitations in this context:

* AZN/JNJ‚Äôs vaccines both induce an immune response against the viral vector itself, almost certainly preventing them from being able to be used for boosting.
* PFE/MRNA are expensive and more [painful](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/23/covid-vaccine-cdc-should-warn-people-the-side-effects-from-shots-wont-be-walk-in-the-park-.html) than typical vaccines and my sense is that people aren't going to choose to them if there are alternatives available.

Another key point in favor of NVAX is that their trials have put more emphasis on enrollment of elderly and of patients with [comorbidities](https://ir.novavax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/novavax-initiates-efficacy-trial-covid-19-vaccine-south-africa), both of whom will likely be recommended to get booster shots.

&#x200B;

**NVAX successfully completed a Phase 3 trial for their influenza vaccine (NanoFlu) just before the pandemic started and may end up as the only company with a combination COVID-Flu shot for the foreseeable future**

Although everyone rightly points out that NVAX never brought a vaccine to market, they did however successfully complete a Phase 3 trial for their NanoFlu vaccine just before the pandemic started. They shifted focus to COVID but will be submitting a BLA for [NanoFlu](https://ir.novavax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/novavax-appoints-leadership-team-advance-nanoflu-through), which if approved, will compete in the multi-billion dollar global flu vaccine market with significant revenue potential.

The important point to understand is that NanoFlu uses the same platform, formulation, and adjuvant as their COVID vaccine making a combination vaccine very feasible from a manufacturing and regulatory standpoint. This could be a huge money maker and they‚Äôll now have the revenue/cash from other activities to be able to fund the development of such a vaccine. A combination COVID/Flu vaccine for the mRNA/vector platforms will be almost impossible for several reasons that will take way too long to explain, but it‚Äôs not on the radar for them. Sanofi could create a combination flu shot with their COVID vaccine but their COVID vaccine candidate uses a different adjuvant than their marketed Flu shot.

It's worth addressing the fact that prior to COVID, Novavax didn't have the greatest reputation. Although this was deserved in many ways, some of the criticism ignores the staggering costs and complexities of vaccine development. There's a reason that only a handful of companies make vaccines and they're all very well funded. In my opinion, Novavax's setbacks were not a reflection on the quality of their technology and I think they were actually turning the corner prior to COVID. Either way, whatever you think about their past, Novavax is now in an unbelievably fortunate situation flush with cash and in possession of an extremely valuable vaccine.

&#x200B;

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Catalyst timing**

NVAX‚Äôs original clinical trial protocol stated that their first interim update would be triggered once 66 events are recorded at which point the data is un-blinded and the first efficacy assessment is made. But given this new caveat from Dr. Glenn about having a peak at efficacy data sooner, my guess is that we'll get the first look at efficacy data in mid-December ([quote at 16:00](https://ir.novavax.com/events/event-details/piper-sandler-virtual-healthcare-conference-fireside-session)).

The challenge in trying to trade this interim announcement is that there will almost definitely be a couple of negative [catalysts](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2020/11/28/america-will-be-the-first-country-to-roll-out-a-covid-19-vaccine) for NVAX in December, as the FDA will meet to decide about emergency use authorization for Pfizer on December 10th and for Moderna on December 17th. For all the reasons I outlined, I think these are both immaterial to NVAX‚Äôs outlook, but the announcements could trigger an overreaction and some selling. On one hand this could create a nice buying opportunity, but that might hurt if you're holding 1DTE options. I don‚Äôt know what the right answer is here, but my thought is that the interim update will greatly outweigh any negative effects of the EUA meetings and that's how I plan to play it.

I'm here to talk to you today about Stripe.

[https://stripe.com/](https://stripe.com/)

What is Stripe you may ask?

Stripe is one of the largest private companies backed by Peter Thiel (who has provided us bountiful tendies), Elon Musk, a16z, Thrive, and Sequoia Capital. It is run by 2 Irish brothers, Patrick and John Collison (so we get 2 brains for the price of one). This year, they were ranked #1 on CNBC Disruptor list.

([https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/16/stripe-disruptor-50.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/16/stripe-disruptor-50.html)[https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/16/stripe-disruptor-50.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/16/stripe-disruptor-50.html))

So wtf does Stripe do?

Good question. Over 50% of all online transactions are processed through Stripe. So think of them like Amex, Visa, and Mastercard mixed with Shopify but without the physical card. 50% was before covid - with a record 9 billion in sales processed this weekend, their online share is probably much, much more. A few months ago they acquired Paystack in Africa - these gingers will soon have a monopoly on the online global money flow on every continent beside China. 

So how do I buy it?

Well, well, here comes in Bill Ackman with $PSTH. He has curated an extraordinary list of long term shareholders perfectly fit to take a 10% stake in Stripe at a 70b valuation. These include:

If CGC hits $500 I‚Äôll pay for the third highest comment on this post to go to the Hard Rock Cafe in Vegas for 2 weeks. _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ What was your biggest play/achievement so far this year? As we approach the end of November which was one of the best in history... I was curious to see what‚Äôs been everyone best play so far in this crazy 2020 year 

Examples: biggest loss/gain play, early entry to a stock...etc_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ GME FULL STORY   

\- In April 2019 GME brings in former president of Best buy Services named ‚ÄúGeorge Sherman‚Äù who has tremendous amount of experience in Brick & Mortar retails. George made huge changes to the company (e.g., hired a former president of Nintendo America in order to solve supply issues for Nintendo Switch during the beginning of Pandemic).

\- As a result, E-commerce revenue grew 500% YTY in Q1 2020 and 800% YTY in Q2 2020.

\- Ryan Cohen, a self-made Billionaire, who co-found Chewy .com shows interest in Gamestop and purchases 9.98% of GME shares. 

\- Ryan Cohen recognizes the booming gaming industry and realizes the goldmine that Gamestop is sitting on with strong brand and 55million + PowerUp members. 

\- Despite George Sherman‚Äôs proven success in E-comm sales, Ryan Cohen believes a more aggressive change needs to happen in order to make GameStop Great Again.

\- Ryan Cohen believes that in order to make GME Great Again, it is absolutely necessary for GameStop do the following:

1) Forgo the upcoming 2-year lease renewal on all underperforming stores

2) Non-core operations in Europe and Australia to be streamlined or sold.

3) By cutting cost with the above two methods and with the revenue generated from the biggest ever console cycle, GameStop should invest heavily on boosting E-comm sales.

(Hire proficient E-comm gurus, invest more in GME website and App, secure delivery channels that are better or at least on par with Amazon.

\- Ryan Cohen demands the company to layout the roadmap as soon as possible (\*hint\* December 8 Earnings call)

**2 possible scenarios:**

1. GameStop addresses Cohen‚Äôs letters and agrees to implement Cohen‚Äôs ideas.

2. GameStop completely disagrees with Cohen as they believe they are on the right track or doesn‚Äôt address Cohen‚Äôs letter at all.

\- Scenario 2 is where it could get interesting as many speculate a potential hostile takeover by Ryan Cohen. 

My take on this:

\- Ryan Cohen is not a WSB autist. He sees the potential short squeeze opportunity. Ryan Cohen could be holding massive amount of ITM calls which he can exercise and reduce the supply of shares significantly. This way, he could easily takeover the company with the shares his holding and possibly even ride the short squeeze with us. This would force the shorts the cover. Similar to what happened in 2008 with Volkswagen.

[https://moxreports.com/vw-infinity-squeeze/](https://moxreports.com/vw-infinity-squeeze/)

\- Or, Cohen could actually plan a hostile takeover and call up a proxy vote. This could lead to recalling shares by the company, forcing the shorts to cover and triggering the short squeeze.

Icing on the cake:

\- On 12/11/20, GameStop voluntarily pays off debt as their cash on hand deems healthy.

\- Short Squeeze will happen with enough short interest even with the most retarded stocks:

TLDR: Sell your wife and get in GME

Positions: 2,000 GME Shares_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Why is QS below Market Value? Hello autist fam,

I‚Äôm trying to do some DD before I put calls into QuantumScape (QS). Volkswagen has already funded the company to the tune of $300 million (100 first round, 200 recently). The company is supposed to be Valued at 3.3 billion per the pro evaluation of this funding.

However, why the hell is its market cap 1.06 billion? My maths is telling me it‚Äôs trading at 1/3 the evaluation assumes by VW, and I know those German retards did their DD.

Someone tell me what I‚Äôm missing.

Edit: someone pointed out that the RH market cap evaluation might not tell the full story. RH has it at 1.06 billion. However, the pro forma price is at 16 billion.

I‚Äôm thinking this has to do with the outstanding warrants, but I‚Äôm retarded so other insight is welcomed_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ [DD] MRNA is going to go up 20% by years end, almost guaranteed - that could easily be 200% if WSB piles in. This shit is waiting to PRINT. Hi everyone. Just for some background, I am a PhD candidate at a large U.S. research university. My current area of focus is pre-clinical vaccine development in animal models. Before starting my PhD, I worked on investigating endpoint vaccine responses for late-stage human clinical trial vaccines. None of that probably made any sense to you guys, but just know that I know my shit.

Here's why Moderna ($MRNA) is about to blast off to the fucking moon. I should've given this DD earlier, but this is better late than never. Most of this is known to anybody following Moderna, but you guys have been too busy chasing PLTR gains to notice the rocket about to blast off underneath your feet.

1) mRNA technology is far superior to the adenovirus vaccine used by Astrozeneca. I refer to adenovirus vaccines as BoomerVax because of how much they suck and how obsessed Boomer scientists are with trying to get them to catch on. The Ebola vaccine was probably the only virus vaccine with decent efficacy (95%), but that's based on VSV, not Ad5.

2)The reason they are so great? The mRNA itself as well as the (proprietary) delivery cage that it is injected with is self-adjuvating, meaning it kicks your immune system into overdrive and your body starts producing antibodies like a goddamn sweatshop. That's why people feel fatigued after getting mRNA vaccines, their immune system is working in overdrive. Doubt you'll see this after getting a 70% efficacy BoomerVax.

3) The only other vaccine using the mRNA technology is the Pfizer vaccine, but that needs to be stored in Ultra Low Temp (ULT) freezers which are at -80 degree Celsius (I'm not a Europoor - don't be alarmed - we just use metric in science). Most pharmacies do not have these. What do most pharmacies have or could easily get? A goddamn regular freezer which can get pretty damn close to -20 degrees Celsius (0 Fahrenheit)  Moderna's vaccine also has better name recognition and didn't magically change their efficacy from 90 to 95%. If it's easier to store, it's American, and more people will be using it.

3) Analysts, who usually suck and just want to ruin gains, are getting increasingly bullish on MRNA. [Salveen Richter](https://www.tipranks.com/analysts/salveen-richter) from Goldman Sachs just upped the price target to $139. Other analysts have also had targets as high as $160, with Piper Sandler recently coming in at $136. The average analyst rating for Palantir is at $13.50, so you idiots could easily get Moderna to blast off to $216+.

4) This vaccine is all but guaranteed to get an emergency use authorization in December. That is going to send the stock flying. If WSB autists pile in with the algos trading on good news, this thing is going to break the roof off of WSB. I have never seen a vaccine with this good of results not get approved quickly. FDA is under tremendous pressure and will issue the EUA even if there are side effects in a small number of people, because the alternative is a much larger number of people dying from COVID.

It‚Äôs up 30% in a week after being flat for 12 years. Why is this? 

Well, after the financial crisis of 08-09, the government took control of a few companies including GM, Chrysler, AIG, Merrill, Countrywide and some others.

Each of these were either sold off to more solvent company (Merrill, Countrywide, Cheysler) or eventually were resold to the public through a new IPO (GM).

Except Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FMCC).

Instead of reselling them to the public, the government kept them captive and stole their lunch money for twelve years.

How much money?

$380,000,000,000

Yes. Almost enough to buy TSLA outright.

As you might imagine, the owners of FNMA and FMCC were a bit pissed about being robbed by the government to that extent, so they sued.

These things take years to wind their way through the court system, but it just happens that this case hits December 9.

While we can‚Äôt know the outcome of the case, there are things we do know.

1. The listed defendant is Secretary of the Treasury, Steve Mnuchin. This means he can settle this out of court anyway he wants.
2. With the new 6-3 conservative majority on the court, they may not be too sympathetic to an argument the government can steal $300 billion from you.
3. FNMA has $60 billion in the bank now
4. FNMA makes 10-15 billion in profits per year
5. The entire market cap of FNMA is $3 billion 

For those wondering, there are no options on FNMA, but at a share price of $2.65, a share of FNMA or FMCC IS AN OPTION.

Note: if this doesn‚Äôt settle by the time Trump leaves office Biden will scuttle it if he can because democrats love that pot of free money.

But for the sake of diversification it doesnt hurt to look and see where there are more tendies to be had.

PG&E Has had a rough ride but it is through the fire at this point. Pun intended. So Im gonna lay out some key reasonings as to why Im bullish on PCG and you should be too.

1. They are a monopoly on power distribution in the most expensive places to live in the world.

2. Before covid they were on the rise, because of the fires they have been left behind as every other stock is back to pre covid levels. This alone should be a massive bullish case

3. Looking at the 52 week chart, **exactly one year ago PCG went on an absolutely insane bull run FROM $7 TO $18.** At some point this shit is gonna happen again.

4. Hedge funds have been loading up on it.

5. Fire season is over and they handled it perfectly, beyond that in they have an agreement with the state now where they will not be solely responsible for any fires.

6. The inevitability of dividend reinstatement and the free reign they have to bring it back. In the bankruptcy agreement they agreed to not reinstate a dividend until 6 billion in non-GAAP earnings. What the fuck is non-GAAP? That means non generally accepted accounting principles. So they could literally make up any reason at any time, as to how they earned 6 billion dollars. ‚ÄúHey guys, every dollar we earned and got a loan for is earnings even though we didnt account for ITDA.‚Äù Nerds;‚ÄùHey PGE thats not generally accepted‚Äù PGE; ‚ÄúExactly you retards, why would you let us do this‚Äù.

The last point should be the most bullish case for PCG. Dividend reinstatement is inevitable and when it happens every single boomer retirement and pension fund is going to race into this shit. Before the first fire case it had a share price of $70. Once the dividend is back this shit will have a tesla level bull run.

So dont be a üåàüêª and fucking pump this shit up because if we can get some meme-mentum behind this it will be insane.

Buy mostly LEAPS, yolo some shit on weeklys. This bitch is going to the moonüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ 410k of losses over 8 months All is in the title. It was 95% of my savings. Now I come here not to lament or anything, I have to deal with that shit on my own. My friends and wife (as of now...) have my trading account frozen anyway.

I come here to remind that losing can have consequences and what got me is the infamous but very real "I'm going to recoup my losses". At first I lost on long plays, shares, i kid you not in March i sold fsly and net at respectively 24 and 18$, approx 160k down to 120 (I bought Fastly at 32 last year).

Then I discovered options and bought monthly ATM 550c from TSLA and it visited the 400 pretty quick at that time. This got me another 40k deeper. I know today it's close to 3000 (600 post split)...

I did some good lucky moves and mostly made it all back in the summer, but then decided for whatever reason to bet on Intel, with hindsight because there was a a series of good chip manufacturers earnings and I was on a positive streak... They did -20% the fuckers and that's when things started getting fun. I got margin called so I wired intraday more funds, it was Friday, they were immediately available and in my panic I discovered 0DTE, those funds got fucked as Intel didn't rally back much.

0DTE was the beginning of the downward spiral that transformed a 160k loss into a 410k loss, week after week, by chunks of 25k i kept wiring to reload my day trading limit. This is basically when you MUST find the strength to stop. I kept dreaming about more multipliers "I can do x3, x5 or x10 with a good 1pm qqq buy that will end up with a hulk dildo by 4pm". This my friends is typically the exact reason your brain will defeat all your rules, your checks and you might even start lying just because you think its possible to make it back.

I've lost everything, I don't own any property, my parents are poor and not from the US, I'm actually homeless right now but I have a good paying job in a Bay Area company. The morale of the story is that it's all fun and games if you play and stick to a small % of your savings and ABSOLUTELY don't refund your account if you take losses, denial is a stronger force than you think, and addiction to day trades is very real. I repeat, addiction is very real especially with the gamification of most trading apps (webull, robinhood, power etrade). Anyhow, I will carry over my big loss for years while my wife is going to use my savings and buy regular SPY so we can at least offset the possible gains in 10-15 yrs...

&#x200B;

Don't be the next me.

\[EDIT\] I can't post the chart atm, besides ETrade app really sucks and Webull might be somewhere still but its really painful to open those apps..

\[EDIT2\] I know next weeks will see SPY and QQQ skyrocket with speculation on PLTR and shit exploding. But that was already the reason i kept chasing in September before the drop, the reason I chased this summer and before. There always will be money to be made on the market, but its more of a guarantee when its just shares and you hold them. I know this is straight /r/investing shit. I guess losing my saving account in my 30s made me enough of a loser to reconsider my choices.

\[EDIT3\] I'm going to go to therapy, yes.

\[EDIT4\] When you lose you might start making excuses like "if i didn't have to pay my student debt" or "if i didn't need to make enough money for a downpayment" you think you wouldn't have traded that risky. But it's all on you, it's all your responsibility and you stayed because you managed to make those lucky moves that actually printed and you hoped you could do it again.

Mckesson, pumped by our dear friend Cramer about a week and half ago, only to crash the following day on news that amazon is entering the pharmacy space. Mckesson has market cap close to 30B, and a forward P/E of 10. If we wanna make some tendies, we gotta move on from the Pfizer/bntx/Moderna and other vaccine plays. Who wins the vaccine race? Who cares, Mckesson is the winner as it is the largest of the 3 distributors who have a monopoly on the markets and selected as the main partner in operation warp speed. Mckesson has annual revenue of roughly 200B, and margins are razor thin. Margins are so thin, there is no more meat on the bone for Amazon to chew off. Regardless this is a short term play so no need to delve into competition, opiate settlements, and risks. The play here is vaccine rollout week which should be ~3 weeks out. With a vaccine imminent, and the general consensus that an effective vaccine is found, the challenge now is logistics. As more media is focused on logistical issues of distribution, more attention will be focused on Mckesson. Mckesson has only received negative press for the last couple years with the opiate crisis, some positive news should right the ship, and I think we could push to 195-200 share. We have bounced nicely from the Amazon competition sell off, and should look to push higher over the next few weeks. I own stock, but will be looking to buy 195 call monthlies on Monday.

Hop on the $SFT happy train REIT-ards ! _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Possible Overstock Short Dive on Monday, ex-CEO is wilding So the former CEO of Overstock, Patrick Byrne, is talking about some wild shit again.
https://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2020/11/28/former-overstockcom-ceo/
Why is this important? Well, last year when he did this, it made the stock fall and actually got him fired as CEO. So although he's no longer officially connected with the company, people associated the brand with him. I think Overstock might experience a short dive due to this on Monday, which would interrupt the great climb its been having lately. However, once people realize he is no longer really with the company, and when Overstock puts out a statement distancing themselves from him, I expect them to rebound.

So if any of this actually happens, buy a put 12/4, sell it before the afternoon is up, and then get a call for the rebound.

Update: As I was typing this, Overstock put out this tweet distancing themselves https://twitter.com/Overstock/status/1332850118480060416?s=20_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ If PLTR hits $40 in the next 2 weeks, I'm leaving the girlfriend I live with. There's really nothing more to say. I haven't been happy in my 1 year-relationship. My girlfriend probably moved in with me with the expectation that I'll **pay her $40k Nursing School debt THAT SHE NEVER EVEN GRADUATED FROM (and she never told me about this debt**)**.** She was working as a receptionist but quit when we moved in because of 'mental health issues'.

Honestly I've taken her to a psychologist, cared for her, even took some leave just to spend time with her and help her recover. I give her alone time when she asks for it. And when I'm at home, I always do the chores and ask her if she's game to go eat something nice and spend more time together.

One day, I pull up to our condo and my door is open. I see some other *fucking guy* leaving my house, and he looks like he's been on a million different drugs.

Pissed, I ask her about it and she gets angry at me, asking me why I'm never home and why I always abuse her. She dodges the question over and over and says that it's just 'a friend' she opened the door to because no one was home to keep her company. This happens about 2 more times and one day, I confront the guy in the front door and turns out he's '**rented**'.

First off. Where did she get the money? Has she been renting guys out with the little "salary" I'm giving her to spend while I'm working my ass off  providing for both of us? I'm a freaking security guard earning $19 CAD/hr. Which is not bad but not sustainable for a relationship where one person pays for two.

I was pissed to hell.

There was something she didn't know about, though. I've been stashing away a little bit of money, starting with 5K CAD after finding about this reddit site. At that time, I was honestly depressed because I had a hard time paying for our condo and with debt. And perhaps that fueled me with all-inning that 5K with a PLTR options play (call) that expired Nov 27, 2020. Oct 30, 2020 when I bought multiple calls for PLTR it rockets all the way to **wakanda** and to **jupiter**. I'm now 1012% up. I cash out before Citron shorts it. **(DW I'll add that money to buying PLTR STOCKS**, less riskier than doing options).

***How does this relate to my girlfriend?***

It relates. It relates because I'm going to leave her fucking ass. Actually, even if PLTR doesn't hit $40 I'm STILL going to leave her ass. I have to pay spousal support, because of our cohabitation agreement, but when I looked at the calculator online, it amounts to about $82 per month for **0.5** to **1 year**. I'll do it and then cut all ties. And that bitch'll have to handle her debt herself. I'll cut all ties and leave without a fuckin word.

It's not like we are obligated to one another. I haven't committed to her through marriage. And this is my decision.

So her, that 'rental' guy, Jim Cramer, and CITRON can go suck my hard, throbbing cock because PLTR is making 50k liters of blood gush into it every time it goes up.

Solidium is more and more bullish on $NOK for unclear reasons. The latest update on November 25, 2020 shows Solidium holds 292M shares (5.2%) at an average of 3,42 euros for a total of 997M euros. It held 283M shares (5.01%) on September 3, 2020. Prior to that, it held only 3.7% in January 2020.

I stole this from some dude on /Rinvesting_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Why GME will survive and prosper Many of you are questioning why there is so much hype behind GME, so let me drop just a small info bomb for the uninformed autists. Obviously everyone is tracking a possibility of a short squeeze, which is just one small part of the overall picture. 

- "In a seemingly unprecedented deal, GameStop will now share in the lifetime digital sales revenue‚Äîincluding for full game downloads, DLC, and subscription plans‚Äîfor any Xbox console sold through its stores. How much that arrangement will impact the bottom line for the struggling retailer is still an open and heavily debated question, though."

In exchange for this revenue, 

- "According to a press release issued by both companies, GameStop will now rely on Dynamics 365 to power its "back-end and in-store solutions." "This will enable store associates the ability to access omni-channel insights about customer preferences and purchasing history, real time information on product availability, subscriptions, pricing, and promotions in order to provide a differentiated and personalized in-store customer experience," GameStop says."

Obviously my opinion is simply speculation, but all of this on top of Ryan Cohen (a billionaire investor with an almost 10% stake in gamestop) pushing the CEO board of Gamestop to conduct a strategic review to revise the way Gamestop operates in an increasingly digital world of gaming, on top of a possible short squeeze, will lead shares of Gamestop to the moon.

We should see some coverings next week, out of both fear going into earnings and just out of how much some of them will be losing. These last few moves have been mainly big buying rather than coverings, but that doesn‚Äôt matter too much. Technicals are pretty strong right now also. I personally think next week could be great, with a string of 10% days or around that, with some shorts covering. I think we could hit low 20‚Äôs next week, then Monday and Tuesday some profit taking before earnings and some more shorting since earnings are anticipated to be bad, like the recent GME earnings. Should have a nice dip right after ER, then from then on it‚Äôs all unprecedented. Cohen could buy GME on that dip, depending his plan, how much we dip, if we dip at all, and if he has funding to buy GME anyway. Vaccine approval should bump us a little as well, since GME is still seen as B&amp;M. I will be buying weekly 20c‚Äôs at open, but only becuase I‚Äôm very confident we go up a good amount next week, don‚Äôt do what I‚Äôm doing, IV and theta will probably hurt pretty bad.
