 Maybe algos are to blame for recent volatility? Im under the impression that algo trading is causing the dips and spikes in trading. 

First, some context for those who dont know: algorithmic trading is essentially trading done by computers and algorithms. Some of these algorithms use data such as Google search trends to figure out which stocks to trade. This has had mixed results, a good example being [the false report of united airlines filing for bankruptcy](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB122100794359017593) and the ensuing crash of UAL stock afterwards. 

So Think about it: when the news originally hit that there was a short squeeze there was practically no speculation and mostly focused on the stocks rise. Afterwards the media started putting out all sorts of info about the situation. And I can only imagine what people started searching for related to the story. All of these searches that hint toward speculation were probably used by algorithms to predict wether it will rise or fall. At 1pm on Monday this week market watch reported that the short sellers closed out more than half of their positions. Im not able to find this article Due to the way marketwatch works and how they constantly update their articles and change the headlines but I feel that stories of that nature started circulating right around market close. Thats when the dip started to happen. The algorithms basically became noise traders who take up on irrelevant news and front run orders before anyone else can act on it.

Also, I think that it explains the silver price debacle. I imagine that alot of older people or those who lean more towards investing in metals and things like that started picking up on the news about game stop and started googling the price of silver. With all of this sudden interest in search terms revolving around silver, the algos probably saw that as a good signal to start trading silver, which lead to price spikes, which ended up front running orders for silver before anyone even knew that it was becoming more popular. Then it just snowballs as news stories start picking up on it and reporting the news that its going up which started driving the price up even further. Afterwards they start saying that *a certain subreddit* denies any push on silver prices which then leads to negative speculation on price, Leading to a drop in price.

TL:DR I think that hype isnt only limited to people but also applies to algorithms looking at search terms. Do what you want with that knowledge, but its honestly insane that its even a thing. One fake news story can go viral and can cause a stock to crash or skyrocket to unbelievable levels because of HFT, like we have already seen with UAL and gme, and probably with the flash crash in '10.

Position: nothing invested atm. Simply observing._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Why would you sell a put (covered) at a strike that is much higher than the actual price of the stock? When I look at stocks and their available options, I get confused by the extremely high strike prices for puts, when compared to the stock itself. 

If I have 100 shares in a company, and the share was $5 each, and decided to sell a put at a $20 strike price, what happens come expiration date?

If this person who bought the put decides to exercise the option, does that mean I just hand over my 100 shares? Or do I have to buy 100 more shares priced at $20, even though the value is only $5, and then I’m out all that extra money? And what if they decide *not* to exercise? I just keep the premium and my 100 shares, right? And if that’s the case, why the heck would anyone buy that extreme strike in the first place?

corsair has just announched about closing on public offering by selling insiders shares( of their highest owners -EagleTree which reduced ownership from 78% to 68%)  8,625,000 shares 35$ per share with 30-day option to buy another 1.13M shares.

in addition to that some of the executives of the company sold sold shares at 35$ which can be expected because it is the first time they cashed since the IPO.

**RISKS:**

* there's a risk associated with corsair bussiness which is they depend on third-party computer hardware, particularly graphic cards and CPUs, and video games. - if any of the above will see a decline  it may hard crsr business. - every year there's new GPUs, CPUs and video games, and corsair will be there to provide their equiment ! i dont see this bussiness declining soon, quite the ooposite - when people will get back to work they will have new money to spend on their PCs and game consoles, and dont forget about new stimulues.
* if eSports wont continue growing at the current rate and according to the excepted growth - there will be harm to sales.

&#x200B;

POSITIVE:

* gaming and creator becoming pupolar and keep rising at the moment.(not due to covid)
* part of corsair products are used for "3 letters forbidden word" mining.(GPUs and Power supplies)
* alot of rgb product that attracts young audience.
* variaty of products to all costumers (20$-1000$+)
* still and young company with a very promising future ahead !
* covid lockdowns made alot of people more aware to computers and gaming
* Alot of influencers marketing corsair.

i think that corsair is perfectly positioned to continue growing, at the current rate they are a value play at a steal price. streamers and youtubers marketing corsair products and as a result corsair can expect to keep their growth in sales. they can generate billions each year in the up coming years and i really think they are under valued right now.

combine that with the crazy time we live in, shortage all over the world for GPUs, CPUs and gaming consoles - the demand is crazy and corsair will benefit as well.

at 21, jan corsair just filed [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1743759/000119312521011458/d32212ds1.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1743759/000119312521011458/d32212ds1.htm) because of their latest "offering".

why do we care about that ? thanks to some guys from r\\investing i found that that apparently their next earning are already out and nobody talking about that.

**For the year ended December 31, 2020, we expect:**

**• Net revenue to be between approximately $1,700 million and $1,701 million**

**• Net income to be between approximately $101 million and $103 million**

**• Adjusted EBITDA to be between approximately $211 and $213 million**

Yes, we already know they have beaten their own updated estimates…

In fact, the company initially estimated the following (*from Q3 release* [https://ir.corsair.com/static-files/9eeb96ec-6c9b-47f6-a7e5-6c9f0312b50d](https://ir.corsair.com/static-files/9eeb96ec-6c9b-47f6-a7e5-6c9f0312b50d))

For the full year 2020, we currently expect:

• Net revenue to be in the range of $1,616 million to $1,631 million.

• Adjusted operating income to be in the range of $178 million to $184 million.

• Adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $187 million to $193 million.

Then, they updated the *guidance on November 30th 2020* ([https://ir.corsair.com/news-releases/news-release-details/corsair-gaming-updates-full-year-2020-outlook](https://ir.corsair.com/news-releases/news-release-details/corsair-gaming-updates-full-year-2020-outlook)):

For the full year 2020, we currently expect:

* Net revenue to be in the range of $1,651 million to $1,666 million.
* Adjusted operating income to be in the range of $186 million to $192 million.
* Adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $194 million to $200 million.

**So they have beaten their own initial and revisited estimates. Great!! Really great!!**

**2)** But that’s not all we can easily infer from the Prospectus dated January 21, 2021 (Again… we just need to look).

As they mention on the Q3 report, “as of September 30, 2020, we had cash and restricted cash of $120.1 million, $48.0 million capacity under our revolving credit facility and total long-term debt of $370.1 million”.

In the more recent prospectus (page 10):

*In addition to the foregoing, as of December 31, 2020, we expect to have approximately $133 million in cash and restricted cash and we expect to have net debt of approximately $194 million following the repayment of $50.0 million in existing debt with cash on hand during the quarter ended December 31, 2020.*

**This means that they have reduced net debt from $250M ($370 - $120 of cash) to $194M, which implies $56M of free cash flow generated during the quarter.** As a reminder, they generated around 21M FCF in q3 2020 and 94M in the first 9 months of 2020. So **this implies around 150M FCF in 2020** (as a reference in the first 9 months of 2019, they had negative FCF of about 6M).

(check cash flow statement at page 14 on the Q3 report here [https://ir.corsair.com/static-files/9eeb96ec-6c9b-47f6-a7e5-6c9f0312b50d](https://ir.corsair.com/static-files/9eeb96ec-6c9b-47f6-a7e5-6c9f0312b50d))

And about their operation statement which looks pretty promising, this is how a growth stock looks, i see a bright future for them.

Hims & Hers HIMS is emerging as a player in the telehealth space, catered to millennials. Not only do they sell erectile dysfunction 🍆 medications and birth control, but they are in the telehealth space. They cater to younger and presumably healthier people and offer health consultations that are more like primary care. 

I looked on the website and the telehealth seems to be a big component and I believe that this will become an emerging trend because most younger 20-40yo people don't really need to visit a provider/doc/np/pa but yearly. The older/sicker obviously don't apply here BUT the market for this type of shift in primary care is gargantuan. Tens of millions of 20-40ish. I work in healthcare and I assure you, most young patients don't need a physical examination and most of the time when I go for my annual visit, I don't get one. You just need a good camera and microphone. Telehealth is easy for young folks too and if labs or other tests are needed they can be referred. 

I imagine that this can replace the doctors visit for millennials and that is why I am so bullish. I am also bullish on ONEM and TDOC as well.

I don't know much about their financials, but their revenue has grown substantially, I can't see subscriber trends, but TBH I don't care because I see the shift to telehealth daily. Also, THEY DONT DEAL WITH INSURANCE OR MEDICAID.  We don't have enough doctors in the US to care for the aging population, and tech is going to accelerate this change. I foresee that happy subscribers would stick with HIMS, I don't know the retention rate though FWIW.

Unfortunately, I was sitting on this one because I thought it was just boner pills, so that's why I shared, because I learned that it isn't.

I'm new to investment and so please tell me if there is some flaws in my logic here and if my assumptions doesn't add up

Currently I've decided to start researching holiday/travelling market as I expect (I know its very optimistic) Covid to start easing off by the end of the year and so naturally travelling and holiday sectors should bounce back.

Accor Hotels caught my eye with surprisingly low share price currently. I think I must be missing something. Ok, so corona happened and of course the hotel chains got hit hard. Fair enough, their financial report for 2020 looks dreadful.

However, I've looked at their previous financial reports and I've seen a stable growth pattern. From 2018 to 2019 their revenue jumped by almost 15%. I'd say that is really impressive. In addition to that, before corona in 2019 they've started expanding their portfolio and diversifying which I thought was a great move.

Now, talking about share price, Accor currently sits at 29euros in the Paris stock exchange which is roughly $35 a share. Now, in comparison, in 2019 Starwood (which was acquired by Marriot recently) traded at almost $90 a share when in reality they are smaller than Accor and doesn't boast the same capital and assets as Accor does. Before corona, Accor's share price was floating around 40euros.

Am I right to assume they are undervalued and there is money to be made here long term or is it just because they are not floating on New York Stock Exchange and thus doesn't have the same potential demand for shares as an American chain like Starwood was?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Thoughts on Amazon Target Prices and Altria’s Future?

XPENG (February 2021) I wanted to make an analysis on the difference between these 2 EV Chinese Car Makers: Li Auto (LI) and Xpeng (XPEV) as i also posted in Li Auto subreddit r/liautoinvestors

Many of you could think that Xpeng represents a way much better investment than LI because of its stock price, capitalization, advertising, opinions of people or general sentiment, but actually i think the reality is the opposite.

I am an investor who rely its investments more on fundamental rather than sentiment or marketing aspects of a company and I think that numbers have always the priority.

If we go taking a look to the financial statements of **Q3 2020** we can find interesting insights.

**XPENG:**

founded in 2014, listed in NYSE on August 2020.

Vehicles: 2 (G3 and P7)

Q3 2020 Deliveries: 8578 vehicles (+265% from Q3 2019)

Q3 2020 Revenue: US$293.1 million (+342,5% from Q3 2019)

**Q3 2020 Net Loss: US$169.2 million (+$50.0 million loss more than Q3 2019 (was US$120.1 million)**

We can clearly see how the main negative point for Xpeng in its financials is its net loss that is quickly deteriorating and in my opinion it's not gonna be profitable in the short term.

**LI AUTO:**

founded in 2015, listed in NYSE in July 2020.

Vehicles: 1 (Li ONE)

Q3 2020 Deliveries: 8660 vehicles

Q3 2020 Revenue: US$363.0 million

**Q3 Net Loss: US$15.7 million**

Li Auto is way much better and solid than its competitor Xpeng in terms of financial statements. The most impressive aspect is given by the fact that Li will be probably becoming profitable already in the next few quarters of 2021.

I think now the stock market is really hyped (pushed by Youtube, Reddit, and also Covid) that caused an explosion of interest in many stocks and in particular in the EV sector (see Nio, Xpeng) and this period will come to an end soon so that would be possible to go back to a fair market in which data and numbers control the market and set the stock price.

This is only my personal opinion about Li Auto, based on data, as investor who i am and as i posted in r/liautoinvestors_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ After hours trading How does a market order work with after hours trading?

For   a couple of months, I have been looking into what is a hot investment   so to speak and I couldn't believe my eyes. People are chugging ICLN  and  whatever Cathie Woods puts out without even a flinch of thought  that it  may not be the best time to purchase certain securities.

We   have genomics ETF. It holds great companies and some have a bright   future and a lot of potentials but those companies are driven up like   crazy and people are constantly buying at whatever levels they are   priced. It is not good. ETF's made it easy to believe that you cannot   really lose a lot of money because you have a lot of different   securities under one name - WRONG.

I   was sold the same idea with certain ETFs around gold and I quickly   found out that holding ETF's below 40-50K dollars is not efficient. You   pay some fees, you pay some taxes and you have almost zero control. I   like only those that follow indexes automatically and only these have   some reasoning.

Why would you   purchase something priced at 100$ without underlying balance sheets to   support this type of price? It is beyond me.

BYND   is a perfect example too. I know I know, we have Biden and many people   are excited about billions going into the green energy sector but   remember this - government contract doesn't guarantee retail success. We   have to think about these companies like other normal businesses and  if  you are buying a 110$ stock based on a sausage they might produce  later  this and sell it 4-5 years down the road - you are making a  mistake.  This is not investing - this is buying on the premise that the  company  will do insanely well - the sad truth is if you were to spend  45 minutes  of your life on youtube looking at reviews from burger  channels people  that are chugging meat all day long are cringing while  eating their  plant-based burger. "Yeah it's fine, I like the idea but  it is not  tasty" - people are not coming back to pay 30% more money for  a burger  that tastes worse than a cow. I am sorry but this is just  reality.  Especially in an economy where people are out of a job, need  to cut  costs.

People forgot how  to  INVEST. This is the keyword. People (not all of you) started  speculating  and when I see another ETF made on whatever is the new hot  thing it  makes me cringe.

One guy  asks if  he should invest in a newly created ETF on the water! Do your  DD and if  companies under that ETF are not printing money - DON'T.  Another user  replied with a great answer - if we have a national/global  water problem  distribution will be held on a government level probably  controlled by  the army, not by a few capitalists, OP immediately  changed his narration  because he didn't take that possibility into the  equation.

People  like Cathie Wood  need to make money for their companies and it is 100%  understandable.  She is looking for new ways of making money and if  something fails - it  fails. These people have hundred of billions of  dollars under control  and all it takes as we see is a couple of phone  calls to turn tables  around if something goes south. DO NOT INVEST YOUR  FIRST 10K INTO A  RANDOM ETF MADE BY A RANDOM PERSON TELLING YOU THAT  THIS IS THE FUTURE.  You will most likely lose money.

I   am afraid ETFs made it easier to lure people into these financial   assets just like bad debt was bundled and sold across Wallstreet in   2007/2008. I may be wrong, I may be a boomer but I am not touching any   active managed ETF's at this moment.

Let me rant about green a little more.

How   on earth are you thinking that a bunch of startups under ICLN will  pump  billions upon billions each year? The big dirty oil industry may  be  destroying our planet but managers of these companies have trillions  in  assets that can be spent overnight to create networks of green  energy  hubs across the globe. If you look at the investor relations tab  with  British Petroleum or Energy Product Partners (EPD) first company   suggests it wants to go carbon-free but when it will be profitable and   widely implemented - in 2050. Do you want to wait 29 years for your   investments to profit? This is capitalism, not a charity created by   Wallstreet. Some small companies may succeed in their missions on some   grounds, selling/leasing green technology or components but the big dogs   are going to pull the triggers on how and when things are going to be   done. They are not going out of business, that knife is not falling.   There is a great discussion about geography, only 17% of populated areas   in the world are good for implementing green energy (taking financial   situation and weather into account). Many many many poor countries are   not having a dime for it. It is nice to think about buying 40k$ solar   panels on your 400m2 house roof while we have a shortage of water in   India, shortage of food, and political instability in many African   countries ruled by corrupt governments that are not going to spend   billions of $ to make the world a better place. There is an argument for   the green but it is still too very early to even think about switching   from oil. I am not saying that because I am invested in oil. I hold  both  sides but majority of energy is still in that is good today and  will be  15 years down the line. Think beyond your  area/country/continent. There  is a great TEDex speech about ignorant  people that are not recognizing  world problems beyond their rich  neighborhood and I suggest every  investor - watch it. I am buying  companies that are trying to make oil a  little better because it will  be widely used in production and  consumption after we are going to see  more carbon regulations. Companies  and countries are going to seek  cleaner oil - not a solar panel. $$$  speaks $$$

In  EU countries pledged  to remove coal sometime between 2030-2050. Think  about that. Coal is  still so big it can't be replaced in 5 years. Oh  well, guess in which  sector cheap coal bites in.

If   investors were to really shape the planet we would be out of oil 40   years ago and Nestle would be long gone alongside KO and every major   bank involved in Panama Papers and 2008 would be replaced by some   fintech. Oh didn't happen.

I wish you all a lot of luck and invest wisely.

Cheers_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ "IPO pop" underway: EV charging tech provider EVBox Group Recap: [Don't be afraid of the "future tech" gold rush, including EV startups](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/kyoogq/dont_be_afraid_of_the_future_tech_gold_rush/)

Also: [Making Money in Best Reverse Mergers (and Cramer video)](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/jwu6sh/making_money_in_best_reverse_mergers_and_cramer/)

2020 saw the momentum-based realization of a few blockbuster event-level "IPO pops": Nikola (NKLA), Hyliion (HYLN), Velodyne Lidar (VLDR), Lordstown Motors (RIDE), and ChargePoint (future CHPT).  Capstoning these was the unprecedented hype of QuantumScape (QS).

Jim Cramer's statement of "maybe make some money" was an understatement, as common shares, warrants, and options each provide money-making opportunities that surpassed what can be found in a traditional IPO pop, including Snowflake's!

Options trading on these particular "IPO pops" has the potential for gains rivalling historical IPO pop gains such as the 195% of nCino (NCNO) and the dot-com record 698% of VA Linux.

2021 already saw the realization of at least two more such "IPO pops": Stem Inc. (future STEM) and Lion Electric (future LEV).

Despite all these blockbuster event-level "IPO pops," only one so far has reached $50 and beyond ($58.66) before changing to the operating company's ticker.  [This is none other than Hyliion (HYLN)](https://www.wsj.com/articles/no-revenue-no-problem-wall-street-rushes-into-electric-car-and-truck-startups-11603286077):

> [Blake Denton] learned about Hyliion, which plans to mass produce electric drivetrains for semi-trucks, while looking through posts on the online message board Reddit. The company announced a deal to go public in June by merging with a [reverse merger company] and buzz began to grow online, with some thinking it could be the next Nikola.

> “I had invested in Hyliion on pure hype—literally pure hype,” Mr. Denton said. “I knew nothing about the company.”

> He said he sold after the price went up and made about $50,000.

Momentum trading during late last year, and also during the early part of this year, showed that the rest of 2021 has the potential to change all that and add more tickers.

One of these with the potential to break $50 in the very near term is none other than [EV charging technology provider EVBox Group (future EVB)](https://news.evbox.com/en-WW/about/).

Jim Cramer discussed this play and favored it more than even ChargePoint.

*Disclosure: Long on the future EVB.*_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ AMMO INC($POWW) - DD - Researched for you so you can Decide - Updated This'll be an updated version of my previous DD, I've answered some questions, done some more research and think these additional information should be added for yall to make a more informed decisions.

First of all, There has been a shortage of ammunition for quite a while now (half a year or more) so this is not something new. There are several company out there and most if not all of their online ammunitions are all out of stock as seen in the link below:

([https://ammoinc.com/product-category/product-family/ammo-inc-signature-ammunition/](https://ammoinc.com/product-category/product-family/ammo-inc-signature-ammunition/))

I will be focused on **Ammo Inc ($POWW)** and will provide the positives and negatives of the company and others (I will update these also based on questions and input from others).

# POSITIVE Thoughts

* Positive note on the upcoming earnings, expecting a  272% growth year over year.
* Increase in demand and popularity of its one of a kind specialty ammunition (STREAK Visual Ammunition) catered to military and law enforcement.
* Increase in not just domestic contract but foreign contract.
* One of the only company that owns a brass casing division where they can sell brass ammunition components for additional revenue.
* Constructing new plants which is always a good sign of demand and growth
* Increase in gun ownership grew more than 5 million in 2020.

# NEGATIVE Thoughts

* Democratic government means gun control, they will try to pass regulation to tax gun/ammunition
* High demand, ammo companies not being able to keep up with the order. Strictly bound by lack of components (primer, brass, etc...) from third party.
* Gain might already be priced in.

More details on the Positive thoughts below:

# 1. Positive note on the upcoming earnings

The company expects to achieve revenues of $55.0 million during fiscal 2021. Revenue in fiscal 2020 was $20.2 million which would represent 272% growth year over year. :

([https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/11/18/2129167/0/en/AMMO-Inc-Updates-Guidance-for-Fiscal-Year-2021-to-55-million-Reflecting-Projected-272-Year-Over-Year-Revenue-Growth.html](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/11/18/2129167/0/en/AMMO-Inc-Updates-Guidance-for-Fiscal-Year-2021-to-55-million-Reflecting-Projected-272-Year-Over-Year-Revenue-Growth.html))

AMMO anticipates reporting in excess of $16.5 million in revenue for the third quarter of the Company’s 2021 fiscal year during the February 16th earnings conference call.  Approximately 500% Year-Over-Year Revenue Increase.

([https://ammoinc.com/2021/01/26/ammo-inc-schedules-february-16-2021-earnings-conference-call-expects-to-report-third-quarter-fiscal-results-in-excess-of-16-5-million/](https://ammoinc.com/2021/01/26/ammo-inc-schedules-february-16-2021-earnings-conference-call-expects-to-report-third-quarter-fiscal-results-in-excess-of-16-5-million/))

# 2. Specialty ammunition

Their STREAK Visual Ammunition, tracer rounds *allow the military and police the ability to view their rounds' flight path* which can help you more easily spot impacts as well as missed shots, is increased in demand and popularity among the military and law enforcement. Additionally, STREAK ammunitions are non-incendiary and do not generate heat, so they're safe to use in places where many tracers have been prohibited.

There's more to it but you can read and do research from the link below:

([https://ammoinc.com/product-category/product-family/streak-ammunition/](https://ammoinc.com/product-category/product-family/streak-ammunition/))

Basically, these patented ammunition from Ammo Inc gives them a competitive edge against the conservative companies.

# 3. Foreign contracts

One of the few companies that contracts ammunitions overseas, many of which are foreign law enforcement agencies, and has been doing so consistently year over year as shown below:

([https://ammoinc.com/2021/01/14/ammo-inc-enters-into-a-significant-import-export-transaction-for-7-62mm-ammunition/](https://ammoinc.com/2021/01/14/ammo-inc-enters-into-a-significant-import-export-transaction-for-7-62mm-ammunition/))

# 4. Owns a Brass Casing Division (JMC)

Jagemann Munition Company (JMC), formerly known as Jagemann Stamping Company, is the brass casing division of Ammo Inc. They targeted the brass casing division in 2018 and closed the transaction in early 2019 for $27 million, rebranding the operations as Jagemann Munition Components (JMC). It has a reputation dating decades as being the best in class brass supplier to the ammunition and munitions industry.

([https://ammoinc.com/product-category/product-family/jmc-brass-product-family/](https://ammoinc.com/product-category/product-family/jmc-brass-product-family/))

# 5. Constructing new plant

The  facility will support the Company’s plan to exponentially expand its manufacturing base of operations in the US and the increase of demand from over seas.

([https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/01/05/2153664/0/en/AMMO-Inc-Announces-Plans-to-Construct-a-12-Million-Plant-Tripling-its-Manufacturing-Footprint-in-Wisconsin.html](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/01/05/2153664/0/en/AMMO-Inc-Announces-Plans-to-Construct-a-12-Million-Plant-Tripling-its-Manufacturing-Footprint-in-Wisconsin.html))

# 6. Increase in gun ownership

First time gun owner grew 5 million in 2020. Does not mean a continuous demand of ammunition but definitely is a plus for the industry:

([https://www.nssf.org/first-time-gun-buyers-grow-to-nearly-5-million-in-2020/#:\~:text=NEWTOWN%2C%20Conn.-,%E2%80%93%20NSSF%C2%AE%2C%20the%20trade%20association%20for%20the%20firearm%20industry%2C,very%20first%20time%20in%202020](https://www.nssf.org/first-time-gun-buyers-grow-to-nearly-5-million-in-2020/#:~:text=NEWTOWN%2C%20Conn.-,%E2%80%93%20NSSF%C2%AE%2C%20the%20trade%20association%20for%20the%20firearm%20industry%2C,very%20first%20time%20in%202020).)

Last weekend I created a [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/l8rhr3/weekend_gme_thread_homework_for_all_lets_stop/?), in which I documented which brokers stopped people from purchasing specific securities, and which ones didn't.

Before it gets forgotten, I want to bring that list back again, and insist that you get a new broker if yours is one of the bad ones.

This is a much, MUCH bigger issue than you think, and this can and WILL affect you eventually, if you stay with a broker that decides that you cannot trade a security that they don't want you to trade. Note that the securities affected were not just meme stocks, several large stocks some of you might own or have heard about were restricted and their price was thus manipulated, including:

- General Motors
- Rolls Royce
- Trivago
- Workhorse Group
- Jaguar Health

And [many more](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/robinhood-expands-trading-restrictions-50-225241993.html).

When boomer stocks get affected, this means the entire free market is at risk and the next time this happens you might be the one unable to trade your favorite stock if you continue using a bad discount broker. 

**Whether this is the broker's fault or their clearinghouse's fault is irrelevant, the result is your inability to engage in the free market.** This behavior needs to be punished to ensure other brokers don't start doing the same thing.

Here is my list of brokers which I will continue to update, as per the [previous thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/l8rhr3/weekend_gme_thread_homework_for_all_lets_stop/?):

Thanks_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ 19 y/o college boy looking for advice So I’ve recently gotten into stocks and have been reading up on the basics for the past couple weeks and have decided to give up individual stock day trading and want to put some money into a promising ETF.

So after some browsing and research it seems to me that ICLN and ARKG are highly regarded ( at least in this sub). I can definitely put 1-2k in them and be financially okay but putting out more than around 200 dollars gives me anxiety considering this is relatively new to me. I want some honest input from others on how risky these etfs are? Will I regret not putting 1,000 dollars more in later on? Should I play it safe and only put a couple hundred in and put more in each week? Also what are some good sources I can follow to keep up on these indexes? 

Any input/advice is greatly appreciated!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ What stocks have you guys been eyeing lately?

And, here is the most important point that a lot of readers keep missing:  


>The prevailing narrative is that Wall Street short-sellers were caught flatfooted over the past two weeks as retail traders banded together via Reddit message boards and bought up stocks that hedge funds were betting against. **But some market participants**, including famed short-seller Carson Block, have started to **speculate that the short squeezes that drove GameStop, AMC and other stocks** to exorbitant heights **might have also involved professional investors who either took advantage of the Reddit-fueled frenzy or helped hype it.**  
>  
>The SEC hasn’t said whether there’s anything to Block’s theory, but acting chair Allison Herren Lee said in a statement earlier this week that the agency was looking at “compliance with regulatory obligations, adequate and consistent risk disclosure, and determining if any fraudulent or manipulative behavior has occurred.”  
>  
>**There is also mounting concern about the possibility of bot activity in Reddit’s WallStreetBets chat** after a spokesperson for the forum told CBS News **that there was a “large amount” of it** and that some posts were being blocked by an automated moderation system.

  
And also all of this:

>Regulators typically start their investigations by using algorithms to hunt through tons of data to try to spot suspiciously well-timed trades, including signs that such bets were coordinated, Bennett said. Then they would try to match up those trades with posts on social media, while sorting out who wrote the posts and what their intent was, he said.

&#x200B;

**TL;DR:** the SEC isn't going after everyone on WSB - in fact, they're not even saying they're going after anyone on WSB.  If they do, **it's going to be the professional traders** that went in and started **giving misinformation** **and** **attempted to manipulate the subreddit for their gain**.

**Please don't buy into tweets or brief headlines that claim** the SEC is hunting down Redditors and not looking into brokerage apps and hedge funds - they're looking at all angles, and I'm sure they'll bring to justice the people who manipulated the masses - do some DD for yourself and spend the two minutes it takes to read articles in their entirety._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Can someone please explain this to me? Let’s say I am a hedge fund and I want to short company X. The current price for a share in company X is $10. I borrow the share, sell it, and try my very best to make company X go bye-bye. 

Now, due to unforeseen circumstances, the price for a share in company X balloons to $100. I am not in a good position and my rich daddy is angry with me. Rather than take a loss, I simply short the stock again at $100. I borrow another share, sell it for $100, take the $100 profit and turn around and buy a share. 

This would accomplish two things for me: 1) I can cover my short at $10 without taking any loss at all, and 2) it keeps the price of the stock relatively flat as I have both sold and purchased a share.

It looks like the replacement to the Grumman LLV used by USPS will come down to either the Oshkosh or the Lordstown motors bid. Given that Biden is saying Federal vehicles will have to be EVs. 

Either would be a smart choice, but my suspicion is that Ohio’s swing state and 18 electoral votes vs Wisconsin’s 10 (typically non battleground) electoral votes will lead Lordstown to land the $6B bid.

There is no more perfect an example than the current state of WSB. Thousands of people, in denial that they bought into a trend that let the WSB OGs profit off of them, are struggling to accept the fact they lost money. 

I understand it, at its core. People rarely like to admit that they were wrong, especially where money is concerned. It sucks to see people trapped in this psychological prison they’ve made for themselves, compounded with being in the toxic echo chamber that is WSB.

For me, I really like to play poker, which I see as a great analogy to this. People over in WSB knew they had a bad hand, but bid large after the flop. The flop didn’t help improve their position, but they think they can bluff their way out, even though deep down they know they should fold and cut further losses. They ride the river all the way to the end, and finally get beaten holding their 2 and 8 of different suits in their hand.

Mentioned:	TSLA
Tesla Inc's (NASDAQ: TSLA) newly refreshed Model S and X bring many enhancements, with some of the most obvious being the 17-inch landscape touchscreen up front, with an 8-inch secondary display for passengers in the back.

Tesla's new gaming compuer will have 10 teraflops of gaming power, which is on par with the new PlayStation 5.

Now in a story covered by Tesmanian, it seems Tesla could possibly be going forward with a Navi 23 GPU from AMD. Someone posted a diagram on Twitter showing an AMD Navi GPU interfacing with other Tesla parts. This would lead to a powerful gaming experience that could be compared to the new Microsoft and Sony gaming consoles released last year.

Is an ETF determined by the performance of their fund holdings or by the amount of people buying the fund? 

Here’s an example: If ETF-A is at $100 today and they hold $100 in value from 3 companies, and those 3 companies go up 20% to $120.

Does the ETF price go to $120?

What if no one wants to sell it at $120?
Can the ETF then trade at $130 when underlying holdings are $120?

I attempted to resolve a margin call by selling stock. After doing so, my margin call doubled without any significant change in the value of the underlying stock. How can this happen?

Background:

I purchased most of my stock portfolio with cash. I bought into BB on margin a while ago, just before the GME/hedge fund shenanigans. In the last week, my broker (not robinhood) announced BB is not marginable and I received a hefty margin call for the total value of my BB shares.

BB has been bleeding day over day as brokers continue to limit trades. I decided to sell half my shares to reduce losses and resolve a good chunk of the call:


BUY: x shares @ 9.60

(received margin call)

SELL: 0.5x shares @ 11.50

(margin call doubled)


I sold at a profit. I don't understand how the margin call increased. Has anyone else experienced this before?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ VGT vs QQQ? What do you recommend?

I'm in a position to have the option to exercise my company's vested options in March, which I'm assuming would still be pre-IPO however there is a chance IPO can happen before that. I want to take advantage of getting my options now so I only have to worry about taxes between my strike price and the FMV. I am looking to exercise these soon as I may leave my job in the coming months. Current vested options and pricing is as follows:

16,041 shares vested out of 38,500 total.  
$3.25 strike  
$6.68 fair market value

* It would cost me about $52,000 to exercise my vested options at this time.
* I really do believe in this company to succeed wildly which is why I'm even considering this, even if the strike price is kind of high. Some questions:
* How I can exercise this if I don't have the cash upfront to buy it?
* What happens when the company IPOs? Is my option at that point to sell to cover?

Given how bullish I am in my company, does it make sense to just take the $52k out of my current brokerage account and buy the options? I was fortunate enough to ride GME and take a nice profit, so that has made this opportunity available to me. But I'm worried about how taxes will work. Ideally I would like to leave my broker account alone but if this is my only option, might be worth it.

I do not want to discuss whether this is happening right now or not, but if it is actually possible to do...

So this term apparently originated from WSB which makes a lot of people claim this is made up bullshit. However, I would like to know why this would be impossible as some people at [money stack exchange](https://money.stackexchange.com/questions/135807/closing-shorted-positions-via-short-ladder-attacks) claim - mostly due to NBBO (national best bid and offer). 

Please, correct me if I am misunderstanding anything. Because I don't get how NBBO would prevent such a thing.

Looking at a very special situation in the market:

Let's say there are 100 floating shares available at the market. 80 are held by people who are not willing to sell regardless of price.
5 are held by "normal" market participants who will sell if the price drops below a certain threshold.
Then there are two hedgefund buddies (person a and b) - one with 15 shares and the other one without any. 

So let's assume a price of 100 USD per share and person A offers to sell for "best market price". As there are no other active participants in this scenario, person B can just dictate the price, e.g. 90 USD (which would be NBBO, right?). And now they can do it vice versa for 80 USD. Rinse and repeat until the "normal market participants" are selling their 5 stocks as well...

Am I looking at this the wrong way? What makes this scenario impossible as some people claim?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Old fart advice for young investors There seems to be a lot of interest in stocks from young investors. I imagine that many will make their way from WSB to this sub because WSB is a bunch of monkeys flinging poo. You may have lost some money and now you want to explore stocks from less of a Meme and emotional perspective. 

There is nothing wrong with Meme stocks. Meme stocks can be fun. I have had fun with it. I am also a 42-year-old man with rental properties, commercial properties, and a few small businesses. BB, NOK, AMC, and even GME are all fine. The DD is fine behind all of them. The issue is that if I lose $1,000 then I can write myself a check from one of my businesses for $10,000 to make myself feel better. That is not a brag...it is simply sharing that people come from different places in life. 

You are just starting off life and probably have far fewer resources and every dollar matters more. 

I challenge anyone to CMV but I am not a big proponent of stocks as a core investment strategy. Here are my reasons why.

1. Information has a time-decay of value. Meaning that information becomes less valuable over time. Data is what is mined to often produce new Information. You are at a disadvantage when it comes to both data and information. The information that you get on a retail level has already lost much of its value. This is where the saying "if you read it in the news you are already too late"
2. You have no power. You simply cannot compete with whales and whales don't become whales by letting people glean the crumbs that are leftover. They have the power to move markets, you don't.
3. You have no control over outcomes. You have no control over the success of a company. You have no control over other investors. You have no control over anything.
4. The odds on options are not that great. Even compared to blackjack our betting the outside of a roulette table they are just not that good. 
5. Many people that are far more intelligent than you are, lose money at stock investing.
6. Your emotions and FOMO will be a hindrance and problematic. 
7. Most stock investors are too young to understand the market cycles

I like stocks as a small part of an overall investment strategy for young people for the following reasons.

1. Time is valuable and you have the most time
2. Compound interest is the "force" behind all investing and compound interest compliments the stock market very well
3. Certain strategies can complement long-term wealth building

Building wealth through stocks is like trying to build a house one brick at a time...just you, and you are gathering the straw, digging the mud, and pressing each brick by hand. When it rains many of your bricks will wash away. If the sun shines for enough days then you will make good progress. 

The problem is that all markets cycle. The housing market cycles. Petroleum and natural gas cycles. The stock market cycles. I believe that a full market cycle is around 18 years with around 7-12 years in an up cycle and 6-11 in a down cycle. In the stock market, they call these bull and bear markets. We are currently in one of the longest bull markets on record due to interest rates and the feds printing money. No one has a crystal ball but sooner or later the market will peak. When this happens Boomers will be the first to pull money out and put it into bonds or CDs. Boomers are as big of a whale as retail can get. Anyone and I mean anyone could have made money in the current market. If ten years ago you had asked a five-year-old to pick five of their favorite things and invested in their choices you would have made money. That could be Barbies, YouTube, Pizza, Sprite, and their Dog. They would have made money on any stocks you picked around those five things. 

There will come a day sooner or later when Boomers and GenX will see trends in the market that they don't like. Boomers own multiple houses and are deep into retirement. GenX is a small but powerful generation that is now on the back Nine Holes of life. Gen X will largely inherit the wealth of the Boomers. There will come a shift towards mitigating losses and that shift is not far away. When they move their money from markets so goes the market.

Is it fair to say that one of the longest bull cycles on record could transition to one of the longest bear cycles?

Let's look at Millenials...a generation that is struggling to just buy a home. Boomers own a few. GenX may own a couple and Millenials that are now entering into their forties struggle with one. Millenials are a massively sized generation that I believe is now bigger than both GenX and Boomers combined because Boomers are dying at a rapid pace. Millenials are the generation that were adults starting life and careers in 2008 and full-blown families with Covid-19. Maybe one of the unluckiest generations. 

GenZ is this very talented and intelligent generation. Y'all are creating disruptions in culture, in politics, and in Wall Street. You are savvy and demanding. Giving billionaires the finger while pissing on the front door of their mansions. 

But you need to be careful.

Stocks are not the key to your success. They are just a single tool in your toolbox. A better tool may be early homeownership or owning a small business. Life is about options...and I am not talking about the gambling options of Wall Street. I am talking about the options of having equity in a home to adapt to economic swings. I am, talking about the options of owning a small business where your day to day decisions make you smarter and more valuable. Where you own assets that make you money. Most importantly you have control over your own destiny.

I am not telling you not to invest in stocks. I am just telling you that it should be a limited part of your overall strategy in life. Unless someone has been through two complete cycles of the stock markets then I would take their advice with a grain of salt. 

General advice:

1. Don't sell stocks that you have taken a loss on
2. Buy when everyone is selling and sell when everyone is buying
3. Invest in stocks with a strategy based on your knowledge and experience
4. Invest only what you can afford to lose
5. Stocks work best with time. Leave them alone
6. Be a value investor
7. Invest with a purpose

Number seven is important. For example, I like Robotics, AI, and Automation. I like these is two specific areas....transportation and mining. I operate in the Transportation industry. I know that very soon human drivers will be eliminated and self-driving trucks will take over. Trucks will be loaded, driven, and unloaded without a single human being doing any of that work. With that will come an entire supporting industry. Tow trucks will need to be automatically dispatched when trucks break down or in accidents. AI will need to be involved in decision making. I will see these changes before I am dead and I am 42.

I like underwater mining. Our oceans are the next frontier and the next gold rush. We have areas of sea bottom that has very little life but is rich in gasses, minerals, and thermal energy. Automation, AI, and robotics will play a huge role in underwater mining. I will see this transition start in my lifetime and I am 42.

Beyond that, once we have machines that are capable of underwater mining then we have the basics for machines that can mine inner-system planetary objects. From nearby asteroids to the moon, to thermal energy collection closer to the sun, to Mars and beyond. The wealthiest person in existence will be the person that is able to start the first off-planet mining operation. Where there is no EPA, no taxes on land, where we are not building sub-divisions next to mines. Where we don't have to worry about the ecosystem. Where gasses and pollutants are not pollutants because there is nothing of consequence to pollute. The largest land-owners in existence will be the owner of off-world mining operations. That may not happen in my lifetime...but it may in yours.

I like investing in Meme stocks because they are fun. But I also invest in Robotics, AI, and automation with one-single question....is this company taking humanity one-step close to automated transportation or underwater mining? I invest with a purpose. 

Sure I will grab up some value stocks every now and then. People are going to be flying more than ever in a few years. People are going to be more social than ever in a few years. Shoot Condom manufacturers are a buy right now because people will be..........you get the idea.

The whole reason that I wrote this excessively long post is to maybe get you into thinking about your strategy....what is it? And to caution you on being "all-in" on stocks.

*  Some DD in [this thread] (https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/l0r9cm/sens_up_70_today_and_why_it_can_still_have_room/) from two weeks ago. Diabetics is a huge sector of the market and SENS has the superior product to existing Dexcom and Abbott. Their product is improving and gaining some traction from healthcare providers.

**Sports Betting/iGaming ETF - $BETZ** (1.2% of portfolio)

* Gambling on gambling stocks :) Sports betting's outlook is looking promising as the prohibition cuts back. Major holdings are Draftkings and Penn National (Huge casino chain with sportsbook operations).

**XPENG Inc - $XPEV (2% of portfolio)**

* China is pumping out EV's and Chinese consumers  are purchasing at record levels. XPENG differentiates with smart technology and robotic designs, looking to capture the ever growing market of wealthy Chinese buyers. Great vehicle delivery numbers means I think they are just getting started.

**Compass Pathways - $CMPS** *(4% of portfolio)* 

* First psilocybin therapy to reach the market. Only company in the US with FDA approved trials on psilocybin to treat depression. Biggest company in the space and furthest lead in the US (biggest and most restrictive market). If you want to bet on the psychedelic space as a whole, this is the first company that will be relevant in the US (if approved). I'm a fan of some other stocks in the sector but they aren't allowed in this sub.

**Hims and Hers ($HIMS)** - (4% of portfolio) 

* Online telehealth for previously unrepresented services (Erectile dysfunction, hair loss, skincare). They sell their own pills and contract their own medical officials.

It has a price:sales of 6.9 compared to twitter's 12.7 so it's already undervalued there compared to twitter. Over the past 5 years, its sales has increased 40% annually compared to Twitter's 20% annually. It's earnings has been growing as well at a rate of 50% annually in 5 years. It has more active users than twitter at 445 millions active monthly users compared to 330 millions for twitter. China has a population of 1.4 billions so it has room to grow. China's economy is on the up and up with more and more people getting online. So, WB is a pretty decent growth stock with long term holding potential.

Interestingly, WB has a very high short interest % of 66% last reported to finviz. Not as crazy as GME was, but pretty high none the less. I believe this has drove the price down from its peak of 140s to 40s currently. This could make it a potential target for a mini short squeeze.

A few years ago I enrolled in a post-grad business program, which was started by someone who had founded a few business schools across Canada. We did a component on company evaluation and investing. Here are some of the things I learned. 
Rule 1. Satisfy customer needs. 
If the company/product/service is not able to satisfy the demand of the customer, chances are the company won't last long-term, or will struggle.
Rule 2. Market share, market share, market share. 
If a company cannot protect, or maintain its market share, or advance with current tech/demand, another company will take advantage of that. 
Rule 3. Invest in the COMPANY, not its share value. 
Understand the company. Learn how to read their financial statements, and performance indicators. Research the CEO's and who's in charge. Know what their track record is. What is the company about? Know their mission statement and company values. What do employees think of the company? What is their market share? How are they adapting to markets? Who is their competition? Know what those companies are about, as well. How do they fit within the global market? What are their views on environmental impacts and sustainability? 

With all that said, there's more that goes into the decision on whether to invest in a stock or company, but this is part of the process I follow to determine that.

(Retirement Account) After looking for ways to help increase my returns for my retirement account, I'm 28 so long way to go, I noticed this website discussing the option of using Ray Dalio's "All-Weather" diversification model but using leveraged ETF's to help boost it's returns.

https://www.optimizedportfolio.com/all-weather-portfolio/

I like the all weather approach compared to a split of bonds and stock index funds because you cover all the seasons of the market.

I know the large debate over long term leveraged ETF's are volatility and leverage decay, plus putting all of your money into one such as SSO (purely the stock market) is that in the long term it will lead to your demise.

But by covering multiple fronts are you not reducing the risk of a overall downturn in your portfolio? On top of that bull markets last much longer than bear markets and there are times when all the "seasons" are going up. Where as when one sector goes down, another usually goes up (stocks and bonds).

Another argument is that some people can't stomach the higher volatility in an account such as your retirement.

I can see if you're looking to liquidate your assets in the next 5 years that you'd want to have a less volatile approach but for someone not looking to touch the money and put in monthly contributions I can see this being a great long-term investment. You could even go from a AW2 to a regular AW as you near and enter retirement.

Hey everyone,

I’ve enjoyed the bit of attention to my posts on my bullish analysis on US Steel (X), and I wanted to do another somewhat brief write-up in response to news hot off the press. Another reddit user pointed out that they just issued 42 million shares – I have never encountered this before as a stock I’ve analyzed so I figured I’d do some research as I constantly strive to develop my investing strategy. I’ve got a ton of links for y’all so you can fact check and do your damn due diligence (D^4). This is compared to a previous 220M shares so if you take it at face value before additional considerations it’s a roughly 20% dilution. We’re going to use that number for valuation.

Analysis: Instead of holding onto cash, either for investment purposes in new facilities or to pay current debt or handle other volatility, X issued a dividend. A microscopic dividend. Why? An intuitive answer I’ve come up with is as a bullish indicator of strength. They have solid enough financials to pay this small dividend as a hey, take this for now, there’s more to come – as opposed to a 0.

Historical context(lots of links)

https://www.investopedia.com/us-steel-stock-hits-all-time-low-4799379

If you’ve paid any attention to my posts, X or just entered “X Stock” into Google or Bing and looked at the historical value of the stock, you will see that the share went up to the 170s in 2008 (holy fuck), and then post-crash it went down to around $16.70. I haven’t been able to find the steel index for as far back as 2008, but presumably it was pretty good for X to be that profitable, pre-crash. I did find however data for the last 6 years which I think tells a compelling story.

By 2010, the stock went back up to a high of 63.44 – a 400% ROI if you bought at the low of 16.70.

2015 – down to a terrible low of 6.15 which I believe is lowest in stock history.

2016: This is where things get really interesting. In January CRU is around the 390s/ low 400s, and X is around $7. By June, CRU is at 628 in that 6 months (50% increase in CRU), but X is up to 16.86 (250% ROI). It makes sense that a stock will go up if their product goes up sharply, but that disproportionate increase relates to some degree to the static fixed costs making the overall profit margin much higher. If you held on an additional month to July, X went to 27.49 for over 400% ROI in 7 months.

In 2018 we see X start the year around 39, peak at 45ish and then make a steady decline with some volatility all the way down until 2020. On the CRU side we see 675 in mid Jan to a peak of about 915 6-7 months later in June / July. There seems to be some sort of mismatch with X stock going down while CRU went up. Of note is that around 2018, the Big River plant started ($1.9 billion) and was completed in 19 months. I’m not going to spend weeks on research, but some ideas I have for the mismatch are 1) Investors already baked-in the rising CRU into the stock, 2) there was a drop in the dow from 26.5 to 23s/24s – perhaps construction and auto went down around that time, and perhaps we 3) see some significant investment spending and 4) investors factored in upcoming world-supply of steel as manufacturers built out capacity (China steel go brrrrrrrrr)  5) I’ve read about some X hiccups over the years.

In 2018 versus 2017 we see an increase in net earnings of 523M (9 months ended September) versus 228 in 2017 (9 months ending September), a 250% increase), and they did capital expenditures of 640M versus 291 in 2017 (roughly 250%). When they made big money, they invested it. Overall stockholders equity went up from 9.86B to 10.56B, debt increased by about 85B in total (lots of debt added and lots of debt paid in various categories)

From 2018 to 2020 we see a steady decrease with a lot of volatility that I’m sure people made big money on (swings of 20-50% 1-3 months multiple times).

Where things get really spicy – 2019 & 2020 (page 2,3)

https://s26.q4cdn.com/153509673/files/doc_financials/2020/q3/84575751-ec61-49fb-a8c8-fc059b707a23.pdf

2019 and 2020 start out terrible – 2020 by September has a loss of 1.2B versus net income of 38M in 2019. Yikes. We do however see that the total assets increased slightly from 11.6B to 11.7B. So they did a decent job at not selling off their income sources. Note that they went from 750B cash and cash equivalents to 1.7B (250%). Someone did a damn good job picking up liquidity – they haven’t been around since 1900ish for no reason! 

 

End of 2020 – really important (pages 5,6,7)

Despite a terrible year, financial magic takes X from a low of 750B cash assets in Dec 2019 back to 2B in 2020 – X has a demonstrated ability to generate lots of liquidity. The overall year has a loss of 1.17B, which isn’t surprising since the first 3 quarters were just terrible. Note 725M in capital expenditures in 2020 despite the rough year financing – someone in charge knows that there are things worth investing in (additional Big River-style plants?!?) It is NOW in the 4th quarter and 2021 that things are back to looking up again. By all measures steel appears to be cyclical and X has overall very sharp relation to the CRU index.

 

Now / TLDR: Steel hit a historical high of 1150 in the last day. X stock has in multiple cycles achieved a 250% to 400% ROI from lows to CRU peaks which typically occur around 6-7 months later. CRU index goes down as China steel goes BRRRRRRR – but Trump Tariffs & corporatist Biden seems likely to keep tariffs in place – the CEO of X in the recent earnings call seemed very confident that tariffs would remain in place – let’s be honest, someone probably talked to someone behind a closed door, their was fancy cheese and fancier alcohol, probably golf a technically-illegal cigar. All of my optimism for the stock’s value over next 6-7 months does not heavily factor in a successful infrastructure US government plan but that would be best case scenario.  Overall, I still believe that X is likely to reach the 30s-40s within the next 6-7 months barring some exceptional crisis. More than that, I have a suspicion that they are building up cash reserves to try to roll-out additional Big-River style plants. X went down to 16.50 today which I think is a nice discount for buy-in. I also think that even if X doesn’t shoot up this year, the hype around additional plants will mean healthy increases into the 20s and 30s over next 2 years – the Big River plant is apparently the first of its kind – see quote below – in a few ways. I think the upwards potential from overall economic conditions outweighs the dilution from shares issued – these executives aren’t stupid, they are doing what they believe will increase the share’s value and companies health. They have a demonstrated aptitude for managing liquidity and building capacity even in downturns.

I've been looking more into ARKK and overall I like the collection of stocks within it, however I'm not a big fan of excessively expensive ETFs (coming from a guy used to expense ratios of 0.04%)

So I considered using ARKK as a premade collection of potential individual stock picks to add to my portfolio (using my play money)

My main concern is that since they've already been added to the ETF I likely missed out on the gains from those individual stocks

Ideally, it seems that one would want to invest in a stock that is newly added to the ETF vs one that has already been in it for a while since, theoretically, that new stock must've been added due to it having good potential

My idea was that by choosing those new stocks, perhaps one can benefit from the research already having been done which led to it being added in the first place

I tried googling what they meant by closing public offering but wasn’t sure. I wanted to throw some money on this stock while it’s dipping but I don’t understand the news._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ GME POV: someone who already exited position  

Constant lurker in [r/stocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/) [r/investing](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/) [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) and occasionally [r/ValueInvesting](https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/) (weird combo I know).

Wanted to share a quick point of view of someone who got in relatively low (39) and got out in the middle (200, stop loss triggered), that I can feel a lot of people with common sense did the same.

Now I dont want to blame anyone on wsb, im a big fan of some DD there and made some small risky plays with the money I was ready to lose. Originally I got into the GME on the short interest DD, when the stock had some impressive jump but it was clear that there is more room to grow considering original thesis. I was happy with every uptick day considering my total portfolio before this play was 9k CAD (ended up @ 22k CAD after exit). But at some point, as many who's been lurking on WSB I started noticing a lot of new things. First of all enormous growth of the sub, but only in quantity. I've noticed that people will be spamming to the moon, diamond hands and than turn around and start asking questions such as "Why my stocks dont move on Saturday", "How do I sell a stock" etc. Clearly people got into something they had no idea about, jumping on the hype train, which is extremely risky when you are trying to play in the environment you dont understand.

Second red flag was the famous VW squeeze comparison. Every single down day people will be referring to that down slide of VW right before the squeeze. Now when you see it for the first time it makes sense, but when every single dip is referred to that one moment - it just gets super dumb even for WSB. Even scrolling to yesterday you can find some DDs referring to the dip as a last day to jump on the ship.

One of the most important things that forced me to put a $200 stop loss was the entry of new players. When it was just retail vs hedge funds field, it was decently position in favor of regular investments. Even after media joined it was still a favored fight, with Chamath and Elon and Cuban being pretty vocal in supporting GME holders. Unfortunately when brokerages realized that they can't handle the trades asset requirements (especially RH, where majority of old WSB users and new retails investors are holding their positions) and SEC joined the party with rumors of investigations/suspension of trading I promptly setup my stop loss, guessing the game is over.

Crucial thing to realize in both investing and speculation (like this one) is that uncertainty is bad, especially when its a negative uncertainty, especially wen majority of the retail players involved are newbies. If it was just WSB - they could hold the line no problem, I believe in the guys who can leverage their life savings on 0DTE FDs on some shaky company. But when its moms and grandmas who are investing, any negative news on TV will shake their positions. At the end of the day, their way of thinking (its either lose small now or lose EVERYTHING later).

Last nail in the coffin was the whole religious approach that started over GME. When it was an original play on short interest, with actual DD and projections - everything was civil. As soon as it transformed into "stick it to the hedges", "revenge for '08" it was over, because emotions is your worst enemy in investing. As soon as you are under emotions, you cant make decisions rationally and you just lose control over your position. You start dreaming about 10k price target, driving your new lambo etc.

End thoughts: I sincerely hope that squeeze happens and other people make money, but imo it got too hot and too public too early for it. Regardless if you invest or speculate - make sure you do your own DD, dont jump on a hype train (especially if you are new) and good luck in the future!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Strong ETFs that are worth taking a look at?

Hi,

I'm still new-ish to investing and after getting burned on memestocks I'm looking to rebuild my portfolio in some long-term safe bets.

So far I'm holding my AMC stocks (15@ 13-14$) in hopes I might get some profit or break even once they fully reopen. (Gamestop seems to be sinking even after rebounding 10% today,still holding).

I've been looking into investing into some safe bets long-term to make up my memehype losses,bee thinking about these two mainly:

\-AAL, they seem to be stable enough to not go bancrupt due to covid and with the vaccinations process in the US these should be a nice 2x profit once people start flying again,anyone got experience with airline stocks?

\-BB, despite the meme hype around it they seem to be pretty undervalued despite their partnerships with Amazon and cars companies, and their migration into the cybersecurity sector seems to bode well. My plan is to wait out the hype and try to get a couple dozen BB at below 10$ and hold them until they reach 40's (is that even possible?)

Any insight into these two + AMC would be much appreciated,

I WONT TRY TO CONVINCE YOU WHAT TO DO WITH YOUR MONEY. THIS IS MY SPECULATION, MY OPINION  AND IT VERY WELL COULD BE WRONG**

Hello all, 

I wanted to post last night as many of you commenters have asked for however my building lost power and it was absolutely awful. I am currently a refuge and my ladies house and wanted to get this out to the world.

Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor, but more importantly this is all simply speculation. If anyone wants to make counter claims they are more than welcome but word of advice to all readers. If anyone is claiming that they know exactly what is going to happen...they are lying. There simply isn't enough current data to push this either direction. I am a bull, big time and I would like to explain why.

**First let's talk about yesterday**

There are a lot of claims of short ladder attacks and the counter-claim is that it was MM's moving the price down. One thing appears certain, there is some sort of manipulation happening in an attempt to drive the price down. Whether this is MM's, HF's, or simply retail shorts and bears; there are a strange number of exchanges happening in a clear effort to lower the price. You can check out the real time quotes [here](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gme/latest-real-time-trades).

Another large thought about why the price should have gone **up** yesterday was because of the options thats expired Friday 1/29 ITM. The rule is T+2 meaning these individuals have two business days to cover. Well, we expected a surge of these individuals covering and it simply never came. Everyone was glued to the screen Friday ATH waiting to see the spike of covering...but it never happened. Monday again...never happened. Tuesday...oh boy this is their last day they have to cover! Yet...they didn't. So what does this mean? Well, I see two possibilities.

1. They somehow timed it perfectly and covered throughout the dips and spikes
2. They haven't covered yet

I'm in the camp of number 2 hence why I am a bull. If they didn't cover that results in a Failure to Deliver which you can learn about [here](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/failuretodeliver.asp). So what does this mean for us? Well, that would explain the tremendous price drop as FTD's create "phantom shares" a problem GME is already facing. This will dilute the price tremendously and the amount of FTD's that probably occurred would greatly dilute the price. "With [forward contracts](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/forwardcontract.asp), a party with a short position's failure to deliver can cause significant problems for the party with the [long position](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/long.asp). This difficulty happens because these contracts often involve substantial volumes of assets that are pertinent to the long position's business operations." From the earlier mentioned website regarding FTD's.

Now this is truly fascinating. The 2008 crisis was largely in part due to a mass number of FTD's. In fact, FTD's sometime intentionally happen...just to drive the price down for FUD so they can then cover at a better price. 

So if this is correct, what happens next? Well, either you can [read about it here](https://financialreview.poole.ncsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Fails-to-deliver_before_and_after_the_implementation_of_Rule_203_and_Rule_204.pdf). Simply put, the individual has to close out the positions after 13 consecutive settlement days of FTD. So all this logic about T+2 was actually just the logic to begin the FTD countdown, if it hasn't already started at the beginning of this.

Now, I'm not saying "nobody sold" of course people did. But volume is key and the interest in buying outweighed the interest in selling 3-1 Monday and Tuesday. Of course trades are 1-1 but interest was on the buyer side. 

Obviously, I don't even need to mention it but restricted trading really is what screwed this thing to begin with. My opinion? It wasn't to prevent a massive short squeeze, it was to buy them time.

**Today**

So why the hell did it spike this morning? Two reasons.

1. RH still has 100 shares limit on GME, now for those who don't realize, that doesn't mean that is 100 shares per day. No no. The restriction is you can own up to 100 shares of GME. If you already own over 100 shares that's fine, but anyone with less than 100 shares can only add up to that amount. This restriction has not changed and other companies such as Revolut are still imposing a 100% trading restriction on GME. So what did RH offer today? The ability to purchase fractional shares, which doesn't help a whole lot but the fact that buying pressure accelerated at the notion of fractional shares shows that there is still an immense amount of buyers out there.
2. GameStop [adds new CTO to the roster, an ex AWS lead engineer.](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/02/03/2169124/0/en/GameStop-Appoints-Chief-Technology-Officer.html) They added other executive positions as well. This further cements the change the company is taking.

Now, before I get into the rest I want to address something: the fundamentals.

There is a disturbing echo chamber around the idea that GameStop is a dying brick and mortar retailer and there is no chance at survival. That is simply not the case. I don't want to do a full GME DD here because this is about the second incoming squeeze. However, let me put it to you this way:

If you were told that a new company was IPO'ing and it was coming to the market with an infrastructure, new talented team, 50 million customers and their plan was to become an e-commerce company to compete with Amazon; their plans for the physical locations was to be game-centric, a place for e-sports to compete, desktop building kiosks, and the newest systems and physical copies of games for those who still love having a physical copy. Not just that, but this company already has revenue share deals with Microsoft and other bigwig companies.

Knowing all that information would you be interested in this company? My answer is an easy yes. The thing with digital transformation and companies changing direction is people get so lost in what the company used to be they can't see what the company is planning on becoming. If this was a brand new company that Ryan Cohen was leading with the same exact model people would be all over the concept. 

Enough of that. Let's talking about what is still going on today which is truly fascinating. 

So the good news created a large uptick follow by a combination of people escaping with whatever gains they could salvage and some more clear manipulation regardless of the source. But then what? Well, after the bounce down a lot of people saw this as a fantastic buying opportunity which made it recover quickly...but then something interesting started happening. It started uptrending. Slowly. Steadily. Uptrending. Lower lows, higher highs; no sight more beautiful. 

My interpretation? We found the bottom of the bears attack. The news has been consistently saying the squeeze is over but one and at time they are saying their might be a second surge and their reasoning is if retailors see this price drop as a buying opportunity instead of red flags, it will surely send the price up. The logic there is simple: if people are buying stock it goes up, if people are selling, it goes down. 

So today is pure magic. It doesn't need to be a wild swing up to be promising. What it needs to be is slow, consistent buying pressure even during restricted trading. 

But all the shorts covered! Simply not true. That is a fact. All we know is what people are telling us. Melvin says they covered. It will be the third time they have claimed that. Do I think they covered? Yes, I do. Does that matter? No. Now even if Melvin and others covered and the S3 figures are right that means the guess right now is that this stock is still 57% short. Based on their Twitter this isn't including newly opened positions which anyone in their right mind would certainly open a short position when it was 3-400. They thought this bubble would pop and they would make a quick buck. They saw it get down to $85 and started celebrating...but it starting climbing...uh oh.

Truth is, no one will know the real numbers until the 9th. I think it's a little too much tin foil hat to says those numbers will be misconstrued but what we have witnessed over the past few days...it's possible. 

So let's talk about who is currently holding GameStop. Well, a shit ton of degenerates that have lost millions of dollars and seemingly don't give a shit. They are here out of principle, truth be told, so am I. I absolutely refuse to give any shares to the shorts after the crap they pulled last week. So we have a ton of bag holders refusing to sell and a ton of people wondering if now is the time to get in for a potential epic second short squeeze. No one is going to sell at these levels. Some people here and there but it simply isn't worth it, not with so much potential for a second squeeze.

**So when will this second squeeze happen?**

If the newest shorts are smart, it already begun. If I took up a short position and saw this start climbing again after everything it has been through, you better believe I would be covering now while I have profits. Not all of them are going to do this, which is why as the price gradually rises the potential for a larger and larger squeeze is exponential. There is no telling when it will happen. It could be a slow climb for the next couple of weeks before it pops. The 9th will be a huge indicator of what is to come, if that has anywhere above 50% short interest you better believe everyone is going to hop right back into it. It could happen as early as this week. It could be post earnings when Papa Cohen tells us his majestic plans during ER. It could be that ER will actually be fantastic on 03/05 because it will have the console cycle numbers. Look at GME charts in the past, the console cycle always makes the stock pop and with all this attention that very well could be the catalyst.

**In summary**

I wanted to do deeper analysis for you all but I knew some of you were really looking forward to the next post and my thoughts regarding the situation so I wanted to get something out there. In my opinion, a second surge, a second squeeze is bound to happen. This is a buying opportunity for those who missed the first one and I think the market and stock price is reflecting that sentiment. 

Positions:

1100 GME @ $16 closed

500 GME @ $20 closed

50 GME @ $120 open

236 GME @ $250 open

&#x200B;

**TL;DR:** I have yet to see any indication or good thesis to explain why the short squeeze would be over. Even if Melvin covered and even if S3 numbers are correct at a 57% short, these are indicators of another squeeze, potentially even more epic. The bleeding days of red on Monday and Tuesday I personally think was a combination of panic selling when premarket and ATH didn't blow up due to the ITM calls and phantom shares being created due to consistent FTD's diluting the share price. I do think these FTD's were intentional and what many are perceiving as a short ladder attack is in fact the creation and purchasing of phantom shares driving the price down. If you are a bagholder, I think it wise to hold, if you have already closed your position I would consider what we are witnessing as another buying opportunity.

Final disclaimer. I have already made a significant sum of money on this GME play. This post is not a hope that you will come rescue me from my bagholding status. The money I put back in was money I was willing to lose and I came back in out of principle to stick it to the man. Good luck everyone and be grateful to be alive during this time, this will go down in financial history quite possibly forever.

Nokia is set to release their earnings on Thursday. When Ericsson released their earnings they were way higher then projected. Ericssons stock has done extremely well since their report and they are a pretty similar company to what Nokia does.  Nokia has landed a lot of big contracts example being they are building T-Mobiles infrastructure. Nokia was up 100% before it was added to restricted lists, which caused the stock to plummet. Now it has been removed from the list completely right in time for us to buy low and hope they have a great earnings report. Anyone agree?

Currently up 20-30% every week for the past 5 weeks._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $LUMN - Lumen Technologies - Value buy, long position, lots of potential **THIS IS A LONG POSITION**

&nbsp;


**Why I invested:**

*  The largest upside I see in Lumen's future growth is their fiber infrastructure. Depending on what source you reference, Lumen either has the largest fiber network in the US or is in the top 3 along with AT&T and Verizon. In either case, the need for larger, wider-reaching fiber networks will only grow in the future. In my opinion, 5G will be the springboard that propels the next great leap in technological advances. 

&nbsp;

* [Tier 1 network provider (Approx. 7 in the US)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tier_1_network), ranked [#1 in terms of CAIDA AS Rank (The CAIDA AS Rank is a rank of importance on the internet)](https://asrank.caida.org/). What that means: They provide/have the capability to provide the most internet connections to direct customers (other smaller networks(Tier 2) and indirect customers/end users (even smaller networks (Tier 3) and eventually you and I). 
  * Maybe an analogy to help better explain this is to think of it like railroads (I know it is much more complicated, especially with railroads, but simplifying for this purpose).
      * BNSF (Tier 1 Network in this case) owns, maintains and uses the rail lines (fiber network) between Seattle and Chicago. They have trains running regularly but their rail lines are far from being congested so they allow smaller rail transport companies to use their tracks for a fee.
      * Amtrak (Tier 2 Network) cant afford to build/maintain their own cross country rail lines but have passengers they need to get from Seattle to Chicago. So they pay BNSF to use their rail lines to efficiently get their customers to their destination.


          ^ To tie up this example for network traffic, there are only 7 Tier 1 networks and all smaller companies need them to provide service to their customers.  

&nbsp;
 
* 9.5% annual dividend yield (very high relative to market) 

 - Per multiple reports I've read, this number does not seem sustainable, but [they actually have been doing this while also paying off their debts.](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/LUMN/lumen-technologies/debt-equity-ratio) 

&nbsp;

**What this all adds up to:**

Their share price has suffered over the past decade because CenturyLink was unfocused while also being obligated to provide dying services (landline) and trying to compete with other ISPs. While they have held and made new substantial infrastructure investments in fiber and network services, the business was not focused on where they can increase profitability.

&nbsp;

Enter rebranding to Lumen in September 2020. They have been and will continue to trim the fat through reorganization/restructuring to focus on their network services and enterprise solutions. Their available infrastructure has them well positioned for growth as their fiber internet becomes more widely available and increased demand with 5G networks emerging.

&nbsp;

All of this on top of the expectation that their nearly 10% dividend yield should bolster an investment in the short term while their growth goals materialize.

EDIT: Realized I had two sentences that got mangled in my first paragraph when I copied this. Also grammar._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Creating a strong foundation. Am I on track? I need a little input from those of you that have more experience in investing than I do.

The past week or so has really started the wheels moving in my brain to start investing for real instead of playing with virtual stock trading apps.  I got swept up a little in the frenzy as of late but luckily I didn't put too much money into it, so in the grand scheme of things I didnt lose out too badly.  The one thing this whole fiasco did was make me pull the trigger and start investing for real.  

Now that I got the FOMO out of my head, I decided I need to sit down and draw up an investment plan and see what I want to do.  So with all things built, I decided to build a foundation.

My main objective is to build my foundation out of a well diversified collective of main body stocks across the board.  I figured I would start off with primary stocks that are long term then have subcategories of those primary stocks that are traded more frequently than the primary stocks.

With me being rather new to actually doing this for real, I want to make sure my train of thought is on the right track.  Here is what I came up with.

The foundation stocks are in-


Automotive- Ford (F)


Energy- Williams Cos. (WMB)


Green energy- NextEra Energy (NEE)


Industry- Teradyne (TER)


Medical- Pfizer (PFE)


Restaurant- Yum! (YUM)


Bank/Financial- Bank of America (BOA) 


Entertainment- Sony (SNE)

Then the subcategory stocks would be in more in the realm or automotive parts, biotech or medical manufacturers, food production, construction companies, so on and so on.


With what I have come up with, is this a good foundation as far as solid and diversified stocks or do I need to shuffle things around?  Or am I way off the mark as far as dividing stuff into primary -> subcategory?

My assets are mostly in zero-fee index funds (S&P, international, small cap, and bond). I'm seriously considering adding a 10% allocation in PSHZF. I've been listening to a lot of Bill Ackman on youtube and really resonate with his investing philosophy. He seems brilliant. Obviously, the value of the fund has increased a lot recently, but I'm not somebody who chases performance. the fees are high (1.5% and 16%), which sucks. mutual funds, in general, seem like a waste of money, but the value I think I would get out of shares of Ackman's hedge fund is his business acumen through his being an activist investor. He has turned around a lot of companies. some failures, but mostly successes. Also, buying into this will get me essentially discounted exposure to PSTH. I'm interested in all opinions for and against PSHZF. If not PSHZF, I'm thinking maybe BRK, but still mulling things over.

Looking to start a discussion on which small/mid cap companies ($300 million - $10 billion) you think are poised for growth in the coming years.

These stocks also tend to be more volatile due to lower investor confidence, less financial resources, and lower liquidity.

Blackberry (BB) - As many people on here have said, the company has some good potential, perhaps 1 or 2 years from now. I bought this at around $12 before the craze and didn't sell it at its peak. If it drops or stabilize, ill probably average down and just hold out for the long run.

Plug Power (PLUG) - This used to be the darling of reddit and saw extordinary growths last month. As the biggest of the upcoming hydrogen power company (and one with actual tech and contracts); i believe it still has room to grow. I believe its building a gigafactory in Rochester which will allow them to scale nicely with increasing demand on the international stage. Also, Biden is set to announce his plans for infrastructure (including climate change) this month so maybe we can see some short term boost from that.

Palantir (PLTR) - Cybersecurity and data analytics is becoming increasingly more important. But, the real reason why I have this is because I got this when I just started out investing and now I'm working at a place that has a confidential relationship with them so I can't sell in the foreseeable future.

Canoo (GOEV) - Probably the most speculative of the bunch. Canoo is an up and coming EV company in an arguably already bloated space. I like that they have already working technology than their other early stage EV counterparts. And I think they could disrupt the market with their design and tech. The cons is that they won't make it to the market until 2022, which they will face some pretty stiff competition.

ICLN - Green energy may already be a slightly bloated sector but its a sector that will continue to grow because the world NEEDS to pivot. Plus, with the "rise of retail traders", I honestly believe we should put our money in social impact and into industries we believe in on a moral level.

Any possible cuts, swaps, or additions? Any sectors I should look into to diversify?

Thanks & enjoy!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Long Term Strategy/Sale of a Fund- INDZX Trying to ask the question here to ask more in general for items to consider instead of specifics for my scenario so it would potentially be helpful to others.

I've had a position in a large cap value fund (INDZX) since around 2008 (I inherited this several years ago)  - which sat there with an initial investment of $5000 and hasn't been traded in terms of any shares sold in that time. The dividends and capital gains have been reinvested back into the fund each time and taxes paid each year for that. I don't have need for the funds in the next few years and looking for a continued long term strategy here.

The fund has expense ratio and management fees (1.02% and .65% for management)- which is why  and potentially into something similar category with less in fees. It also makes up over 50% of my portfolio at the moment.

Besides the tax implications of selling and having to pay on the gains- I'm trying to figure out how to best assess whether being long in a position like this would make it worth holding vs selling all and investing either in another fund/etc and looking for advice on how to assess what makes sense.

I love watching stocks and have myself many watch lists on my broker that I like to keep an eye on to see if I should be getting myself into it or not. However, I’m watching so many stocks that my watchlists are a bit unorganized. I know this can be simply edited to my liking but I don’t only like to use stock pages to watch a stock. I like learning more about the company, doing research, and seeing what their future may hold. I don’t remember all this information by memory alone so I have these little note papers where I write down information about the stock. It works for now but it’s a bit of a mess as realistically how long will I have these note papers for before they’re lost or damaged?

**The play: Long stocks and ATM leap calls**

Summary: Aphria is trading at a hefty discount when comparing price multiples to its largest viable competitor Canopy Growth Corp (WEED.TO). As of the release of the company’s recent Q2 2021 financial statement, Aphria now has more revenue and a much lower net loss than Canopy Growth; however, despite all that, Canopy still has a market cap that is 4 times larger than Aphria. This I believe is a major pricing inefficiency created by the market because both companies are showing significant growth in their revenue while capturing additional market share in a growing industry while only Aphria has shown investors that is the only dominant marijuana company that can cut down costs and increases profit margins. Because of this, the premium in Canopy’s market cap is not justifiable and Aphria should be valued at least as much or even more than Canopy Growth. 

&#x200B;

**Industry Background Info**

Ever since the Canadian government legalized the recreational use of marijuana in 2018, Canadian weed companies have risen to become the dominant players on the global stage. As of right now, the four largest weed companies by market cap are Canopy Growth (WEED.TO), Cronos (CRON.TO), Aphria (APHA.TO), and Aurora (ACB.TO). 

Of this grouping, only Aphria has consistently shown investors that it can grow its business from both the top and bottom lines all the while making mergers and acquisitions that will allow it to capitalize on the growing recreational market in the U.S. Here let me show you why Aphria has the strongest fundamentals. 

📷

If you pull up Canopy’s recent quarterly report and look at their income statement, you will find that even though cost of goods sold (COGS) has a slightly decreased ratio to revenue from 76% for the first 3 quarters in 2019 (145,162 / 189,012) to 78% in 2020 (213,107 / 269,916), its total operating expenses excluding COGS, is still **LARGER** than its revenue (operating expenses are 489,216 for 2021). What’s more is that over half of this comes from SGA (Selling, General, and Admin). What this shows is that even though the company is growing, it is not becoming more efficient, rather it is becoming more inefficient. 

[https://www.canopygrowth.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/CGC-Q2-FY21-FS.pdf](https://www.canopygrowth.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/CGC-Q2-FY21-FS.pdf)

As for the other two companies Cronos and Aurora, their fundamentals are even more atrocious than Canopy’s. Cronos has revenue roughly 29million for first three quarters of 2020 which is peanuts compared to Aphria and Canopy. What’s more is that the company is showing earnings that are HIGHER than their total revenue. I suspect this is a result of their revaluation of their marijuana inventory which is complete bullshit because it assumes company can sell it all at the current fair market price and no auditor can accurately assess the true value of a living and growing agricultural product (trust me my background is in accounting). Why this company is worth over 5bil is beyond me. Aurora is similar with tiny amounts of revenue while operating at massive losses. The company didn’t even sell anything in 20q2 so I’m not going to go into great depth with either of them. 

**Tl;Dr:** The only viable competitor with Aphria is Canopy and right now Canopy is making less money than Aphria both in the top and bottom lines. The other two companies are essentially the weird kid in the class sitting in a corner eating chalk. Bless their hearts. 

&#x200B;

**Aphria Fundamentals**

Alright let’s get to the good stuff. Here is a pic of part of their income statement for you to follow:

[https://aphriainc.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/aphria-Q2-2021-consolidated-financial-statements.pdf](https://aphriainc.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/aphria-Q2-2021-consolidated-financial-statements.pdf)

📷

Right now, COGS ratio for Aphria is comparable with Canopy. By Nov 2020, ratio is 71% (219,136 / 306,221) and 74% (188,670 / 246,712) in 2019. But if you go down the statement you will find out that in the breakdown of their operating expenses, the company actually manages to keep expenses relatively stable as revenue grows. The only line that really stands out for me is the transaction cost expense of 25.6m which relates to business acquisitions. I think most of the 25.6m is related to their Tilray acquisition that I will discuss later on. Other than that, the company manages to stabilize its expenses and its total operating cost is far less than their revenue, which is something Canopy cannot say. 

[https://aphriainc.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/aphria-Q2-2021-consolidated-financial-statements.pdf](https://aphriainc.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/aphria-Q2-2021-consolidated-financial-statements.pdf)

Tl;dr: Aphria is a lean machine while Canopy is like a toddler that took one too many steroids and suddenly grew to the size of a NFL linebacker all the while having an IQ of 4. What this means is that Canopy’s growth is by no means sustainable and the only way for the company to continue operations is if it manages to grow revenue fast enough it outpaces expenses, but right now that is not the case. 

&#x200B;

**Tilray Merger Implications**

Recently in 2020 Aphria announced an all-stock merger (meaning Aphria will exchange a certain amount of their shares for Tilray shares). This is something I feel like retail investors need to look at more closely. The reason why is that the merger will give Aphria a strategic advantage of breaking into the US and EU markets. 

[https://www.livemint.com/news/world/tilray-and-aphria-announce-merger-to-create-the-largest-global-cannabis-company-11608361067376.html](https://www.livemint.com/news/world/tilray-and-aphria-announce-merger-to-create-the-largest-global-cannabis-company-11608361067376.html)

The advantage comes from the fact that even though Tilray is headquartered in Canada, it is registered as a US firm. What’s more is that Tilray also has agreements with EU countries that allow it to expand its position in the EU cannabis market. Tilray has announced it has been selected by the French national Agency for the Safety of medicines and Health Products to supply Good Manufacturing Processes certified medical cannabis products in France. In addition, the company also has agreements with other EU nations like Portugal that you can examine at your own free time. 

Tl;Dr: Aphria buy Tilray. Tilray in U.S and deal with E.U. This let Aphria go to U.S and E.U. This let Aphria bring in big mooneee. 

&#x200B;

**U.S Marijuana Legalization**

The Democrats taking control of the White House, Senate, and Congress is the equivalent of the second coming of Christ for the marijuana industry, and no this is not an understatement. Right now, marijuana is legal for either medical or recreational uses in 15 states but is still illegal on the federal level. What this means is that companies need to wait for states to legalize individually and even when they do so, there are still significant red tapes abound that will greatly hinder industry growth. One of the most prevalent examples of red tape is the fact that marijuana dispensaries do not have access to proper banking so they operate exclusively as a cash-based business. This is because if a bank provides services to a weed dispensary, it can be charged on the federal level for money laundering.  

That is all about to change because the Dems in the Senate announced that one of their main goals with their majority is to end the federal criminalization of marijuana use. In addition, Chuck Schumer already announced that a draft of the bill will be introduced in the first half of 2021. 

[https://www.9news.com/article/news/nation-world/federal-marijuana-legalization-senate/507-4de652b8-5f81-4ed4-94a2-502e5c1bef41](https://www.9news.com/article/news/nation-world/federal-marijuana-legalization-senate/507-4de652b8-5f81-4ed4-94a2-502e5c1bef41)

What’s more is that when weed is legalized on the federal level, it is actually legalized on the state level as well. This is because of something called the Supremacy Clause in the constitution that established that federal law controls when state and federal law are in conflict. 

*“but* u/gushingranny1*, if that’s the case, how come I can smoke pot in California huuuuh?”*

Well listen here you little shit, granny going to explain to ya. 

You see the constitution, though the Tenth Amendment delegates police powers to the states. This means that even though states cannot prevent federal prosecution of their citizens, they can still eliminate state prosecutions. 

[https://www.criminaldefenselawyer.com/resources/criminal-defense/federal-crime/medical-marijuana-federal-laws.htm](https://www.criminaldefenselawyer.com/resources/criminal-defense/federal-crime/medical-marijuana-federal-laws.htm)

**Tl;Dr**: Once weed is legalized on federal level, floodgates will open. You think marijuana stocks got crazy in 2017? Just wait for this one.

**Tldr:** For a short period of time, the 'Reddit Raid' impacted the overall economy in positive ways that we could not have predicted. For some companies, it was the lifeline they needed. 

**Winners: Institutional Investors, Companies, Employees, Real Estate (and local communities).**

**Winners**

**Institutional Investors:**

Silver Lake Partners – Silver Lake Partners is a private equity group that up until recently, had been a credit investor with AMC. Originally owning $600 Million worth of convertible bonds back in 2018, Silver Lake disclosed on Friday January 29th that they had converted their $600 Million worth of bonds into AMC shares and subsequently sold those shares for a $113 Million profit. This convertible bond event also dramatically benefited AMC through the obvious reduction in debt during a tenuous operating environment (more on that later).

GME Shareholders – It may be a surprise to many media outlets but institutional investors have made a sizeable gain when it comes to GME shares. Fidelity, Black Rock, and Vanguard own 13.7%, 12.3%, and 7.6% of shares outstanding respectively. This has led to a gain of $2.9 Billion, $2.6 Billion, and $1.6 Billion respectively for each of these institutional investors. 

Ontario Teachers Pension Fund – The recent retail action in favour of mall REIT Macerich (MAC) led to the largest shareholder; the Ontario Teachers Pension Fund, cashing out for $500 Million which has helped boost capital available for the pension obligations of the teachers paying into this pension fund.

**Companies:**

AMC - Due to the convertible bond action I highlighted earlier with regards to Silver Lake Partners, AMC saw an immediate reduction in the company’s debt by $600 Million dollars as the credit investor opted to take common equity instead. This reduced AMC’s debt burden and in turn has allowed them to look more favorable in the eyes of the credit market. The reduction in debt also helps AMC navigate the challenging operating environment that has been brought about by the pandemic and the restrictions. Two weeks ago, AMC was also able to raise $917 Million by tapping debt and equity markets which helped stave off concerns of bankruptcy. 

I suspect that GME will conduct an equity offering in hopes of raising cash to pay down debt. 

These developments have been extremely beneficial to both AMC and GME and may have prevented bankruptcy of both businesses. At the end of the day I don’t want to see either business go under because of the compounding effects it has on the livelihoods of employees, the real estate market, and general blight on communities if in fact their brick and mortar spaces became vacant. 

**Employees:** 

GME has 14,000 full time and 42,000 part time employees (as of 2019).

AMC has 4,408 full time and 36,000 part time employees (as of 2018).

The survival of these companies mean that these people still have a livelihood and this avoids adding more to the already substantially high unemployment numbers nationally. It seems like the companies will be able to stay afloat so at least some employees will remain.

**Real Estate:**

GME has 5,509 brick and mortar locations.

AMC has 1,004 brick and mortar locations.

The survival of these companies mean that real estate companies avoid large vacancies and communities avoid blighted zones of lost business.

From what I've read there seems to be essentially no downside for me except for possible unrealized gains if BB were too shoot up drastically past the strike price. 

This morning I sold 3 contracts at a premium of $45. I'm hoping to use these gains to make some smarter buys and also average down my 21.79/share BB price because I do think there is potential for long term growth. As long as I keep the strike price at a reasonable distance from the current price there isn't much risk for me correct? I'm only limited in potential gains at this point and whatever additional loss I incur if the price continues to drop which I can mitigate by averaging down, assuming my strategy is based on a positive long term outlook?

I've read that only 10% of options are exercised, but 45%-55% are sold-or-bought to close prior to expiration, implying that people are making money even when the option may not be in the money. But who is buying out-of-the-money options if an expiration date is approaching fast? Or is it common to buy options that become extrinsically worthless ($0 premium) days before the expiration?

I guess another way to think about this question: Say you have an in-the-money call (current price: 100, strike 90). As you approach expiration, the premium is going to drop, up to the point where it is worth $10 (or current-strike). But why would someone buy your 90-strike call 5 minutes before expiration for more than 10, or even at 10? I can see them buying it at 9.99 (or whatever it takes to cover the trading fee) and immediately exercise it, but if that were the case, wouldn't you expect to see the cover percentages be closer to the exercise percentage? Or is it just that a given option may be sold many times over its lifetime, so the 50% sell to close number just reflects that churn (and the last buyer ends up holding the bag)?

By roll on, I mean knock out of the fucking park.


Here’s some DD for anybody who doesn’t eat breath and sleep only GME.


eBay, like most other online retailers, are going to have ludicrous numbers in this last quarter due to the holiday season. That’s just a given. 


I am an experienced eBay seller who on a weekly basis for the last few years, sells around 15-20 items. The last few months was ridiculous. Items which were posted that would have around 10 bids and 5-15 watchers, would have 25-30 with 20+ bids. The views on each item was double to tripe from early November until pretty much the last two weeks. 


Lots of volume, lots of selling, lots of 10% commissions for eBay. Now we all saw what happened with Apple, posting 100+ Billion in revenue this last earnings report and being down 3% the next day. That shit happens, I’m not a psychic with a magic ball. If the market is tanking, the market is tanking. Look at it this week. But I will say this, the volume on eBay isn’t why I’m going fucking hard in the calls. Here’s the real cherry on top:

eBay has now finally implemented a payment policy they have been working on for a long time. Every single one of my sales went through PayPal, along with everybody else. Every single god damn transaction PayPal got their dirty little claws into. Since I think like the beginning of eBay, it’s just been a given that they give PayPal millions of dollars every month to run their transactions.


Well guess what you mother fucker. Shit had changed. Since they have now implemented their STRAIGHT TO BANK ACCOUNT POLICY, PayPal doesn’t even exist. The money goes, you guessed it, straight to your account. They even have their own return feature which they deal with themselves now, instead of putting funds into hold on PayPal. eBay allows you to chose when you get paid and in what frequency. For example, I have mine setup for each Tuesday of every week. 

This is going to and has already saved them MILLIONS in fees. Papa Musk has already moved on from PayPal, it’s time we do the same.


Oh, did I mention all the new payment platforms introduced as well? I bought a Pokémon card the other day without gay as shit PayPal but through god damn Apple Pay. It was way too easy. You can also link credit cards, bank accounts, whatever. It’s 2021.


eBay posts earnings in a few days, Wednesday after close. Do what you want. If the stock goes down, call me a dumb and make fun of me. If the stock goes up, fuck off and thank me later. Look at what it did today. I’ll probably sell a third of my calls on Wednesday for an IV hedge as well. Play at your own risk.

I'm really confused on when and how I pay the taxes on these? Does the loss negate the gain? Do I need to pay these immediately or is it like a end of year tax form? If you pay immediately where the heck do I go? How can I even get my total gains/losses? Do I have to figure that out my self?

Thank you all for the help!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Best mobile trading platform? So, I have an account with that company who shall remain nameless but it is not my primary account. I have used it since say the beginning of March 2020 to play with options trading because it was totally free. The bulk of my portfolio is in E-Trade though. That said, I actually really like the simplicity and how information is displayed in the nameless, faceless app. I would like to move whatever holdings I have out though in light of recent events and was curious if there are any other apps that have a similar type of feel in how they display charts and your gains/losses in such an easy to digest way over different time periods? I'd love for there to be much more information at my disposal too in comparison to nameless app but since I most often am looking at my accounts on mobile, I want the app to be as efficient and easily usable as possible. I was originally thinking I'd just transfer everything over to my E-Trade account but I've never been thrilled with their interface and their new app, while an improvement, isn't wonderful. So I thought I'd see what you guys thought about some of the others before I choose to stay with E-Trade. Thanks!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Question Regarding DRIP/My Plan Hi everyone,

Shockingly, this is not a post about GME or AMC.

I am seeking out some advice/ideas from the more experienced and smarter folks than myself.

I have been using some online DRIP calculators and it seems that I could be very well off, however, it does not even some possible to make that much.

A little background:  I am currently 24 and own 125 shares of apple with my dividend reinvestment turned on.  I plan on adding roughly $100 a week to my position.  According to the online calculator, in 40 years that will be worth a pretty insane amount (like $5-6M+).  Does that sound right or am I doing something wrong?

&#x200B;

Also, do you think Apple is a good one to be doing this plan for or should I do this in a different stock/stocks?

&#x200B;

My portfolio is fairly diversified as ? I own Tesla, some ETFS, etc.

&#x200B;

Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated!  Thanks in advance_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Will AMC recover again? Hi all,

This is probably a stupid question and even though I am aware none of you can predict the future, I still want to ask it.

I have invested a small amount of my portfolio in AMC (bought 70 shares at 7), but I'm having a hard time deciding when to sell considering this is still a meme stock. In hindsight I should have cashed out on Monday when it hit 17, but at that point I was still sure that it would rise even further. Now with the massive dip of yesterday I am not so sure anymore.

When do you guys think would be a wise time to sell? Since I just jumped on the bandwagon, I'm just looking for a quick profit tbh and I'm not in it for the long run (for AMC at least).

Thanks!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ My attempt at the “Reddit ETF” Reddit (and social media in general) has, in my opinion, a very interesting mix of strategies and approaches when it comes to trading/investing. A good portion here are looking for short/medium term gains with mild risk. Some play it safer, investing in index funds and ETF’s relying on long-term growth. Another percentage is looking to get rich quick, dumping their life savings into a single stock. 

I know the idea for a “Reddit ETF” has been floated here before, and I personally believe that with the aforementioned mix of DD/risk tolerance, it would perform exceptionally well. With several users posting a weekly recap of the most discussed stocks, I have decided to pull 10 stocks from these lists and invest $150 in each of them, totaling $1,500 in this “ETF.” The “Reddit ETF” consists of the following. 

-ARKK
-MSFT
-AMZN
-ICLN
-SPCE
-AAPL
-PLTR
-TSLA
-BB
-NOK

As much as I would love to invest more, I have a particularly small portfolio at the moment (life meant I had to pull most of my investments last year. Needed the money for immediate use). However, I do plan on contributing additional funds on a weekly basis to help grow. My questions for Reddit are as follows

-Is 10 different stocks too many? Too few? 

-At what point should I drop or sell of an underperforming/less discussed stock? Should I reevaluate the stocks included in the ETF weekly? Monthly? 

-When investing additional cash, should I evenly divide my investment across all stocks (I.E. if putting in an additional $150, put $10 in each stock)? Or should additional investments favor the better performing stocks?

I would love any feedback or suggestions! I plan on posting updates on a semi-regular basis (probably once or twice a month).

My question is with the expiration date. 

It seems AMC was listed on the SSR list effective date today, the third - and expiration date of tomorrow the 4th. 

Does that mean that the fourth in the morning the hedges can short sale all they want again? Or does it expire at a particular time tomorrow, the 4th??

Also: [Making Money in Best Reverse Mergers (and Cramer video)](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/jwu6sh/making_money_in_best_reverse_mergers_and_cramer/)

2020 saw the momentum-based realization of a few blockbuster event-level "IPO pops": Nikola (NKLA), Hyliion (HYLN), Velodyne Lidar (VLDR), Lordstown Motors (RIDE), and ChargePoint (future CHPT).  Capstoning these was the unprecedented hype of QuantumScape (QS).

Jim Cramer's statement of "maybe make some money" was an understatement, as common shares, warrants, and options each provide money-making opportunities that surpassed what can be found in a traditional IPO pop, including Snowflake's!

Options trading on these particular "IPO pops" has the potential for gains rivalling historical IPO pop gains such as the 195% of nCino (NCNO) and the dot-com record 698% of VA Linux.

2021 already saw the realization of at least two more such "IPO pops": Stem Inc. (future STEM) and Lion Electric (future LEV).

Despite all these blockbuster event-level "IPO pops," only one so far has reached $50 and beyond ($58.66) before changing to the operating company's ticker.

The company announced a deal to go public in June by merging with a [reverse merger company] and buzz began to grow online, with some thinking it could be the next Nikola.

> “I had invested in Hyliion on pure hype—literally pure hype,” Mr. Denton said. “I knew nothing about the company.”

> He said he sold after the price went up and made about $50,000.

Momentum trading during late last year, and also during the early part of this year, showed that the rest of 2021 has the potential to change all that and add more tickers.

# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Wednesday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/03/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-february-3-2021.html)

*****

> # 1. Dow looks to extend gains to a three-session rally

> * Dow futures pointed to a relatively flat open Wednesday, one day after the DJIA saw its best single-session advance of more than 475 points or 1.58% and its best two-session rally since November.

> * The back-to-back increase in the broader stock market coincided with a sharp two-day reversal in soaring GameStop, which saw modest gains lose steam in Wednesday’s premarket. The Reddit-fueled short-squeezed stock plunged 72% since Friday’s close of $325. In last week’s 400% surge, Gamestop touched an intraday all-time high of $483 per share.

> * Nasdaq futures were stronger Wednesday as Alphabet shares soared over 7% in premarket trading after the Google-parent reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings and revenue.

> * Ahead of Friday’s release of the government’s monthly employment report, ADP released its January look at job trends at U.S. companies Wednesday morning. ADP said 174,000 private sector positions were added last month. That was more than triple expectations. December’s tally was upwardly revised to a decline of 78,000.

*****

> # 2. Jeff Bezos to step down as CEO; Amazon delivers record revenue

> * Amazon founder Jeff Bezos said he plans to step down as CEO and transition to executive chairman, an announcement that coincided with the company’s earnings report that showed record quarterly revenue. Amazon cloud chief Andy Jassy will take over for Bezos as CEO in the third quarter. Bezos, 57, said he will stay engaged in important Amazon projects but will also have more time to focus on the Bezos Earth Fund, his Blue Origin spaceship company, The Washington Post and the Amazon Day 1 Fund.

> * Shares of Amazon were little changed in the premarket on the Bezos news and the company exceeding $100 billion in quarterly revenue for the first time ever. In fact, fourth-quarter revenue soared to a better-than-expected $125.56 billion. Per-share earnings of $14.09 nearly doubled expectations. Amazon’s cloud-computing unit, which Jassy leads, saw its revenue climb 28% to $12.7 billion, though that was lower than forecasts.

*****

> # 3. Alphabet beats quarterly results, reports Google cloud loss

> * A strong return to growth in its core advertising business pushed Alphabet’s fourth-quarter earnings and revenue above Wall Street expectations. The company made $22.30 per share on revenue of $56.90 billion. Alphabet disclosed operating results from Google’s cloud business for the first time, showing the unit lost $1.24 billion during Q4 and $5.61 billion for the full year. By contrast, Amazon’s cloud business earned an operating Q4 profit of $3.56 billion and $13.53 billion for last year.

*****

> # 4. Yellen calls meeting on market volatility, GameStop frenzy

> * Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen is calling a meeting of key financial regulators this week, possibly as early as Wednesday, to discuss market volatility driven by retail trading in GameStop and other heavily shorted stocks. Yellen sought permission from ethics lawyers to do so, according to document seen by Reuters. On Monday, Reuters noted that Yellen — after her time leading the Fed and before her Treasury posting — was paid speaking fees by a key player in the GameStop saga, hedge fund Citadel, as recently as last fall.

*****

> # 5. Biden, Yellen say GOP offer on Covid stimulus is too small

> * Yellen and President Joe Biden joined Democratic senators for a private virtual meeting Tuesday, and they declared a GOP offer of $618 billion in Covid stimulus as too small. They urged big, fast action to stem the pandemic and the resulting economic fallout. As the White House still tries to reach a bipartisan relief bill, Democrats marshaled their slim Senate majority to start a lengthy process for approving Biden’s $1.9 trillion proposal with or without Republican support.

Thoughts?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Part 2: Why did I invest in dying Oil Some time ago I posted **"Why did I invest in dying Gamestop"** \- [https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/e63owb/why\_i\_invested\_in\_dying\_gamestop](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/e63owb/why_i_invested_in_dying_gamestop/)

This trade has worked out quite nicely, though at times it was quite painful.

Here, I'm glad to share with you Part 2 of the "Why did I invest in dying X" saga.

I am betting heavily that we will experience an oil supply crunch in 2022.

\- All oil companies have lowered their CAPEX

\- Oil demand is set to return to normal 2022

\- Upcoming Infrastructure projects to revive the economy and massive spending bills

\- Political env. hinders the development of new oil fields thus reducing supply

\- Oil Rig count fell by 50% compared to 2019 lowering the supply

\- Boom in tourism starting mid 21

\- Maybe some black swan event - we have all seen when a retail drone has taken 10% of world oil supply, shit seems to happen every 2 or 3 years

I am closing monitoring CAPEX spending and how fast the oil is drained from the oil storage facilities. I modelled the drain and I expect the prices of oil to increase +$100 in 2022/2023. The entire trade is based on supply and demand. I do not believe in oil long term, but I believe that oil has one last big squeeze in the near future.

My portfolio consists of:

1. Supermajors: BP (leveraged with 30% on margin), target $45 USD, expected 150% (excluding dividends)
2. Heavily shorted, heavily indebted production and exploration oil companies - at the moment only Continental Resources Inc (expected ROI 400%, 10x with a short squeeze 5 days to cover)
3. Call options for Total and Shell (expected ROI 500-1000%)
4. Depressed Companies that can monetize on drilling projects: Fluor Corporation (expected 300%)

I'm going to increase my position every month until June ~~2020~~ 2021.

Many products in their pipeline are reaching phase 2 and 3 clinical trials with outstanding outcome. the results of this tech in fighting the most wide spread cancers and other life treaths are bound to be communicated properly.

The technology can be targeted to specific types of cancer and immune diseases, such as those produced by a virus." 

The inovio vaccine pipeline will trigger a paradigm shift in medicine. on a side note, INO will most probably release a COVID vaccine this year. Short-term growth of INO will be fueled by INO-4800, a DNA vaccine candidate to protect against coronavirus :

Thoughts?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Define your investment objective and recognize that massive losses do NOT mean this is a dip Seeing posts from people who rushed into GME >$400 and are losing financial stability and having to lay off employees is really starting to weigh on me and the credibility of the investment subreddits. 

**Anyone invested needs to decide which of the two following objectives they are going to pursue because the sad stories about people getting burned reflect people trying to pursue both at the same time.**  


* **Make (or at least avoid losing) money.**    
Any time a fund develops an investment thesis it will define conditions that call for exiting (typically selling) the investment. It could be anything. Typically it will be price targets^(1) or political events^(2). If you are investing to make money, your exit conditions limit risk by removing you from a trade going down to zero and locking in profit if an upside condition is achieved.   
If the money you are investing is material to you and your life in any way shape or form, you should pursue this objective.  

* **Break the stock market**  
If you want to burn down the system, you don't care about losing money and you should expect to do so. Anyone saying they and their diamond hands are holding until Melvin is out of business or until they die is essentially saying that they are willing to burn their money. For many people that may be a worthwhile expense. 

This post is not meant to tell you what to do, it is meant to tell you to be honest and realistic with respect to what you are trying to do by investing in GME, AMC, or anything else. If you are trying to make (or at least avoid losing) money you need to recognize that following the price run up shares of all the meme stocks remain highly elevated versus where they began the year and massive losses in recent days do NOT necessarily represent a dip. 

This post is not investment advice but I do hope you consider it seriously in developing your investment strategy. Play it smart people.

Thank you so much!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Someone Always Ends Up Holding the “Doo Bag” So a lot of folks have been posting about how they got caught up in—and subsequently lost money from—the GME/AMC train that was barreling through the stock market last week and the week before. 

I’ve read many posts across multiple subreddits about people who put in A LOT of cash into these trains hoping to hit the jackpot. I also saw many people admit that they put in money that they could not afford to lose.

To the people who are worried or freaking out about the unrealized losses that they have and the GME/AMC stocks that they’ve been left to hold, chin up. This should be taken as a learning experience and definitely set guidelines for yourselves in case something like this comes along in the future.

Before putting your money into any stock/company as a gamble or investment, please always keep the following in mind:

1) Invest only what you’re willing to lose.
2) Always do your due diligence and read up before you use your money on anything.
3) Don’t let your emotions control your decisions.
4) View hype trains with a little bit more skepticism.

I think what you have going for you right now—which kind of is going against you at the same time—is that nobody can and will ever be able to predict exactly what’s going to happen to GME and AMC. Hopefully, whatever happens ends up being favourable to you all. Good luck!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ What is good trading platform in the EU?

My position: 60 shares @ $24.13_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ DD: Long case on $ESPR by LockSmith Summary

Usually huge short-interest is a result of a company in trouble, poor prospects, bad management, financial problems etc. ESPR is a company with the short-interest of company in trouble with solid financials and an amazing future.

Listen up – this is the perfect situation for making some serious money. Think about buying GME before the squeeze got going for real. Even with the price estimate of the most pessimistic analyst we make money and once a squeeze gets going this goes to the moon.

· Massive short interest in ESPR (40%)

· With an average analyst price target of $76 (Yahoo finance)

· A few institutions own more than 100% of the shares,

· With multiple catalysts, including an expected announcement of a rest of the world deal in Q1/2021

· Sales growth of over 140% quarter on quarter

· Great bet by itself, the likely massive short squeeze is icing on the cake.

I will speak about likely short squeeze dynamics and then I will go over the fundamentals to show why the shorts are wrong to short this company. There are and will be a bunch of bashing articles but the simple facts laid out below refute most of the arguments made up the so called experts.

Short interest

The short interest in the company is perfect for a violent short squeeze. Institutions own more than 100% of the outstanding shares. DM me if you want to know how this happens. Retail investors can be scared by bashing articles, brokers yanking margin, putting shares on a do not trade list etc. institutional investors understand that they can demand and get whatever price they want, in order to permit the short sellers to close their positions.

With a bunch of retail investors it is very hard to get 100% of the investors organized (as evidenced by BBY, AMC message boards where the constant message is, "Hold, if we don’t sell the price goes higher"). With a few sophisticated institutions it is much easier.

The institution holding is interestingly similar between GME and ESPR at about 122%.

ESPR [https://imgur.com/vCOpaPW](https://imgur.com/vCOpaPW)

GME [https://imgur.com/ahnAGUs](https://imgur.com/ahnAGUs)

&#x200B;

Fundamentals

ESPR is not profitable. Their primary product NEXLETOL® was approved by the FDA in February 2020, this was followed by EU and UK approval in April 2020. The lack of profitability is not unusual given the recent approvals. The Q4 2020 sales growth QoQ was over 140% and sales should continue to ramp as the drugs gains market penetration in the US and more geographies come online.

NEXLETOL was launched in the US in March 2020 (just in time for COVID) and in Germany in November. Sales were hurt as COVID stopped a lot of patient visiting doctors, particularly as the target cohort tends to be elderly and vulnerable to COVID.

[https://imgur.com/Jngz0Eb](https://imgur.com/Jngz0Eb)

(Source: ESPR’s presentation at 39th Annual J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference (slide 16))

In January 2019 ESPR entered into an agreement with Daiichi Sankyo Europe (“Daiichi”) which gave Daiichi exclusive commercialization rights in the European Economic Area and Switzerland. The key commercial terms were $300 million in upfront and near-term milestones, $900 million in total milestones and tiered royalties between 15% – 25%.

In April 2020 ESPR entered into an agreement with Otsuka which gave Otsuka exclusive rights to NEXLETOL and NEXLIZET tablet development and commercialization in Japan. ESPR will receive an upfront cash payment of $60 million as well as up to an additional $450 million in total development and sales milestones and tiered royalties from 15% to 30% on net sales in Japan.

Source: ESPR’s presentation at 39th Annual J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference (slide 31)

This leaves the rest of the world (ROW) and ESPR has stated that they expect to receive an upfront payment of circa $40MM and that a deal is expected in Q1 2021. This is a double-edged sword as global exclusivity deals reduce the attractiveness of ESPR to large potential acquirers.

[https://imgur.com/WjvndLM](https://imgur.com/WjvndLM)

&#x200B;

The overall US market is estimated by ESPR to be 18 MM patients. At $3,650 a patient (gross). This represents a total addressable market of circa $66BN. A 2% stake in this would result in total revenues of $1.3BN ($18MM X $3,650) a 4X price to revenue multiplier gives a share price of $189/share excluding the rest of the world sales (assuming the fully diluted share count of 27.9MM).

The price ranges of the analysts are $35 low and $150 high with an average of $61. Slightly different to the Yahoo estimate, likely due to NASDAQ not using stale price targets.

One material risk on owning young biotech stock is the risk of dilution, this is particularly relevant as ESPR issued 4.00% Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes due 2025 in the amount of $250 million, with an option to acquire an additional $30MM. This risk is reduced as ESPR has entered into capped call transactions to generally reduce the potential dilution to Esperion’s common stock upon conversion of any notes.

ESPR guided for operating expenses between $320 and $340 million inclusive of $30 million of non-cash stock-based compensation. It had cash on its balance sheet of $305 million so they are fully funded for 2021 and there should be no further near-term dilution.

&#x200B;

Product Efficacy

Some very smart and experienced drug companies have paid significant upfront sums to gain exclusive rights to ESPR products.  This suggests that these companies see substantial sales potential in their territories. There are any number of bashing articles talking about the efficacy of NEXLETOL but I tend to give much greater weight to experienced drug companies who fork out actual cash rather than paid or unpaid bashers.

Some basic tips for those new to this world. (I am not a financial adviser.  This is not direct financial advice...but still advice for dealing with investing.)

I am completely floored by the amount of people who have NO BUSINESS independently jumping into the stock market, diving into the deep end and not knowing how to swim.

1.  Never invest what you're not willing to lose.  Do not pump every dime to your name into an investment.  This is almost a surefire path to failure.  If you invest in a stock, or a fund, only do so if the money you're investing will not be detrimental or catastrophic to your existence if lost.

2.  If you're new to investing, get a broker while you also do your DD (due diligence) researching companies you're considering investing in.

3.  Learn market terms such as "long", "short", "bullish", "bearish", "futures", etc.  And then learn the different ways to incorporate and utilize these terms.  That way you're not just limited to "buying/selling".

4.  If you insist on doing it yourself, do not purchase stock in a company without researching the company.  Their executives, business model, earnings, stock trend for at least 2 years (if available), etc.

5.  Learn about moderate to high yield ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds) and Index Funds.  Typically between 3-8% dividend yield is a great middle ground depending on the overall performance of the fund.

6.  This is one of the most important quotes, in my opinion, when it comes to investing:  "If you're not willing to own a stock for at least 10 years, don't even think about owning it for 10 minutes." -Warren Buffett 

7.  Learn the 4% rule!  Learn the 4% rule!!  Learn the 4% rule!!!

8.  Understand the formula for figuring out how much money you would need invested into annual return yield to account for your current annual income.  If you learn this, it will give you greater insight, a more clear, concise target, and a simpler goal.

9.  Find a mentor.  Trust me, you very likely know at least one person who is good with investing, and these people generally enjoy passing this knowledge on to others.  If you don't...FIND A BROKER!

10.  Do NOT jump on trends, fads, or bandwagons...you'll typically be left holding the bag because you didn't know any better, and you will simply watch those that did know make money and then bail._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ FINV (Formerly PPDF) undervalued or underperforming?

The business will bring together Xerox's expanding capabilities to better support clients' digital needs.

TLDR: I have gone in a little too high with APHA, as a split of my portfolio. Looking to balance that out today, but looking for inspiration my strategy.

I started looking into shares a week before all the GME stuff (didnt get involved in that) and decided that the cannabis industry looked like a good choice for my portfolio. After doing research I landed on APHA, and before open yesterday some DD saw that the price was going to go up - and it did!

I have 300 shares in the game that I got for around $300 - thats 1/3 of my total portfolio. I know this is too much but I had (correctly) anticipated to climb yesterday.

Now I'm looking for inspo on what to do next. I have faith in the stock long term, so my thinking is to keep an eye on the stock throughout today, take out $100, and leave in the rest. Does that sound reasonable? Any advice on timing.

I will not take anything as financial advice, I'm just looking for inspiration._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Charles Schwab Question Embarrassingly, I deposited $100 into a schwab brokerage account and then decided to use a different broker.

However, when I try to transfer the money back to my account, it says that my account is restricted. Is it true that I have to wait for the deposit to “settle” ? thanks!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ SRGA is surging and why this buy is going to hit my personal 3$ target soon and may go the moon from there (not GME related wow) Disclosure: I own 10,000 shares at $1.722 average.

Hello, I want to share with you my DD on SRGA (Surgaline Holdings) which I invested in on Friday, 1/29. SRGA is a spinal solutions provider, often time pioneering products - many of which have been flops during last year.

SRGA was in the headlines recently. In order to generate more capital and interest, SRGA [offered 25M shares at a very low $1.50 buy-in.](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/01/28/2165453/0/en/Surgalign-Holdings-Inc-Announces-Pricing-of-Public-Offering-of-25-000-000-Shares-of-its-Common-Stock.html) These shares were near immediately snatched up by big players as confirmed by OpenInsider.

**Why not SRGA?**:

* This company has seen MUCH better days and likely carries a real risk of insolvency if their previous trends continue.

**Why SRGA?**

* They have a new joint-fusion system which has performed well in clinical trials and may carry their revenue in the future.
* Prices are very low, this could be play for even small penny-investors. It would take a monumental squandering of their funds to go down below $2.
* Buy volume is so much higher than sales. I'm already up over 20% if I were to sell during this overnight surge. But I won't and most people aren't either. Keep in mind big players bought 25mil shares and none of them have sold. They all believe SRGA can go much, much higher. My point here is many of these SRGA investors will be tight-fisted and are not going liquidate at early signs of profit. This is not a 'good-day bad-day' stock this will likely be tightly held and see many good days for at least the immediate future.
* Long term posture and spinal issues continue to be an issue. The more and more we hunch over computers the more this sector should grow.

Anyone else into SRGA and what are your findings on it?

I am not a financial advisor. I am a licensed insurance vendor._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ I am a rookie, but WHY are we NOT talking about Rolls-Royce? I haven’t event been investing for a year yet, so I still have a lot of learning to do, of course. And I didn't go too in-depth with my DD on RYCEY.  I did notice that their balance sheet was fairly weak, but they did gain access to $6.5B to help support their balance sheet during the pandemic. That is a plus. Not only that, but the company makes and repairs engines for aircraft, with most of the profit coming from repairs. And of course, not much flying has been going on over the past year and we may not see any increases in flights, until later this year, once vaccines become more and more solidified. Sorry for not having a more in-depth discussion, it was just something quick I came about and was wanting some more opinions, from people who are not financial advisors, like myself.

edit: I also read that they are very "long-term" focused currently._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Help finding a good broker Hey guys, I was wondering if anyone could shoot me in the direction of a good stock trading platform.

In a perfect world, I would like to find a stock broker that:

2. Has a wide variety of features(lol honestly just the basics + margin, options and shorting)

4. Decent research
5. Does not sell your data to trading firms

Looking for new opinions to change my mind but I don't ever see a chance for tesla valuations to justify itself. I mean I've heard sayings of how tesla is more of a technology company and is really innovative. But what I do feel is that competition is growing and you could call yourself a tech company but without the solid profit margins, I don't see how it will work out. 

So any one able to help justify it?

Edit: 
Plus I identify automobile as a protected strategic industry for countries given how automobile factories would be required to be converted to tanks making factories in times of war which gave rise to famous german and japanese automobile makers in the past century. Something similar to a boeing vs airbus rivalry. Hence it would likely be protected and hence greater competition for automobile companies. Anyone able to comment on this thesis?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ The past week has taught me to be smarter and more patient. It has been almost predatory the way people are jumping on and I don't like it. I'm not rich by any means, but I have a good enough job and enough savings to be comfortable in the ability to lose money if I do. I also have not got a single clue what I'm really doing, like I imagine most people who will start to lose money who have jumped on the hype train. 

However this last week has just taught me to not to be hasty, be a sheep and get into something which can realistically only end up one way (down and losing). Some people are getting involved using student loans and life savings, without a clue what they're doing. They seem to be dragged in by the meme culture (which is now getting a tad annoying) and the hype and unfortunately will be the real losers here, whilst people who were in a month ago are the ones driving the new Ferrari now.

I haven't gone in, I'm not jealous like people are calling me because if you did then fair fucking play to you. To me, there seems something predatory about the way people are getting drawn in and there is a fine line between a hobby and an addiction. Lets hope it doesn't end up being the latter._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Missed out on five digits gain This is so horrible. I could’ve had bought a car but instead I was greedy and got exactly what I put in. It all started well, the stock I’m taking about is, you guessed it, GME.
I got in around $70, I watched it go up and up and always believed there was more to collect. If I sold at the peak of $480, I could’ve had the biggest gains of my life, but I didn’t. I then sold at $90, had some minor gains which were probably equal to the amount of fees I paid. Why didn’t I sell? Because I was greedy. Now I’m really regretting that. Of course, there are people who’ve lost everything on this and I shouldn’t be complaining, but it hurts being denied money because of my own stupidity. It’s not entirely my fault though, the Hedgefonds we’re pulling servere market manipulation. Anyway, I’m pretty depressed and wanted to know if anyone of you guys could offer some advice._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Decisions are always easier in hindsight. The meme stock ride of Jan 2021. I posted this in the daily, but I think given the magnitude of this, I'd make a post.

I know everyone is upset that they didn't sell Thursday close to $500. But lets he honest, unless you had a clear exit strategy, why would you have?

This was riding to $500 with so much momentum, it was about to once again hit every strike in the chain as ITM probably initiating another crazy Gamma Squeeze which really could have set off the MOASS. Then we know how the rest played out. Buying restrictions really destroyed all volume and momentum. But then there was the hype and Friday was back up. Truth be told, noone knew what would happen at week end. This was such a dynamic and unique situation. **Unique**. As in - in no way related or could be extrapolated from VW.

A friend told me over the weekend that he tried to short them at open Thursday. I straight told him that was dumb. *Just because in hindsight it was right, at the time it wasn't*. No one knew what would happen midmorning that effectively destroyed all buy side momentum and left the sell side wide open. Not to mention the hype then built on Thursday going into Friday by politicians, activists, billionaires... Then going into the weekend, news was splattered all over on every spectrum.

I know /Investing and /Stocks are generally not into this mentality. But I'm just saying, this was nothing like a normal trading situation for the majority of people. Everyone risked what they could risk to 'go to the moon'. Can't beat yourself up for treating a gamble like a gamble. People jumping late were buying lotto tickets for a MOASS. Sad to say, it happened and got cut short with Thursday's actions, at least that's what I think.

In the end, we all have to open our eyes to our own DD. By mid Monday I figured what was happening but held on just to see if there's any new momentum. There wasn't. I started really looking at the volume and stock movements, and you see how it dipped and rode back up daily - that could have indeed be covering. Trust your own gut when you need to. Don't take everything they say to heart - (such as the SSR and the incorrect way they were posting it. Same as the T+2, noone knows if and when they covered). Always remember - Other people's DD whether good or not, have personal biases, and this includes media outlets and analysts.

And just remember, a lot of the early adopters are holding because they believe in GME, not necessary just the squeeze. And made money along the way. There is nothing wrong with joining the ride or allocating an X% of your portfolio for risky plays. But understand what comes with that risk. **There is also nothing wrong with taking profits or cutting loose when suits you and your own financial situation.**

And I do think this was a great lesson for all of us, novice to experienced on how to handle FOMO, Risk, Greed, Emotion, Wall Street and the slew of everything else. 

**Decisions are always easier in Hindsight. Doesn't mean they were the right decision at the time.** Remember that. And don't beat yourself up on it. Take it and learn from it.

I couldn't have run Amazon as profitably as Jeff Bezos, but I could have written a MUCH better departure (as CEO) announcement letter.


It's disappointing that the leader of a company with infamously LOW employee morale would completely neglect to call out and thank his sorting center and warehouse backbone. Instead, he essentially announces his position change by telling those workers, "You're welcome," for the $15 min wage. 😩


Had he used the opportunity to rally his blue-collar drivers, pilots, loaders and sorters (who empower his bread & butter ecommerce & delivery service), in addition to the white-collar (SaaS/Cloud/etc.) "inventors" that he exclusively focused his letter on, he could have invigorated his workforce at a time they need it most. 


Attrition is coming! 


I rate $AMZN a HOLD, because while the profits are redonkulous, the poor working conditions and low morale will cost the company $Billions, especially when competitors resume hiring in a post-covid economy.

Can I put in money now and take it out in 20 yrs or they will have closed down or something? Does anyone use them here? Thanks a million._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Is there a downside to buying and selling the same security over and over again? This may be dumb to some of the more experienced investors.

50% of my money are in the "safe" securities (APPL, JNJ, QQQJ, VTI)

35% in "riskier" category such as ARK Fund, NIO, FUBO, ABML and so on.

what's left is my "gambling" money like I just used in GME. Now I exit my position (with small profit), I'm looking to invest back in some securities that I exited not too long ago. Example, I held PLTR for a month or two and when it reached the high last week, I sold it at $40. Now that it's down at 32, I'm looking to jump back in again and re-sell it around whatever I'm happy with and if it goes down, I might jump in again and so on and I look to do this with some other securities as well.

Question

Is there anything I should be aware of by doing this? Will my broker suspend my account, assuming I'm careful enough to not incur any trading violations?

Some of you might be in the know regarding this branch of the military, it’s easy to mock it and politicize it but...we already had this organization existing within the Air Force, it’s nothing new, it’s just scaled up from the past. So why shouldn’t we be able to invest in it just like we can invest war bonds..also, we already pay for military excessive spending through taxes, so why not make gains off of it._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ AMC - Why I'm Still Holding Don't mean to keep mentioning this whole squeeze thing, but I wanted to say my piece. I ended up buying AMC at the height of the squeeze (44 shares at an average price of $21.65) and I'm down a decent amount. However, I haven't sold since there's not much of a point in selling at the moment. Also, I believe that AMC will go up again. And no, I'm not delusional. I feel like there are a few reasons. One is that this Reddit frenzy could surge again. Even if it's not right now. Once these trading platforms ease up on the amount of shares we can buy, coupled with the low price of the stock, and also a LOT of scorned Redditors and investors in general, someone may just hatch a plan to try driving the stock price up again out of spite. Not saying it'll happen next week, but it could very well happen at some point. Another reason is that many people believe that AMC has potential to increase its revenue once more vaccines go out and more theaters open. Again, I'm not saying it'll be the next GME or anything. I don't see it going up to $400, but I personally could see it going back up to about $20, which would essentially cut most, if not all of my losses.

Feel free to correct me if you disagree. I'm no pro at this short squeeze stuff and I don't know much about the financial outlook, but this is my take on it from a personal standpoint.

Edit: I want to make sure everyone knows I'm not trying to get them to hold or buy more shares. This is solely my thoughts on the stock. Also, I bought these shares with profits I made from other stocks, so I accept whatever happens at this point without trying to throw a pity party._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Aphria/SweetWater - Brews & Branding Brand Awareness - Aphria Brands on SweetWater Brews

I know SEA is not just a gaming stock, so maybe adding on it is a good idea (I.e. get more e commerce and fintech exposure as well)..but it has grown 400%+ within a year, which scares me a bit about a possible pullback

EA, dont know/hear so much about

ATVI, seems solid company,  and even pays a small dividend..but not sure about growth potential 

Unity and Sklz have been getting a lot of media attention lately (Specially Sklz, as Ark etfs started adding it), so very tempted..so I think these two  will be the risky ones, but with a huge potential payoff


I have a small exposure in ATVI (30@74) and SEA (15 @ 197). I wanted to put in additional 10 to 15k on gaming related stocks and sort of create my own gaming ETF. Which of the above do you recommend adding?  Shall I just add on Atvi and SEA,  or dip my feet into the others I mentioned above?

Edit: as I am based in EU, I can't invest in gaming ETFs like Betz and Hero.. if you know European based ones, please let me know_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ I honestly think Jim Cramer was right when he said "You've already won. Just take your profits and leave. Don't try to go for the homerun." I remember when this news article came out, people accused Cramer of siding with his hedge fund buddies, and that he was a "piece of crap" for doing so.

But when I look back at the previous videos of Cramer, it seems like he was rooting for WSB the whole time, and even defended them and started the whole "we like the stock" meme.

Now that I think about it I think he might've been right. 

Wall Street isn't some conglomerate. There are probably other hedge funds who haven't **shorted** gamestop. Who instantly saw blood in the water, with access to tons of data and more sophisticated tools to get a clearer picture of sentiment. Knowing that a horde of emotional retail investors, were mass buying and holding GME. So they decided to ride the wave,  and now it's possible that they're pulling out, leaving the retail investor as the one holding the bag.

The company produces non-addictive pain relief drugs. They just closed an offering today at $10.50 per share, and is currently trading below that at $10. 
It also has an insanely low float at 998K, so it could be very volatile and prone to suspension. I threw some money into it today and I’m going to see if it flies either tomorrow morning or afternoon. I get the impression with a bit is volume this thing could take off. Anyways, what are your thoughts?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ I went from being super proud of me to being disgusted of myself in just 2 months Just by reading the title you know what this is about. I lost money to AMC, GME. Not anywhere near people I see in WSB, but right now, I am down $1500. I know this is loose change for a lot of you and honestly, it's not an amount that's going to put me on the street or anything,  but it was my summer earnings that I saved for a trip to New York and cities around (I am from Canada). 

I am a business student, currently in University and investment finance always seemed very interesting and fascinating to me. So, since Canada banned non-essential travels between US/Canada borders, I was left with vacation money which was around 3000 USD. 

Instead of putting it in a savings account, I decided to finally start investing. I was using subs like r/stocks, r/personalfinance, r/personalfinancecanada for forums and was doing my own market research (the best somebody can do with little knowledge), learning, and was super excited to finally find a sector I wanted to invest in. Renewable Energy. I invested all of my $3000 in $PLUG, $FCELL and the rest in companies that are safe like $AAPL, $WELL. It was fantastic. In just around 2 months, I made over 40% on my 3000$ capital and I was really proud of myself. I was motivated to do more research, learn more, and I felt good about myself (University grades were great, potential internships coming soon hopefully), it was just perfect. 

And then the GME, AMC thing started. So much contents, memes, to the moon post, that at one point, I completely lost my common sense, my rational part of the brain stopped working, I went from speaking like a normal person to... You know what I am talking about. My emoji recommendation changed to the rocket, diamonds, it's like I completely lost myself into a wild cocaine party full of booze and tequila marijuana smoothie with mushroom garnitures and I drank them all and decided to become a R... (As they say).

My senses came back today morning once I finally noticed what I had actually done, and realized how much I went against all the single concepts and fundamentals I used to start trading. 

I am still holding, because well, market's closed but I seriously don't know what to do. Good companies go back up. Gamestop has nothing backing itself up except rumours of a potential short saueeze and faith of millions who went all in. 


It's not the $3000 (net) that's bothering me, it's just that, I started out like a normal person who was doing amazing and got turned into a cult member. I am not hating into anybody of WSB, I don't even blame them. I blame my own judgement. I learnt my lesson but then again, it's not like I didn't know what I was getting into. It was mostly stupidity and greed I think.

Yes, before you say it, they’re not eye candy. But one thing they have is their incredibly low price tag (less than $10,000 depending on state rebates) and their convenience. Videos on facebook show how technically advanced they are, which will definitely attract their target audience. They’re also developing battery swap technology, which seems very promising. Honestly, their business model, which revolves around ridesharing is genius with the rise in popularity of evs.

Now for the DD. Yes, there are law firms ambulance chasing as a result of a false short report written by hindenburg ( similar to what Culper did to Blink), but their search for a lead plaintiff ends on the 9th and for anybody who’s been around long enough, it is obvious nothing will come out of it. Now for the good news, while Kandi received certification in California and Texas, The Agricultural Bank of China has provided Kandi with the financial backing to go through with its “ 300000 vehicle within 5 years rideshare program” ($76.5 million line of credit). In other words, they will not let this fail, nor would they invest in a “fluke”. 

Let me know what you think, but im holding a long position on Kandi, i’d like to hear your opinions.

This was NIO’s 6th consecutive month of sales growth, and they’ve now delivered 82,866 vehicles. They continue to outperform Xpeng and Li Auto, BUT are still trailing behind Papa Elon. So who gives a shit? *YOU should.* 💦😩

NIO is *only up 5%* over the past month, lagging and consolidating behind the broader market. Despite the fantastic delivery numbers AND the corresponding increase in EV market share, the share price DROPPED 2% today. Reminder that Pooh Bear J-Ping wants **25% of all new cars sold in the country to be electric by 2025**. NIO’s continual market share growth into *the* largest EV market in the world is literally an unmatched opportunity, with China’s EV sales [expected to top 1.8 MILLION THIS YEAR](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/upcoming-catalyst-could-move-chinese-213553234.html). It has almost completely retraced it’s price back to it’s pre-NIO Day levels, suggesting that it’s ready for a breakout. No, literally [go look at it’s chart right now.](https://imgur.com/a/dtPsHVb)

In addition to deliveries, NIO is rumored to be looking to **expand into Europe** with it’s SUVs. *THIS MAY BE THE LAST ENTRY POINT BEFORE THE RUN-UP AFTER EUROPE EXPANSION PLANS* They’ve also recently released their first sedan model and are expanding their Battery as a Service infrastructure throughout China.

I think that the reason the Meme Stocks have been plummeting is because people invested money that they could not afford to lose, and would otherwise have never been invested into the market.

The infamous Meme Stocks of the last week would have never bubbled up to such a frothy level if not for these brash, uninformed, opportunistic, and unwise investing decisions. 

The stock market is dangerous. It’s not our world, us retail investors. The hedge funds are run by people like us, but unlike us, they have been trading for decades. To complain that it’s a rigged game is like complaining that the house always wins in a casino. It’s just part of the game, unfortunately.

Thank you I’m advance_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Go or stay? What do I do? I need advice from somebody more experienced. So last week I started up a certain investment account when I saw all the hubbub and thought I would get in on some of the fun.  I always played around with investing with virtual stock apps and used play money.  This time I decided to pull the trigger to use real money and opened an account, dropped a measly $400 in it to do some light meme investing on some of the hot topic stocks at the time.  Thinking I could make a few hundred dollars, nothing big really.  As soon as I made some buys for the opening bell, the investment company I was going through, shut off the spigot and everything tanked and it hasn't come back up since.  As soon as I saw what was happening, I opened up an account with a more reputable company to do my investing because I was appalled with the company I am currently using handling of the situation.  I have the bulk of what little money I have in investments in said company, hoping I might walk away not completely screwed.  I should count myself lucky, I only lost half of what I put in so far.  Used $200 for actually investing and saved $200 for anything else I decided to throw in on when the opportunity arose.  In all actuality, I'm only down $100.  Now I am just waiting for my transfer from my bank to clear so I can sell my shares, pull out, and do some real investing with the more reputable company and leave the dumb meme investing behind and count my losses towards "stupid tax".  


Then I got to thinking.  Am I cutting my nose off to spite my face?  Maybe I should stay with the company I joined first and try and do some actual investing to make up for my losses.  Am I letting my conscience and moral compass get in the way because of my naivety?  I am just not sure as to what to do.  So, I figured I would ask those that have more experience than me.  If you were in my shoes, what would you do?  Sorry if some of this is confusing._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ What does being on the short sale restriction list mean for GME tomorrow? TLDR: probably nothing lol

I'm starting to feel like a bot when I repeat myself about this, so I'll just make a post instead.

---

##What is it?

"Short sale restriction" does not mean short selling isn't allowed. It's a restriction on how exactly you can short sell. It means short sale orders need to follow the [alternative uptick rule](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/uptickrule.asp). If the current best bid is $1, a short sale order has to be $1.01 or higher. In other words, somebody has to meet the ask, the short seller can't meet the bid. The idea is short sells have to be an uptick in the price.

---

##What triggers it?

If a security's price drops 10% compared to what it closed at the day before, the restriction is in effect for the rest of the day and the next one.

---

##Does this change anything for GME tomorrow?

It's unlikely, because the restriction's been active since Thursday. Wednesday's close was 347.51, and Thursday opened at 265. [It got flagged in 30 seconds](https://i.imgur.com/WU7gpbV.png). Since it triggered on Thursday, it was in effect on Friday too. Same story Monday, [triggered immediately](https://i.imgur.com/5DXmA0y.png) and was in effect all of Monday and Tuesday (today).

I have no position in Delta currently but will likely add over the coming months. As a side note, this is my first real DD, so any feedback or suggestions for how I could improve it are welcome

**Valuation and Competitors:**

On 2/2/2021, DAL closed at $38.80 with a market cap of 24.7B. In comparison, AAL and UAL have a market cap of 10.3B and 12.7B respectively. Delta shares outperformed both competitors over the last year, at around -31%, much better than the -39% for American and -45.5% for United. DAL also has less than 2% of its float shorted, which is one of the smallest in the travel industry and the smallest among US airlines. This is an indication of a bullish sentiment for Delta in the coming months. Before the pandemic, Delta was trading in the upper $50 range. I think it still has some room to grow, although maybe not all the way up to pre-pandemic levels anytime soon. It's worth noting that United has recently told their employees to expect furloughs and layoffs, which is something Delta hasn't had to do.

**Business Outlook:**

As would be expected, DAL saw a massive drop in passenger revenue, which was slightly offset by a 6% increase in cargo revenue. The pandemic resulted in premature fleet retirement for the airline. They retired 227 aircraft in 2020, shrinking the number of fleet families from 13 to 11. It is likely they will continue this into 2025 on a smaller scale, planning to have 400 cumulative retirements and shrinking to 9 fleet families. They've also reduced orderbook purchase commitments by 2B last year and 5B through '25. Admittedly, this doesn't sound great for their projected passenger levels over the next few years, but the changes are understandable, given that current projections don't have air travel levels returning to normal until 2024. They had a passenger load factor of 55% for the year, which isn't great, but it definitely could have been worse for DAL. Since most of their revenue comes from their passenger sector, a return of consumer confidence will be essential for them to become profitable again. Since January 20, federal law has mandated masks to be worn on passenger flights in the US. The support of the federal government makes it easier for airlines to enforce their mask policies and will hopefully lead to more passengers. The new administration has also signaled interest in helping to restore the health of the travel and tourism industry, although we haven't heard much about it yet. Increased vaccine rollout, the waning pandemic, and their commitment to blocking middle seats through March 30 should all serve to increase consumer confidence and get people back on DAL planes.

**Fundamentals:**

Cash burn was a huge problem for airlines last year. During Q4, DAL had their cash burn at 12 million per day, which was down 90% from levels in March. For the coming quarter, they are expecting to have a daily cash burn anywhere from 10 to 15 million. Currently, they have enormous debt to the tune of 27.4B. However, they made solid progress on paying it off in Q4, removing 6.2B of it. Year over year, DAL saw a roughly 20-25% increase in pension and postretirement benefits, but this can be easily explained by the amount of early retirement packages they offered to employees this year. This helped them to avoid larger-scale mass layoffs and furloughs. After a rough 2020 of negative EPS, this year is expected to be better. By Q3, they are projected to once again have a positive EPS, which is projected to be $0.25.

**Risks:**

It's still an airline stock. The industry is and always has been competitive, so that is certainly a factor. Beyond that, there is still a lot of uncertainty regarding the presence of new COVID variants and some agencies have warned that another surge could happen by March. That would be a huge setback to the process of getting COVID under control. However, if the vaccine rollout continues to go well, airline stocks could enjoy a nice ride over the next year or so.

**Conclusion:**

As far as holding period goes, I am thinking of holding until at least the beginning of fall to see how summer travel goes and if it becomes profitable for both DAL and the industry as a whole. Out of all the airline stocks, I think DAL is the best of the bunch and has potential for a huge boost when international travel restriction are eventually lifted. All of this is just my personal opinion, and I'm welcome to feedback or other airline suggestions to look at._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Stock news word cloud Does anyone know of a website or service that provides a word cloud of the most commonly used words on financial media sites?

At first I was in 4.5 shares @ $130 then bought six more yesterday. Now average of 9.927 shares @ $138. I saw the stock skyrocket to $480 dollars but decided not to sell. I also bought 34 shares of AMC.

I turned 18 in recent 3 months and was excited to start investing. I will be out $600 if I decide to sell. Tomorrow is my last day in these two stocks; I will try to break even, but if the price dips any further I am selling. I work minimum wage in a bar and am in high school. I work extremely hard for the money in my bank account, and I almost feel cheated out of my money. I've never been one to succumb to echo chambers but this one was different. A colossal amount of hype surrounding the stock and what seemed like hedge funds trying to cover their own asses - the perfect storm.

Only now I am realizing that maybe we aren't at the dip before the squeeze. The squeeze might have already happened. I got caught up in people saying that the stock would go to thousands of dollars per share. I was excited and decided to turn down the offer of walking away with an extra $1500 in my pocket. I will see how things roll out tomorrow and if I have to bite the bullet, I will.

$600+ is definitely a fine investment for the lesson I've learned in the past two weeks. I will be closing my brokerage account and leaving the investing to my older self.

Its like being on team Nestle or team Agit Pai in here.  Hedge Funds are definitely no angels by any means.  That being said, as much as I get a little schadenfreude watching them get kicked around a little bit, I'd argue that some of the anger is a little unfounded (or a little exaggerated) . Figured I'd try posting it in r/stocks since you might take an extra second to glance through. 

And before I'm called a shill, yes, I did work in the sector for a few years (not at a fund, but a company that works directly with them). I've since moved on to a new career and am less stressed and happier.  I just ask you take a moment and flip through before you call me names (although maybe thats a wsb thing)..

**Naked Short Selling has played a major role in manipulating GME's prices**
Wasn't sure where to start but this one is everywhere.  The main cause of this seems to be that short interest was 120% of the shares outstanding and how can you short more than all the shares? When you create a new short position you are effectively creating a new long as well. If you own a company with 1 share and I borrow it from you to sell short, the person I sold it to now has 1 share. If someone shorts his share, there's now 2 shares short. Short interest is now 200%.

**There's a massive coverup going on due to their being more shares traded than there actually are**
Glad this one is going away but it seems like the confusion stemmed from the 'synthetic' long created by the short. If this was an issue anytime a company got acquired for stock they'd be a giant controversy. 


**This picture of a bunch of 100s in a row is evidence of a giant illegal short ladder strategy**
Shares are typically sold in lots of 100. If you are trading an amount smaller (an odd lot) you are grouped in with other odd lots to make a lot of 100. Given that there are millions of retail traders sending odd lots, this is most likely a row of retail orders selling.

**Hedge Funds conspired with the app-that-must not-be-named to halt trading to save their asses**
Now this one will be impossible to sway some people without a smoking gun but those clearinghouse capital requirements are real & are federal law. It also lines up with what WeBull said (who doesnt have Citadel connections) and it makes sense that once it was announced they had received billions in funding, they opened it back up.
Theres a better explanation from Matt Levine at Bloomberg. 

This does not forgive them for being a complete mess through most of this.

**Hedge Funds are only for rich people**

**Hedge Funds and Short Sellers control the market and are the only ones allowed make money**
I find this funny because pre-pandemic, the narrative was that no one should be giving money to hedge funds simply because their returns sucked. The hedge fund index has been awful compared to the rest of the market. Anyone who threw money in an index performed better. Everyone has made money the last decade but hedge funds. And in regards to shorts, the market is at an all time high and short interest was at a 12 year low. They stink in particular.

Anyway that's basically it, with the markets becoming more and more accessible, HFs and their high fees are part of a fading business model. I'm sure most would short their industry if they could.

Ex-dividend date on Feb 12._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Quick question about the so called "ladder attacks" I keep hearing about Kind of 2 part question from someone who sold in the red, which I thank the people here cos I was only reading wsb and really was going to keep holding until I came here and started to get a second opinion that I set a stop loss, woke up today to find I exited my position.

**Part 1:**

So if you go to wsb they believe the drop in price is due to ladder attacks and they go on to explain how for example a couple of #100 shared are traded within very specific numbers and that because the volume is low these two things leads them to believe "short ladder attacks." I don't believe this because other stocks have similar # of shares being sold with also similar prices down to 4 decimal points. 

I am not taking sides but genially want to learn, how come the stock goes down insanely fast if the volume is low? Isn't this a "fake drop" or artificial price? Now I understand that with low volume the stock become much more volatile but how come the volume now is much much lower than before? Is it cos of RH restrictions? Is RH really the biggest broker around that them restricting people causes significant decrease in volume?

Personally do you believe the drop in GME price is artificially done by the hedge funds or the hedgefunds actually closed and left and now everyone else is leaving.

**Part 2**

Also in regards to last Thursday which many on here believe was the squeeze, just a side question on that, when the price dropped to $112 and then shot back up to $300+ is that because at $112 the shorts closed their positions and that's what caused it to go back up to $300+? As far as I understand when shorts close > price goes up. So it makes sense that on Thursday it shot back up.

Why didn't they do what they are doing now, which is synthetically drive the price down close a few positions but not too much so that they keep volume down and not cause price to spike. 

Do you think that's true? Like when price goes to $80 > they close more positions but not too much > causes price to go to $140 but again nothing crazy like to $300 while keeping volume low and eventually keep doing this, thoughts?

With that in mind, could this be an explanation? Like when we see price go from $80 back to $140 and back down is because funds are driving it down > closing positions > rinse repeat? If so then this would answer my first question which is that hedge funds are actually the ones intentionally driving price down, thoughts?

They essentially said that stock could be worth $140 and its trading at $20 ish. So this caught my eye. I decided to look into it a little. 

What I found is that the business model seems promising and their investor relations presentation seemed strong ( citron said it was awesome) their revenue growth is through the roof. 

Then I started to look at financials.. and I think I can start to see why it’s valued so low. Revenue growth is great, but their SGA cost was almost that of revenue. Their net income is -20 m, but I know for an early stage company that is not a huge red flag. But that SGA didn’t sit well with me, I understand that it’s something that can be cut. I’m gonna have to look into more detail of what that expense is. Btw HIMS, their SGA was no where close. So I didn’t understand. HIMS however comes out with SHE of 200m+, CVLB is negative SHE. 


Then to the balance sheet, very little cash. I get it’s a new company and they had good cash on hand growth, but have 900K of cash on hand. -SHE, and not a lot of assets. 

HIMS on the other hand, (which I’m using as the comparable as citron did) stronger slightly stronger balance because of a huge asset held in a “trust account” not sure what it is. One thing though is they have about 1.2m in cash as well.. and it’s not great. 

I was looking at the both while I was typing this and I don’t know if you can justify CVLB to be priced simulator to HIMS based off worse looking balance sheet and a big need for cost cutting. But I’m on the fence because growth potential is there and obvi, multiples are through the roof for the rest of the industry.. and that’s where trades are made. 

Last thing. I don’t love by stocks on huge run ups, but not sure if this is just being noticed and can be caught on the way up.

Now that the crazy GME and AMC furor seems to be dying down, hopefully we can have rational discussions of non-meme stocks here :)

Anyways, I was wondering what everyone's thoughts were on portfolio risk and the danger of putting too many of your eggs into a single basket. The backstory here is a couple of months ago, I came across a company (ReconAfrica). The company is rather small but they are likely sitting on tens of billions of barrels of oil in a previously undiscovered deep sedimentary basin in Namibia. Not having a background in the industry, I was initially a little suspicious and didn't take a large position. But then after putting in over a hundred hours of DD researching (including reading two books on petroleum geology to be able to thoroughly analyze the technical reports), I upped my investment to 20% of my portfolio. 

Fast forward to January, the stock has dipped a little in the past two weeks and I've DCAed up to the point where it is now 39% of my portfolio. The thing is, I have never had one stock occupy so much of my portfolio. I'm aware of the risks, but it could really be a life-changer for me if it takes off. Even so, I still feel like I'm breaking some pretty big investing rules with this one.  

It's basically unheard of for anyone, especially a junior to get exclusive rights to an entirely new deep basin like this, and I truly believe that the expected return (potential return)\*(probability of that return) is at least 10x for this stock. In other words, this is mathematically a no-brainer and the upside is so large I feel like the investment is justified. Or so I think. Thoughts?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ GME’s day of reckoning may be tomorrow So, GME has been added to the NYSE’s short seller restriction list, meaning that shorting it will be prevented.

* b) the shorts have not covered and the price of GME skyrockets, no longer surpressed through short ladders, as the cult alleges.

Personally, the chance of the squeeze being already over and the price returning to $45 for me is too great. I got out while I was ahead.

I am new to trading but I’m currently thinking of buying into NIO would be a wise decision. Since China is the leading EV market and admittedly NIO is one of the in my eyes leading companies. Could we have another Tesla here? 

Any advice would be highly appreciated

Edit: Bought 3 @ 55 and currently at a +5% so thank you people for telling me to buy seems to be about right_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Poke holes into my thoughts on margin. I know this question has been asked but I haven’t found a post asking about keeping cash on hand.


I have a $35k investing account, mostly in S&P, some In tech. 
I also have $15k+ cash in savings.

If I used somewhere around $5-$10k in margin at a 2.5% interest rate, and also put it into SPY/VOO while keeping my cash in savings,

wouldn’t it be similar to borrowing my own money at a 2.5% rate but while also giving myself the safety of keeping my cash to myself, and if I get margin called or maintenance fees for a bad market downturn I could just inject the $5-$10k from my cash and be safe until the market bounces back? What are the cons and risks I’m not seeing if there is any.

Thank you for your time._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $MGNI: Why it is STILL a great time to buy   

**TL/DR at the bottom**

This post unsurprisingly didn't get any love on WSB (No GME in post, but I do think the squeeze is still in play) so I'm posting it here hoping for a better discussion.

**What does Magnite ($MGNI) do?**

\- **World’s largest independent supply-side advertising technology company**. This means they help fill advertising space, primarily on websites, apps, and **connected TV (CTV)** platforms. Price per share at time of writing: $40.20

**CTV -** Basically anything that is not cable TV is connected TV. Connecting through your xbox or roku or apple TV or however you want to stream TV. This is the **primary source of revenue** for $MGNI. Are you on the poor people version of Hulu that runs ads? Those ads run through MGNI.

So let me ask you - is there a movement towards cable TV, or a movement towards finding other ways to watch TV through streaming services? I think you know the answer. And that is reason #1 to buy in. **As CTV increases in popularity, so does demand for advertising space, and so does $MGNI revenue.**

**Industry comparison -**

Trade Desk ($TTD). TTD operates on the buy side of ad tech, so while not exactly the same, they are within the same industry. TTD is currently **up 2800%** over the last 4 years, with a market cap of $38.5 billion. Where is $MGNI? A shade under $5 billion. Now is it realistic to expect MGNI to be the next home run play like TTD (who my brother sold for $50/share, RIP)? Predicting anything to go up 2800% in 4 years is unlikely but who knows. But **if MGNI can get to even half the market cap of TTD, that is a price target of $160.** (Current: $40/share, Mcap 4.75 Billion)

**Past/future earnings:**

Past earnings and future earnings show the story of a company with fairly rapid growth. Take a look for yourself:

Q1 2020 Revenue - $36.3MM, up 12% YoY from Q1 2019

Q2 2020 Revenue - $42.3MM, up 12% YoY from Q2 2019

Q3 2020 Revenue - $61MM, up 62% YoY from Q3 2019

*Q4 2020 Revenue - Expected $72-75MM, up \~50% YoY from Q4 2019*

**$MGNI is up %335 in the past 12 mo, am I too late to the party?**

Answer: **NO,** and although I already outlined some reasons why above, here is a list for you:

&#x200B;

1. CTV will      only increase in popularity, which is where the bulk of MGNI revenue comes      from
2. $MGNI is      showing accelerated growth, great for a mid-cap company to try to make the      jump to large-cap
3. Trade Desk      (TTD), who is not a competitor but is in the same industry, is valued      nearly 10x higher than MGNI.
4. Earnings      coming up 2/24, which I expect MGNI to crush, and I do not think that      earnings are priced in yet.
5. Needham      analyst Laura Martin makes MGNI her top pick for 2021, saying 500% growth      is possible (Jan 13 [Why Wall Street analysts think Magnite may be the      next hot play in ad tech (cnbc.com)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/13/why-wall-street-analysts-think-magnite-may-be-the-next-hot-play-in-ad-tech.html))
6. Survived a      short hit piece by Spruce Point Capital on Jan 8 (Thank you for a low      entry point for some calls)
7. **PR Today: Launch of “Unified Decisioning”,** a new MGNI product/software. From article:

*“Publishers are eager to tap into the efficiencies that programmatic provides without relinquishing the control they are used to when selling directly to buyers. Unified Decisioning enables them to do both and we’re excited to bring these capabilities to leading CTV publishers.”* Link: [*Magnite Introduces Open Beta of New CTV & OTT Solution Named Unified Decisioning | Business Wire*](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210202005138/en/Magnite-Introduces-Open-Beta-of-New-CTV-OTT-Solution-Named-Unified-Decisioning)

If you’re interested in companies that are trending from bottom-left to top-right, then I encourage you to invest in $MGNI. I believe it is a **good short-term play**; having just went on a weeklong dip from Jan 22 - Jan 29, I think you have a decent entry point here at $41.50, although I believe any entry point is fine at this stage in the company’s growth. Also in the short-term is earnings on 2/24 which I believe will be good for MGNI. It is also a **good long-term play** for reasons above, my EOY price target is $125, although it would not surprise me if it goes significantly higher. The $MGNI train hasn’t even left the station!

Positions: 100 shares @ $16, 2/19 35c x5, 2/19 40c x2, 2/19 45c x10, 2/19 50c x2 (Slight degeneracy)

**TL/DR:** MGNI is a growing company in the growing industry of advertising in (primarily) connected TV services (Think: Roku). Same realm as $TTD but 1/10th the market cap. Much room to grow. Earnings coming up 2/24 and Laura Martin’s stock pick of 2021. Just released beta of new software today. Not financial advice, I just like the stock.

Edit: MGNI acquires SpotX for 1.1 billion. (2/5/2021)

Where would I be able to acquire historic trade data going back as far as possible?  So far, I've been able to find sources that offer back to the early 2000s (NASDAQ, NYSE), but I'd like to extend that to the early 1980s (at least) if possible.

Open, close prices for the day would be sufficient for all stocks, though I'd prefer hourly prices if possible. Does such a thing exist and, if so, does anyone have an estimate on what this would cost me?

For those wondering, looking for a massive dataset for AI modelling, etc._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Story on how you made a fund 113 million dollars richer There is this fund called Silver Lake Partners, which was holding AMC convertible debt. Well, it’s not actually a fund, more like a PE firm. Anyway.

Convertible bonds are essentially like normal bonds, except they can converted to stock after the stock reaches a conversion price which is specified in the bond agreement. Essentially, I own 1 bond for 1000 dollars, and if the price reaches 10 dollars per share, I can convert the bond into shares and just dip (sell or hold). Sounds fairly easy, right?


Well, Silver Lake Partners was holding these bonds, probably super depressed knowing that they will be pretty much worthless if AMC goes bankrupt. However, here is where WSB apes come in play. They spike the price so much that the conversion price specified on the bonds is actually reached. Silver Lake can not believe their fucking luck, they convert the bonds into shares and dump it last week at the heigh of the bubble, selling shares for 713 million dollars, and making a profit of 113 million. 
This also triggers a share dilution which eases the chances of any potential short squeeze, and lowers a potential future price per share.

Moral of the story?
These people from San Francisco just got way richer and dumped their bags on retail investors. This is why it is bad to trade on emotions, you will inevitably help some of these people you hate, and be left holding the bag.

The only risk is that it immediately drops by over 1%, and doesn't return to the current price *for the next year*. On the flip side, the stock could gain and you could end up with well over $100.

Who’s going to report the big bust of the century? Come on news._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Frequency Therapeutics - Phase 2 Results Day Approaches Wanted to bounce some thoughts off of you all about Frequency Therapeutics. The company has been a star in my portfolio since September, and with phase 2 results coming it's an exciting time. 

**Company Basics** 

Frequency (FREQ) is a clinical stage biotechnology company headquartered in Woburn, Mass. The company has been developing an approach to battling degenerative diseases based around activating [progenitor cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progenitor_cell#:~:text=A%20progenitor%20cell%20is%20a,into%20its%20%22target%22%20cell.), with its main clinical candidate right now, FX-322 aiming to regenerate hearing through creating cell turnover in the ears. Essentially, the drug aims to regrow hearing cells that are lost when damage occurs -- up to this point, when you lose those cells, they are gone for life. That's why hearing loss generally sets in over time and exposure and is degenerative. Other animals have this capability to regrow lost hearing cells, but humans do not. Admittedly, it sounds a little far fetched. But [phase one results](https://investors.frequencytx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/frequency-therapeutics-presents-results-demonstrating-sustained), released last September, showed long term improvements in hearing. Through testing word recognition, the drug showed promise in reversing the effects of hearing damage. [Phase 2](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04120116) results, done with increased dosages and a larger sample of participants, are expected by the end of Q2 this year. The stated aim, per the trial, is to combat Stable Sensorineural Hearing Loss, which makes up the vast majority of hearing loss cases.

[Here is the phase one data, graphed.
](https://imgur.com/a/16h3250)  


**The Market**

As someone who suffers from tinnitus, admittedly this companies work hits close to home. Although tinnitus specifically was not looked in the phase one trial, there is hope within the community that by mending the underlying cause of most tinnitus, hearing loss, ringing will be mitigated. Beyond that however, there is a huge market for hearing loss medications currently not being served. 

Currently, if you go to an audiologist and are assessed with hearing loss treatment is done through hearing aids. While these may help one live a normal life, they merely cover up the problem, rather than actually treating it. Hearing loss is one of the most common problems that the Veterans Affairs office deals with. [Urban living](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/hearing-loss-may-be-caused-by-cities-noises-and-music-thats-played-too-loud/2013/04/08/3b0bdd50-93c8-11e2-a31e-14700e2724e4_story.html) has also been linked to hearing loss, and as cities continue to grow and populations urbanize this could continue to be a growing market. I think FX-322 has the possibility to really change how hearing loss is dealt with medically. According to market research, [the hearing aid industry alone was valued at USD 8.39 Billion in 2018 and is anticipated to reach USD 14.45 Billion by the end of 2026](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/11/09/2122531/0/en/Hearing-Aids-Market-to-Grow-Exponentially-and-Hit-USD-14-45-Billion-by-2020-Derive-Gains-from-Innovations-in-Hearing-Aid-Devices-says-Fortune-Business-Insights.html#:~:text=09%2C%202020%20\(GLOBE%20NEWSWIRE\),by%20the%20end%20of%202026.). If Frequency can disrupt this industry not only could quality of living be improved but a lot of money could be made. At present, there are no approved therapeutic options for sensorineural hearing loss.

Worldwide, 466 million people have disabling hearing loss. About 2% of adults aged 45 to 54 have disabling hearing loss, according to the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders. That jumps to nearly 25% for people in the 65-to-74 range and 50% for those aged 75 and older. Details on this, and a number of players, including Frequency, can be found in [this fantastic article.
](https://www.wsj.com/articles/cures-for-hearing-loss-may-be-found-in-new-drugs-11568599440)

The World Health Organization estimates the global cost of untreated hearing loss is $750 billion annually in terms of the negative impacts on productivity, healthcare, education and society.

**Financials and Distribution Agreements**

The companies financial position seems solid to me.

[The largest institution investors in the company include Wasatch Advisors, Perceptive Advisors Llc, Rtw Investments, Lp, BlackRock Inc., Vanguard Group Inc, and Federated Hermes, Inc.](https://fintel.io/so/us/freq#:~:text=Lucchino%20David%20L.&text=Ownership%20and%20Shareholders-,Frequency%20Therapeutics%2C%20Inc.,a%20total%20of%2027%2C594%2C671%20shares.) Approximately 81% of owned shares are owned by institutions. Blackrock, for example, owns 7.6% of the company. 

In 2019, Frequency entered into a distribution agreement with Astellas Pharma, a large Japanese pharma company. Details of the agreement can be [found here.](https://www.astellas.com/en/news/14841) [Frequency received an upfront payment of $80 million and may also receive up to an additional $545 million based on development and commercial milestones, as well as royalties on any future product sales in the licensed territory.
](https://hearinghealthmatters.org/hearingnewswatch/2019/astellas-frequency-therapeutics-agreement-fx-322/)
The agreement gives Astellas the responsibility to commercialize FX-322 outside of the U.S., with Frequency keeping (for now anyways) the U.S. distribution rights. I'm no expert, but it seems positive to me they were able to enter into such an agreement and have a large partners to help with perhaps the hardest part for any biotech, commercialization. 

As far as the stock is concerned, the company has a market cap of 1.6B. The current consensus 1 year price target is 53.67, with the stock closing today at 47.46. I think these price targets miss the biggest thing though -- the release of phase 2 data. If the data is good and further confirmation of word recognition provided, this stock seems to be at a crossroads where it is going to move greatly, either one way or another. I could easily see that price target being annihilated with good data.

[On Jan 19 2021, the company also appointed a Chief Manufacturing Officer](https://investors.frequencytx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/frequency-therapeutics-appoints-quentin-mccubbin-phd-chief). This suggests, to me at least, they are increasingly confident the drug will make it to market.  

[Details on debt and free cash flow](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/freq/financials/cash-flow) can be found here. The numbers don't cause me any concern debt wise, but you may know better than I or be more experienced in the sector.

**Competitors** 

Despite there being no treatments for hearing loss right now, Frequency is not the only company that is working on finding one. Other companies in the sector to look at if you are interested and wish to do your own DD include [Otonomy](https://www.otonomy.com/pipeline/), Decibel Therapeutics, and Audion Therapeutics. More info about the players is in the same article I linked [earlier from the WSJ.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/cures-for-hearing-loss-may-be-found-in-new-drugs-11568599440)

**Future Applications**

Beyond just FX-322 for hearing loss, what really excites me about the potential of FREQ is the applicability of the approach they are using to other degenerative diseases. If this progenitor cell approach works, as phase one seemed to suggest, it could be applied to other diseases like arthritis. Essentially anywhere humans have cells that refuse to divide. More testing is also needed to see if it helps with tinnitus. 

Please do your own DD. I'm not trying to push the stock on anyone, but I think it has the power to be a really impactful development in the world of hearing loss, and that makes me excited. If anything was unclear or you have any questions let me know, I've spent a lot of time reading about the company and think from an investment perspective phase 2 offers a huge opportunity to push the company further into the global consciousness and create a return, while also potentially upheaving the hearing aid industry along the way.

Been lurking a while and I guess with all this GME craziness I have more confidence. Anyways, I'm finally in a comfortable position where I feel comfortable investing into the stock market. I do have my 401k, but my wife and I have some extra income that I have convinced her to put towards investing. 

I'm still learning more on stocks, but I don't want to just go diving into it yet, but I also don't want to just lose out on money. 

My idea was I would put in probably $2k right now and then attempt to put in $300-500 a month towards the VGT ETF (Information Technology), it has seen great returns and they are invested in some great stocks (AMD/Apple). Is this a normal practice or should I try and put that 300-500 a month towards other ETFs or smaller stocks? I just feel the most comfortable with this ETF the others have me a little more worried. 

Is this tactic a good tactic or am I totally off base?

I currently have 6k to invest with. My goal would for it grow as much as possible. A specific goal I have would be to turn it into at least 30k in order to pay off my student loans. Of course I will be contributing monthly. The struggle I am having is with choosing an etf or with growth stocks, such as AMZN or MSFT. I have been eyeing SPY and vanguard. 

I figure some stocks would be better since they can beat the markets average return. I am sure there are many of you who have had great returns, so any advice is greatly appreciated. 

Forgot to mention I do have a portfolio that consists of AMZN, TSLA, APHA, FB, MSFT, and SBUX._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Thinkorswim Unusual Volume Scanner?

Can you please give me your thoughts on IFF? 

(sorry for formatting, on mobile) 

For me, the pros are:
1 - Completed merger with Dupont Nutrition and Biosciences. One of the big advantages of this merger is it allows IFF to offer full spectrum product development, with an excellent focus on Plant based nutrition. 
(without disclosing too much, plant based nutrition was the only segment to grow very well during the pandemic, and now tastes as good, or better than dairy based nutrition, so it is set to explode)

2 - Consistent dividend growth. IFF tripled their dividends over 10 years. See above for my expectations for further growth in income. And looking back, they have been increasing their dividend since the 90s.

3 - IFF has traded sideways for years, all the while increasing earnings / decreasing their multiples. They are an ignored, low volatility stock.

4 - There is excessive short interest, as far as I can tell (iborrowdesk.com and Ortex). To me, that means there is good short term upside potential. 

5 - ~25% of the outstanding stock is owned by the TetraPak family holding company. They are insiders in this industry, and clearly know who their customers are using to flavor the drinks going into TetraPaks.

6 - The flavor industry is technically complex, and there is very limited competition. And IFF has something like 3000 patents (serious, it is crazy complex, scientist with crazy hair level of technical complexity.)

7 - Their dividend percent is about a percent above the industry standard (think 2.5% vs 1.5%).


Cons:

1 - I don't know how well the merger will work.

2 - There are alot of shares coming "soon", but should still trade around the same value.

I already own 100 shares, and bought 200 Feb 19 $150 calls (because, wow, there was something like 160,000 open interest at that time point. Somone must know something, right?)_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Why do call and put options put you in the red even if your stock rises and falls like you want? I'm using an online option calculator:  [https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/calculator/long-put.html](https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/calculator/long-put.html)

When I play around with some numbers it doesn't seem to come out like expected.

For example, let's say I put in a call option for 2/12 for Amazon at 3400 (current stock price is 3380)

This shows me in the red at expiration unless the price gets all the way to 3500.

Why does the stock price have to go so much higher than the strike just to get a profit?  I know that it has to cover the cost of the option, but it just seems very strange.

 Is it because of time decay or Amazon stock volatility is low or high?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ GME Hedge Funds and The Dark Pools Read about Dark Pools. This is why there was no volume and the shorts covered. IMO

There's nothing about this anywhere in the media even twitter barely has any posts about Dark Pools. They are essentially a secret.

Try this, Google CNBC and Dark Pools. You won't find hardly anything, yet I've read (can't find the source right now, but there's one from 2017 at 40%)  they comprise almost 70% of all trades now.

We have no idea what we are trading because we don't know the facts of the trades.

I'm not a financial advisor. I'm a n00b.

>Dark Pools owned by the biggest names on Wall Street – such as Goldman Sachs’ Sigma X2, JPMorgan Chase’s JPM-X, UBS’ UBSA, Morgan Stanley’s MSPL, and Credit Suisse’s Crossfinder — have been **making tens of thousands of trades in the shares of GameStop** on an ongoing weekly basis.  FINRA, Wall Street’s highly compromised self-regulator, **reports the Dark Pool data on a stale basis, two to three weeks after the trading has occurred**. It is then lumped together for the whole week, rendering it useless in terms of monitoring price manipulation

>**One of the main advantages for institutional investors in using dark pools is for buying or selling large blocks of securities without showing their hand** to others and thus avoiding market impact as neither the size of the trade nor the identity are revealed until some time after the trade is filled. However, it also means that some market participants are disadvantaged as they cannot see the orders before they are executed; prices are agreed upon by participants in the dark pools, so the market is no longer transparent).\[3\]
