(Bloomberg) -- Sheldon Adelson’s Las Vegas Sands Corp. is exploring the sale of its flagship casinos in Las Vegas, according to people familiar with the matter, a move that would mark the mogul’s departure from the gambling mecca.

The casino operator is working with an adviser to solicit interest from potential suitors, and may fetch $6 billion or more for its Vegas properties, said the people, who asked to not be identified because the talks are private.

The portfolio includes the Sands Expo Convention Center, the Venetian Resort Las Vegas and the Palazzo.

A representative for the company confirmed it was in very early discussions about a sale and that nothing has been finalized.

A sale would result in Adelson, one of the world’s richest men, exiting the U.S., with his remaining casino assets concentrated in Macau and Singapore.

Adelson is chairman, chief executive officer and a majority shareholder of Las Vegas Sands, which has a market value of $37.5 billion.

The stock rose as high as 12% in after-hours trading Monday, after Bloomberg reported on the news of the deal. The stock had closed down 3.1% to $49.13.

See below for the financial model of the company to see how we came up with our numbers and let us know if you agree/disagree.   


**Financial Model**  
[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Elrv-kL2ofIPI1LJL5jh8TBFej4WXygkEQmZ1NSN63Q/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Elrv-kL2ofIPI1LJL5jh8TBFej4WXygkEQmZ1NSN63Q/edit?usp=sharing)

  
**Investment Thesis**

Sprout is a growing technology company operating in the content management industry. They have seen significant growth in revenues, with an increase of 75.43% and 30.43% in core revenues for 2018 and 2019 respectively.

We expect their revenues to grow at a slightly slower rate as the market for social media content software matures, and market entrants are able to take market share.

Sprout has been unable to maintain an effective moat, keeping it unable to reach profitability.

Thesis: Because of Sprout’s inability to differentiate itself through either product or target market, their spend on marketing and advertising will continue to outpace its revenue growth and keep it from profitability.

For these reasons, we believe Sprout is significantly overvalued.

**Company Overview**

Sprout Social was founded and had its first round of funding for $1 million in 2010. The product, Sprout 2.0, was launched the following year. Since then, Sprout has grown to nearly $103 million in annual sales as of 2019. 

Sprout has come about in a competitive industry and struggled to establish an effective moat. However, the brand is well known by users and potential customers. It is easily identifiable by its leaf logo.

Sprout operates as a content management system for social media sites. The site offers easy-to-use software and visually appealing dashboards and reports. Also offered is analytics for marketing campaigns on the social sites.

The software allows for content management across Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, LinkedIn, Google, and Youtube. It allows for post scheduling, engagement, and analytics across all platforms. 

Having a centralized location for all of these features for a marketing team allows for stronger review of the effectiveness of social media campaigns and easier collaboration for marketing teams.

Sprout offers its products on a per-user basis and opens up plenty of opportunity to upsell either additional features, or add on users. 

In addition to subscription revenue, Sprout also generates revenue from professional services fees. These are primarily implementation costs by Sprout’s technical teams.

The company has not done much in the way of finding a niche. However, it does have different offerings for small businesses and larger enterprises on its site. 

Sprout seems to want to appeal to all sizes of companies as it grows. Given the competitive industry, this may not be an effective strategy long-term.

**Industry Overview**

The industry that Sprout operates in – social media content management- is relatively new on the scene. Sprout was one of the earlier contenders in the space and managed to grow to a respectable size.

Like all those in the social media space, Sprout’s dashboards are sleek and their software is easy-to-use. Because of this, it’s had high user scores and customer retention.

These are definitely points for a higher valuation for Sprout, but there is nothing that Sprout has that is unique to them in this sense. 

All the points that Sprout maintains for strong user experience, their competitors do too. It is simply expected of the companies in the industry now, not a standout feature.

Sprout has many competitors, but their most notable ones would be Hootsuite and Hubspot.

Of these, Hubspot appears to be best for smaller companies. Their starting price point is much lower than Hootsuite at $50/month compared to Hootsuite’s $190/month.

Despite this, Hootsuite claims to cater to smaller and medium-sized companies. 

Sprout targets both large and small companies, but because they have not identified a niche, they are likely to lose market share to Hootsuite in the small business market with their lower entry price point.

Also troubling for Sprout is their lack of transparency. Of the three, Sprout is the only one that does not offer a minimum price on their website.

Again, this could cause a loss in the small business market. But it would be less likely to lose market share in the more sophisticated large business market, where potential users would be more willing to ask for a consultation for pricing and customization.

**Strengths**

Sprout has a strong balance sheet and cash position. This strength, however, points to a hidden weakness. The company is about ten years old, and in that time, it is still funded primarily through rounds of equity funding, not positive operating cash flow.

This means it has not reached profitability yet, and its cash burn reflects that. Despite the negative operating and investing cash flows, Sprout’s 2019 IPO funding should keep its balance sheet and cash position stable for at least a few more years, even if it cannot reach positive cash flows.

Another strength of Sprout’s is its revenue growth rate. High growth is expected for a new technology company, however. Its core revenues grew a staggering 75.43% and 30.43% for years 2018 and 2019, respectively.

**Weaknesses**

For Sprout’s weaknesses, we can compare operating results to competing companies to see where they may be underperforming in the broader industry.

Sprout’s gross profit appears strong, with a gross margin hovering around 25% over years 2017-2019. It increases slightly from year to year.

Cost of revenue consists primarily of hosting costs and providing support to customers on the platform. 

While this margin would be very admirable for a company offering a tangible product, software companies are generally expected to maintain lower gross profit margins.

For comparison, Hubspot’s gross profit margin is 19.26% for 2019. This leads us to believe Hubspot is more efficient in offering its products and services to its customers than Sprout is.

Hubspot’s average annual growth rate in its core revenues hovers around 30-40%. Although this rate is slightly lower than Sprout posted in 2018 of 75.43%, it controls significantly more market share. 

Hubspot’s 2019 revenues were $674 million, compared to Sprout’s $103 million.

Given that Sprout is significantly smaller than Hubspot, we would expect Sprout’s revenues to be growing at a faster rate than Hubspot since there is more market share available for Sprout to take.

This leads us to believe there are inefficiencies in the marketing department for Sprout that are hampering its growth potential. It also appears there are operational inefficiencies reducing its ability to improve its profit margin.

**Opportunities**

The industry is expected to grow at a CAGR of 14.1%, and we forecasted Sprout’s revenues at a generous range of growth from 50% to 17% CAGR over a ten year period. 

Sprout’s primary opportunities will come from the growth in the industry around it. The other opportunity it should benefit from is its age and the benefits that it affords. This will primarily come from its contacts at larger companies.

Sprout should see sufficient cross-selling opportunities in the companies it already transacts with. And the fact that it utilizes a per-user pricing model means that as a client of theirs grows, the more users it may need to license.

Customer build-up and increased user licenses means customer retention will be increasingly important. Luckily for Sprout, this is already one of their strong points. Out of 1,326 reviews, Sprout has maintained a user score of 4.3 / 5 stars. 

Customer retention should over time reduce marketing and sales spending, as this is such a large component of their total expenses. In 2019, marketing and sales spending represented more than 45% of total expenses.

Keeping this amount in check over time should significantly increase the chance of profitability.

**Threats**

Sprout’s primary threat is its inability to gain significant market share. Its marketing spend appears to be less effective than its competitor Hubspot. 

Hubspot expands its selling and marketing expenses by roughly 25-30% per year, whereas Sprout’s expands at roughly 50% per year. Despite this, Hubspot is growing at a comparable rate to Sprout even though it controls roughly 6x as much market share.

If Sprout is unable to gain more market share in a reasonable time period going forward, profitability will be out of reach. Their cash burn rate for 2019 was nearly 33%, and without more rounds of funding they could be facing a liquidity problem within a few years.

**Valuation**

We forecasted Sprout's growth rate at a rate from 50% declining down to 17% CAGR over the next ten years. Because of the information above, marketing and advertising were kept at a high CAGR as well. We then discounted free cash flows back to present at a 15% rate to account for Sprout's volatility as a young and unprofitable company.

This gave us a NPV of $3.23 per share, significantly lower than its current share price as of 10/22/2020 ($49.46).

Those sums would eclipse the $25 billion raised in 2014 by its former parent Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and the $29.4 billion of shares sold more recently by Saudi Aramco, in what is to date the largest-ever IPO.

The mammoth IPO, which spans Shanghai and Hong Kong, adds to an already frenetic year for China’s capital markets, which are enjoying a boom in share sales despite heightened tensions with the U.S.

Ant is seeking to raise about $17.2 billion in each city, based on prices of 68.8 yuan and HK$80 respectively per share, according to regulatory filings. Ant could raise up to a maximum of about $5.2 billion more, if underwriters exercise their option to purchase up to 15% more shares in an arrangement known as a greenshoe.

In a few years, Ant has helped change how people in China spend, borrow, save and invest. The firm, which has its origins in an escrow service for Alibaba’s e-commerce websites, now processes trillions of dollars in payments annually, runs one of the world’s largest money-market funds, and facilitates small loans to hundreds of millions of consumers and small businesses. 

The price values the Hangzhou-based group at about $313 billion, after including the new capital raised but before any greenshoe. In comparison, Mastercard Inc. was worth about $330 billion as of Friday’s close. A private fundraising in 2018 valued Ant at $150 billion.

Jack Ma, who controls Ant, said over the weekend the IPO will be “the largest in human history.” Speaking at a financial forum in Shanghai on Saturday, he said: “This is the first time that such a big IPO was priced outside of New York City, which we wouldn’t have dared to think about five, or even three years ago.”_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ A look at stock market history around elections and whether politics really matter [https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/26/a-look-at-stock-market-history-around-elections-and-whether-politics-really-matter.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/26/a-look-at-stock-market-history-around-elections-and-whether-politics-really-matter.html)

Does it matter for stocks who wins the White House? Is there anything unusual about the candidates this year that could impact the markets, regardless of who wins? 

For answers, we turn to Ed Clissold, chief U.S. Strategist for Ned Davis Research, who has studied elections and the impact on markets going back to 1900. 

This Q&A was derived from written research and an interview with Clissold. It has been edited for brevity.

***There seems to be a lot of confusion about this election and the impact on the markets. What’s your take?***

Part of the problem is that this is an unusual situation. The incumbent is in the middle of a recession and a big drop in the market, even though that occurred earlier in the year. I don’t mean a “recession” as technically defined by the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER); I mean that a large portion of the U.S. believes we are in a recession.

***Why is that perception important?***

When those conditions are in place, the incumbent is a serious underdog.  Since 1900, the incumbent party has won five times and lost nine when there was a 20% decline in the DJIA or a recession in the election year.   But the last incumbent to win under these circumstances was Truman in 1948.  Since 1952, no party has retained the White House when there was either a 20% decline in the markets or a recession, and both have taken place in 2020. 

***But isn’t this a unique recession?  This was caused by Covid-19.***

Yes. Because the cause of the 2020 recession is an exogenous shock, one of the biggest questions heading into the fall is whether voters will blame President Trump for the economy. Most recessions have a more complicated genesis than this one, and Trump is certainly trying to make the case that he is the better one to handle this.

***Is there anything unique about Biden?  He is proposing changes in the tax code on both a personal and corporate level.  That matters to Wall Street, doesn’t it?***

Yes. The main concerns we have heard from our clients is that higher taxes and more regulations would be detrimental to stocks.

***OK, you’ve made it clear the circumstances are unusual this year.  But what about the historical record?  Does the stock market do better or worse when a Republican or a Democrat is in the White House?***

The markets tend to go up whether there is a Democrat or a Republican in the White House. When adjusted for inflation, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has gained an average of 3.8% annually under Democrats since 1900, versus 1.1% under Republicans.

***Why is that?***

The President is not as influential on the economy as many people think. There are many factors that drive returns and who is in the White House is only one of many factors, including the fact that the U.S. is a capitalist society, where the means of production is mostly in private hands, and that there is a court system that enforces contracts.

***What about when one party controls both the Congress and the White House?***

When Republicans control both the Congress and the White House, returns have averaged 7.09% a year.  Under Democratic presidents, the market has risen faster when there has been a check on their power. When Democrats control the Congress and the Presidency, the market has risen an average of 2.96% a year, but 5.21% with a Democratic President and a Republican Congress.  

***What about immediately after an election, going into the end of the year?***

The market tends to perform better when the incumbent party wins than when the incumbent party loses.

***Why is that?***

It’s likely because the market often reacts to uncertainty, and a change in party leadership represents an additional unknown.

***Does it matter for that short period whether it is a Republican or Democrat who has won or lost?***

The strongest gains going into the end of the year occur when incumbent Republicans win, and the biggest losses when incumbent Republicans have lost, on average, likely because Republicans often positioned themselves as pro-business.

***Does that outperformance when the Republicans have lost extend into the following year?***

No. That relative performance has reversed in post-election years, with the strongest average gain in years following incumbent Republican losses. 

***So what does this tell us?  Seems like this debate about the Republican vs. Democrat impact on stocks is a lot about perception.***

Yes. Party control may be more about sentiment than fundamentals in most cases. Also, once the election is over, investors can focus on other things, like earnings, economic growth, or interest rates, so whatever sentiment-driven market action that occurs in the election year tends to fade and reverse itself._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Any stock charts with embedded dates on the chart itself, such as major news articles, earning calls, splits, dividends, etc?

I did an analysis on Goosehead Insurance, complete with a financial model for you to review how I came up with my numbers.  


Let me know what you think and if you think I'm wrong, I'd be happy to discuss! :)  


**Financial Model:**  
 [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17iieshL1WxZkmkuMljWQIWKlY6u4siJyC01S0JBuT6o/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17iieshL1WxZkmkuMljWQIWKlY6u4siJyC01S0JBuT6o/edit?usp=sharing)  


  


**Summary**

* Goosehead Insurance’s future growth rests in its customer service
* The P/E ratio is high but justifiable given past and likely future growth
* Goosehead has a strong management team focused on growth and investments in technology
* Valuation looks fair, but strong growth is still likely

**Past Growth**

Goosehead went public on April 27, 2018. Since then, their share price has climbed from an opening $12 to a high of $115.11. It’s settled currently at $81.64 after a retracement.

*This still represents an amazing growth rate of 580%.* 

I believe that not only is a high stock price growth rate justified, but it is likely to continue into the coming years. 

Since going public, Goosehead has had positive free cash flow and has been able to invest for sustainable growth. Major investments have been made into their team and technology for a competitive edge.

Seeing as they will be competing with major brands like Geico, Progressive, and State Farm, they will need a major edge to continue their growth.

**Customer Service**

Goosehead’s pride rests in its corporate customer service team. Its business is structured so that agents (franchisees) will be able to focus on selling and selling only.

All service calls are meant to be handled by the service team in Texas and dealt with quickly. 

The corporate customer service team is meant to be highly trained and compensated fairly to retain them. 

Goosehead boasts of its prize metric, Net Promoter Score. As their 10-K states, “We have achieved best-in-class net promoter scores for client service, nearly 2.4x the 2018 P&C industry average.”

The promoter score is essentially an internal metric that Goosehead uses, however it cannot be ignored that their growth is indicative that what they are doing seems to be working.

It’s important to verify Goosehead’s claims of superior customer service, since we are relying on it to project a high growth rate.

When looking over review sites, we found Wallethub had customer service scores for Goosehead and their competitors in the P&C insurance industry.

Goosehead maintains a strong 4.1 / 5 rating with State Farm the next closest at 3.8 / 5. With how competitive the insurance industry can be, even a slight advantage such as this can have a massive impact on premiums written and premiums retained.

**Future Growth**

Like many small cap stocks, Goosehead may look overvalued by certain metrics. As of September 2020, it maintains a P/E ratio of 224. This is significantly higher than many investors would hope for.

It’s important to remember, though, that as a small cap stock described as an “emerging growth company,” this valuation is heavily focused on *future growth.* 

Year over year growth from CY 2018 to CY 2019, Gooshead had a 26.32% growth rate in Contingency and Agency Fees and a 32.5% growth rate in its Franchise Revenues segment.

For the most recent earnings call (Q2 2020), the executives of Goosehead spoke of their strong growth rate from the quarter compared to the same period the prior year.

Total premiums increased by 41%, indicating growth is not only strong going into 2020, but actually accelerating. During the same period, their total revenues increased by 54% and their total franchise count increased by 49%.

Because franchising is a source of revenues for Goosehead, a massive growth rate in new franchises represents essentially a 10-year annuity from payments of the franchise fee. 

These fees mixed with strong retention of insurance premiums give Goosehead a strong ability to predict existing revenues and makes it easier for forecasting future revenues.

**Investing in Team and Technology**

While Goosehead’s primary revenue sources are meant to come from premiums written by their franchises and the franchise fee itself, the company focuses a lot of energy and money in its corporate teams as well.

Goosehead maintains a corporate sales team, where they invest strongly in education and training. The corporate sales team then trains the franchisees. 

While Goosehead’s revenues had strong growth rates, so did its investments in its team and technologies. As indicated above, Goosehead had a *growth rate in its G&A expenses of about 46% from 2018 to 2019.* 

Heavy investments in these areas is normal for a growth company, however. 

Goosehead invests in technology through a proprietary platform for its agents to use. Their claims are that it utilizes data analytics. Specifically, it indicates that it uses *predictive analytics*.

Goosehead claims it can use these predictive analytics features to guess which customers are most likely to be looking for new service so agents can focus their attention on them. 

Because the technology is proprietary, it’s not easy to find much more specific information on it.

**Valuation Analysis of Goosehead (GHSD) Stock**

Because Goosehead is already profitable and has positive free cash flow, it is reasonable to do a discounted cash flow analysis to determine valuation. 

We projected out Goosehead’s growth in revenues higher than previous years for the first year and then slowly declining. Also, we attempted to keep most other growth rates for other items similar to past performance and most slowly declining.

We used a 3% terminal growth rate and a 15% discount rate to account for its volatility as a small cap company.

Even with using a large discount rate of 15%, we value Goosehead slightly above its current value, but with a large growth in free cash flows. 

This leads to a solid expected growth rate of 11.44%. Again, we attempted to use conservative estimates, but more optimistic ones would give us a significantly higher IRR.

For a more detailed look at our valuation model, see the link below. From there, you can edit the assumptions with your own and verify our analyses. We encourage you to come up with your own numbers.

**Conclusion**

To recap, we believe that Goosehead’s strength is primarily in its customer service and investments in its team and technologies. It has proven to have a strong business model in its first few years as a public company.

As far as trying to value Goosehead, it appears Goosehead may be close to fairly valued or slightly undervalued. 

Despite this, if past growth rates are indicative of a strong future growth, we can expect that Goosehead’s stock price will likely also see a strong surge in future years.

* * *

SAP SE shares dropped as much as 21%, the biggest intraday fall since 1999, after the software company cut its revenue forecast for the full year and said it expects a fresh wave of lockdowns to hurt demand through the first half of 2021.

In a test for Christian Klein, who became sole chief executive officer in April, the pandemic will delay SAP’s goals for cloud revenue, overall sales and operating profit by one or two years, especially in hard-hit industries such as business travel, the Walldorf, Germany-based company said in a statement on Sunday. The drop in shares on Monday wiped 28 billion euros ($33.1 billion) off SAP’s market value.

The drop-off in SAP’s cloud revenue is a sign that companies are putting off making major decisions about updating their software, as the pandemic continues to limit any global economic recovery.

SAP said it expects limited growth and margin improvement over the next two years, and moved expectations to meet its 2023 strategy plan out to 2025. Klein said on a call Monday he expects a conservative recovery into the first half of next year.

The previous outlook “assumed economies would reopen and population lockdowns would ease, leading to a gradually improving demand environment in the third and fourth quarters,” SAP said in the statement. “Lockdowns have been recently re-introduced in some regions and demand recovery has been more muted than expected.”

The pessimistic short-term outlook from SAP risked a knock-on effect on the European software industry, warned analysts at Citi. Europe’s Stoxx Technology index fell as much as 6.3%, its biggest one-day loss since March.

SAP now expects adjusted revenue of 27.2 billion euros to 27.8 billion euros ($32.2 billion to $32.9 billion) at constant currencies in 2020, lower than the earlier guidance of 27.8 billion euros to 28.5 billion euros. SAP also said it no longer sees a boost from business-travel related revenue this year in its Concur business.

It’s difficult to find positive news in the results, Nicholas David, an analyst at Oddo BHF said Monday. “The warning on the mid-term ambitions was expected/feared by the market but the new ambitions are lower than the most pessimistic expectations,” he said in a note.

Qualtrics IPO

SAP said it is in the advanced stages of a listing for its Qualtrics software unit. It announced the decision in July to list the U.S. unit less than two years after buying the company for a record sum, a surprise u-turn signaling a strategic shift under Klein.

“We are well advanced in the preparations of the Qualtrics IPO”, Chief Financial Officer Luka Mucic said on a call Monday. “Qualtrics has had a strong quarter which will set it up for further growth into next year.”

New Outlook

Adjusted cloud revenue is expected to be 8 billion euros to 8.2 billion euros in 2020, down from a previous estimate of 8.3 billion euros to 8.7 billion euros.Operating profit will be 8.1 billion euros to 8.5 billion euros this year, down from expectations of as much as 8.7 billion euros.SAP updated its mid-term ambition for total revenue to more than 36 billion euros in 2025 compared to its previous estimate of 35 billion euros in 2023.The company sees more than 22 billion euros in cloud revenue and over 11.5 billion euros in operating profit by 2025.

Third Quarter

Third quarter non-IFRS operating profit decreased by 12% year over year to 2.07 billion euros. That compared to the 2.15 billion-euro average estimate from analysts in a Bloomberg survey.Revenue in the period declined 4% to 6.54 billion euros compared to analysts’ average 6.89 billion euro estimate.

Amazon:  Q2 10.3 EPS and projected Q3 7.27 EPS. Considering amazons bussiness revolves around (not exclusively but significantly) ecommerce/retail, AWS and streaming, why would their EPS drop  \~30% from the previous quarter? It just doesnt seem to add up. Their ecommerce has been running full capacity and is expanding to meet demands. Considering how Fedex smashed expectations, this should be an indicator of how ecommerce is still growing in pandemic. Did tech companies stop using AWS (zoom didnt)? Are people streaming less? All of these factors make it seem unreasonable for such a decrease in EPS.

UPS: Q2 2.13 EPS and projected Q3 1.82 EPS. Decrease in EPS seems unreasonable for reasons mentioned above. FedEx smashed their estimates and EPS grew from an already high Q2 earnings. Parts of the world opened up their cities a little bit but parts of the world, especially Europe, are hit with second waves.

Shopify: Q2 0.43 EPS and projected Q3 EPS -0.08. Consensus estimate is not just decrease in EPS but a net loss. Even if earnings were to decrease, I dont see how they wouldnt profit from ecommerce demand and retailers forced to shift or create an online platform.

I know there is more than just EPS that affects the perception of earnings report, but for the same reasons discussed, future demand and growth for these industry should have a positive outlook._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ How does stock options affect the value of common stock?

I would like to learn more about single stock investing and how to read SEC reports, financial statements etc.

I have been investing into ETFs/Indexfunds for a few years, and while I am about 100k USD in, it does take a loooong time (I am 30). So I would like to take on a bit more risk but do learn first. I have been using Google and found some books, but not sure which ones are really good.

Books I have read so far:

Millionaire Teacher, Rich Dad Poor Dad, The Intelligent Investor (I understood maybe 15 % of Intelligent Investor, perhaps cuz im dumb, but I am also not a antive english speaker, and this one was tough!)

Thanks in advance_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Thoughts about gold? Anyone here invested in gold?

If so, why?

I'm looking at recent price movements and it just seems to track equities. Sometimes, it underperforms and sometimes it outperforms, but overall it just moves in the same direction. I'm not seeing any diversification to be had by investing in gold.

Is there a reason you're invested in gold over other assets?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ How can I hold foreign currency? (SGD, AUD, JPY, CNY) I am USA citizen I’m not sure specifically HOW I can hold these other currencies as a USA located person and citizen.

Is there an easier way? 

Is there like a brokerage account or special service that offers these to a US citizen in one simple portal?

This one will focus on Specific Clean Energy ETFs. I hope this post helps people who are interested in this topic.  
 

Before we go in, I'd like to share some potential Megatrends on Clean Energy:

1. 50% of the world’s energy is predicted to come from solar and wind by 2050, 7x the percentage in 2015.
2. $2T is the total investment needed by 2030 to implement government renewable energy targets.
3. Renewables are set to represent ¾ of the $12T the world invests in new power technology through 2040.

(Source: [https://www.ishares.com/us/literature/product-brief/ishares-megatrends-global-clean-energy-etf-product-brief-en-us.pdf](https://www.ishares.com/us/literature/product-brief/ishares-megatrends-global-clean-energy-etf-product-brief-en-us.pdf))

The *current* general thesis for Clean Energy plays heavily with the concepts stated above along with others.

One note to address before we go in is that these funds are non-diversified: when you invest in these funds, you are SOLELY investing in Clean Energy. Do not confuse this with global diversification, these funds are very focused investments and they all have under 100 holdings

This ETF is very globally diversified, the top 3 countries are Denmark (19.23%), Canada (18.05%), and Spain (14.40%) standing. The US comes in 4th place standing at 10.40% for anyone interested. This ETF tracks the ISE Clean Edge Global Wind Energy Index which is Market-Cap Weighted. The ETFs weighting consists of 66.67% 'Pure-Plays' (companies that provide goods and services exclusively to the wind energy industry) and 40% 'Diversified Category' (companies that are determined to be significant participants in the wind energy industry despite not being exclusive to such industry). Overall, this ETF focuses on the CORE components of Wind Energy.

Invesco Solar ETF *(TAN)* \- This one has the 2nd lowest ER out of the three standing at 0.71%. TAN contains about 27 holdings, the top 10 holdings account for about 63.62%. This ETF is globally diversified, the top 3 countries are The US (57.87%), Hong Kong (14.26%), and China (7.12%) This ETF tracks the MAC Global Solar NRG Index which is Market-Cap Weighted. Similar to FAN, this ETF also weighs itself through the concepts of 'Pure-Plays' (companies that provide goods and services exclusively to the solar energy industry) and 'Diversified Category' (companies that are determined to be significant participants in the solar energy industry despite not being exclusive to such industry), boosting weight for 'Pure-Plays' and underweighting 'Diversified Category.'

Global X Lithium & Battery Tech ETF *(LIT)* \- This one has the highest ER out of the three standing at 0.75%. LIT contains about 43 holdings, the top 10 holdings account for about 59.91%. This ETF is globally diversified, the top 3 countries are, similar to TAN, China (30.94%), The US (24.12%), and Hong Kong (13.22%). A lot of Chinese weight, please research this carefully. China is still considered an Emerging Market so this is a very unique weighting situation. Anyways, this ETF tracks the Solactive Global Lithium Index which is Market-Cap Weighted. This ETF is unique because it focuses on the Full Lithium Cycle which means it offers exposure to the Metal/Mining, Lithium Refining, and Battery Production Segments. This ETF is similar in some ways to Commodity Metal ETFs, keep this in mind if you plan on going further with this.

What I provided is very brief. If you're serious about Clean Energy, you must read each ETFs fact sheet along with the prospectuses. This will educate you on the field more and provide more crucial data for each fund.

The main difference between each of these ETFs really comes down to the underlying holdings, sector allocations, and global diversification. Analyze your Risk Tolerance and Circle Of Competence in terms of holding/sector/globality for each fund before making a decision.
