 Alternative Investment in Guns The United States is an aberration among wealthy countries for its permissive gun control regulations. US gun control is particularly unusual for allowing citizens to own military style semi-automatic rifles, also called "assault weapons." Democratic and some Republican politicians have been calling for new controls on assault weapons for at least the past five years in response to mass shooting events. For example, Joe Biden has promised to regulate assault weapons under the national firearms act, the same law that regulates machine guns. Up to this point, these gun control efforts have been consistently blocked by a Republican controlled senate, though based on historical precedent Republicans will not keep the senate forever. Democrats have controlled both houses of congress and the presidency in 8 of the last 25 Congressional sessions and it seems likely this will happen again sometime in the next 10 to 20 years. It is also possible that the republican attitude towards gun control will soften in the coming decade, which may have the same effect.  It seems likely that gun control policy in 2035 will be tighter than it is today.

The US uses an unusual legal definition of a firearm that allows speculators to make heavily leveraged bets about the legal future of assault weapons. Under American law, the only regulated part of a firearm is the "receiver," which is a small metal (or plastic) frame that holds in the other parts of the gun. This receiver is legally a gun, and buyers are required to pass a background check before completing their purchase. All other gun parts are completely unregulated, and online sellers can ship complete kits for assault weapons minus the receiver directly to buyers houses. For example, a buyer can purchase a stripped receiver for an AR-15 assault weapon in anticipation of regulatory change, and purchase a kit of remaining parts later if he ever wishes to assemble it into a complete weapon. Receivers cost between 2-5% the price of a complete AR15, which allows speculators to take a highly leveraged position on the future of assault weapon prices.

In the section below, I go through five of the most likely legislative outcomes for assault weapons and give the expected returns to investing in AR-15 lowers. On the 10 - 20 year timeline, I suggest there is a large upside potential (500%+) with a comparably acceptable probability of losing your investment. If you don't want to read through my analysis, I have summarized my conclusions in the payoff matrix below:

&#x200B;

Outcome, Expected Return, Probability on 15 year Horizon

No Change ,                                         , 0%  return,  Medium Probability

NFA regulation but no ban               , 0%                         , Low Probability

Assault Weapons Ban                        , +>500%                , High Probability

Assault Weapons Ban no Transfers , -100%                   , High Probability

Mandatory Buyback                            , -50% to +25%     , Very Low Probability

&#x200B;

Possible regulatory outcomes:

1. No change. The price of AR-15s and stripped lowers moves sideways and the investor makes a loss on shipping and transfer costs if they resell. This seems like the most likely outcome in the short run, but gets increasingly less likely as you look further into the future.
2. Assault weapons are introduced into the national firearms act (NFA) and the ATF continues to issue tax stamps for both new and transferred weapons. This would require buyers to pay a $200 transfer tax and endure 3-12 month waiting period to purchase new or existing lowers. In theory this disincentive will reduce the quantity demanded and will cause prices to fall in the short run as the market is flooded by manufacturers who tooled up to supply a higher demand. Prices should return to normal in the long run as manufacturers retool to supply the new level of demand. The benefit of this outcome is that the investor gets to keep the guns for personal use without paying the $200/gun tax, but will make a loss on shipping and transfer costs if they resell. This seems like an improbable outcome. Legislators who want to see assault weapons banned would be unsatisfied with raising prices by $200, and anti-gun-control legislators would obviously oppose it.
3. Existing assault weapons become transferable under the NFA but the ATF refuses to issue tax stamps for new guns.  No new assault weapons would be produced but existing guns would be transferable with a $200 tax stamp. This is essentially a reprisal of the 1994 assault weapons ban, and would place assault weapons in the same position as machine guns are today. The returns to holding machine guns over the past 50 years have been huge. The stripped lowers for semi-auto and full-auto AR15s are essentially identical,  but the semi-auto lowers sell for under $100 and transferable full-auto lowers sell for over $15000. However, the returns to holding a semi-auto lower after an assault weapons ban would be much smaller than the historical returns to holding a full auto-lower because the existing stock of semi-auto lowers is so much greater. Full auto lowers command such a high price today because there are fewer than 200,000 registered machine guns and millions of people who would like one. Its hard to say how many assault weapons there are in the US today because the number will depend on how legislators define an "assault weapon," but the number is probably north of 10 million ([https://www.thetrace.org/2018/09/how-many-assault-weapons-in-the-us/](https://www.thetrace.org/2018/09/how-many-assault-weapons-in-the-us/)). Not all of these guns would be registered with the NFA in the event of an assault weapons ban, but the final number would still be huge and so they would not command a price anywhere near an equivalent machine gun. That said, if prices for stripped lowers rose to just $600, as already happened in 2012, an investor could still earn a return of several hundred percent after transaction costs. This outcome seems very plausible, especially on the 10 to 20 year timeline.
4. Existing assault weapons are grandfathered into the NFA but the ATF refuses to approve transfers. This would mean the investor gets to own a large number of guns that nobody else can have, but they also lose 100% of their investment because they cannot be sold. This outcome seems slightly less likely than outcome #3, but still very possible.
5. Mandatory buyback. Gun owners are ordered to turn in their assault weapons for a nominal fee. This outcome may actually produce a slight profit depending on how the government compensates owners. Typical buyback prices are in $50-$100 range, which is vastly less than the price of a finished AR-15 but can be more than the price paid for a stripped lower. Lowers today sell for a little under $100, but last year they could be had as cheaply as $35. This outcome seems very unlikely because legislators considering a mandatory buyback would likely anticipate that a small but dangerous minority of gun owners would stage some sort of violent resistance.

I'm holding a position that I trimmed a few times, added it it a few times... and I'm wondering how should I calculate my overall performance on this stock. FYI. I use FIFO (sell my oldest shares first) So, here's an example:

**1. Bought 50 shares @ $30 ($1500 total)**

**2. Bought 50 shares @ $60 ($3000 total)**

*At this point I'm holding 100 shares @ $45, so if Price=$54, I'm at 20% gain (54/45). Easy*

**3. Then, I sold 25 shares @ $54**

*At this point I trimmed my first lot, so I made 80% (54/30) or $600 profit. And I'm left with: 75 shares @ $50. Because my avg cost went up to $50, my "current return" is 8% (54/50)*

**4. Price go up to $100/share.**

&#x200B;

My question is, how to properly calculate overall performance on this stock, after "**Step 3"** and "**Step 4"**?

&#x200B;

I don't know if I'm doing it correctly, but this is my way:

When I sold 25 shares in **"Step 3"**, I essentially got $1350 (25\*54) out of cost=$750. So my performance at "Step 4" (Price @ $100/share) will be calculated like that:

Realized gains: Cost=$750, Balance when sold=$1350 (Performance: 20%)

Unrealized gains: Cost=$3750, Current Balance=$7500 (Performance: 100%)

Total: Cost=$4500, Balance = $8850

**Overall performance: 8850/4500-1 = 96.7%**

We’ve all heard it before -  dividend growth portfolios lag the low/no dividend stocks/ETF in the long term. 

Not really looking to debate that. Let’s just assume/agree it’s true.

Has anyone ever done a calculation though (or know where to begin) to see how that would change if we allocate a percentage of the portfolio to a stable, high dividend stock/ETF - that instead of DRIP-ing into itself disperses its dividend equally to the portfolio, still skewed heavy growth?

Would that outpace a traditional growth portfolio or still lag it? 

All calculations always seem to be done with DRIP in mind rather than dividend re allocation to all holdings.

Per https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/18/in-its-4th-revision-to-the-sec-palantir-tries-to-explain-what-the-hell-is-going-on/: “One part of that complication was its invention of a direct listing with a lockup. When a company directly lists on a stock exchange, recent tradition holds that insiders are not locked up, which means that they will be allowed to start buying and selling their shares as soon as the company hits the market. For reasons that are known only to Palantir, the company decided to mostly block employee trading, limiting the float that can be expected when it begins trading.”

“Palantir will lock up about 80% of shares in the company, allowing about 380 million shares to trade on opening day. Eight million more shares will come on the market in November when certain restricted stock units vest for company employees, and other vested RSUs will also not be beholden to the lockup agreement as they come next year.”

Questions: 

1) 380 million shares refers to 383,609,647 in S1. Why does S1 list an offering of Offering of 257,135,415 Shares? 
******
2) I read "Our executive officers, directors, and record holders representing over 99% of our capital stock and securities convertible into or exchangeable for our capital stock are subject to market standoff or lock-up agreements with us" to mean current officers are subject to 80% lockup until 3rd trading date after Q4 results, around 2/17/2021. But based on Soros' statement and 13F, SCM sold 20%. Would 80% apply to former directors (his former employee?) or how else to make sense of this?

3) When would 68,149,214 become available to trade?

4) ANSWERED Given F-share ownership structure, Peter Thiel and Stephen Cohen (the software engineer, not the hedge fund manager) no doubt approved this lock-up period. It is not traditional 180 days, nor is it at all traditional in a direct listing. No doubt they would want to stabilize stock price with lock-up (no ECM support as with traditional IPO) but why time with Q4 earnings (realize answer is speculative)?

5) Why do FactSet and other sources list a float of 62%? Wouldn't it be less than 20% (B shares not traded until converted 1:1 and F shares never traded).

Let’s put it in perspective. The retailer’s sales totaled $22.3 billion in the three months ended Oct. 31, a $3.9 billion increase from the same period last year. By comparison, the chain’s increase in sales for the entire preceding fiscal year was $2.7 billion. In other words, in the third quarter alone, it had to figure out how to manage the equivalent of a more than a year’s worth of growth. And that’s after experiencing a huge sales increase in the second quarter. It’s an utterly herculean operational lift — requiring a rethinking of supply chain, inventory management and labor models — and it bodes well for Target’s long-term prospects that it was able to adapt to these conditions so quickly."

WHEN will the index (and active funds if they want to) buy Tesla shares?  I see inclusion date is 21st Dec.  So will they start buying now or do they wait till nearer the date??

The reason I ask is I have an S&P 500 index fund but I want to sell some of it as I don't want to buy Tesla shares at the point of inclusion as I feel they will be temporarily overpriced.  But I also want to keep the index fund as long as possible before having to sell as they start buying tESLA shares_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Any reason for NKLA to be rising? I own some. Actually I was able to get into a lawsuit because I purchased some within a date that’s allowed.

So if anyone else purchased NKLA recently there are contacts to get yourself into the suit. They told me expect like 20-40% in return. I didn’t put that much money in so that’s why I don’t care to tell people. 

The more people that get into the lawsuit, the more spread out the money goes. Lawyers will get 30% total or something and fees and so on

Talked to a lady in charge of that yesterday._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Is it worth to franchise in this case?  So there's a restaurant chain in my country which only operates in two locations. But the places are always packed with people and they have a big competitive advantage in terms of price. They are like Five Guys (menu with fries and unlimited drinks), but much cheaper. I'm sure each location has more than 1000 customers each day.

Where I will open the franchise is a popular location in a city with lots of students that look for affordable tasty food, with bigger surrounding cities. Also, there aren't probably more than 4 competitors in the whole city.  

When I called them to discuss franchising options, they asked for 25k Euros. What do you think about this price in terms of franchising? What are the normal prices in the industry? Do you think it is worth it to franchise?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Important PSA EARNINGS REPORTS

You’ve all seen the comments about them. You may have even written some yourself.

“Wow. They beat earnings and their stock fell.”

“LOL, didn’t meet expectations, stock still up 5%”

“2020: Company does well, stock goes down”

Come on people. I get that there’s a cynical humor that helps cope with an ever changing market, but these comments make it seem like people expect good news to always mean that a stock goes up, and bad news to always mean that a stock goes down. 

When will people realize that 1) most of the volume of the market is automated and algorithmic and/or institutional and based on deeper factors and 2) the stock market is way more complex than “good is up, bad is down.”

I think that maybe with Robinhood and free transaction trading, lots of lay people are getting involved with stocks and they treat it as gambling - buy before a big event, sell afterwards. They don’t realize that there’s mathematics PhDs running super computers that manage transactions for large institution firms at the microsecond level trying to figure out a small part of the complexity that beginners simplify into “good is up and bad is down.”

So here’s the PSA part: THE STOCK MARKET IS NOT AN INDICE FOR HOW A COMPANY OR ECONOMY IS DOING. It is an extremely complex entity that is influenced by that, but also driven by investor sentiment, government regulation and intervention, large and small players, etc. Quit it with the oversimplification!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ FOMO and Palantir (PLTR) Really tempted to to buy some PLTR today, maybe 100 shares.

On the one hand, you have the news of the vaccine, which could be the proverbial white knight for the embattled franchise. At the same time, you have the huge competition from streaming services, not to mention other theaters, independent and otherwise, and the delayed release for basically every major blockbuster. I also have heard that they are knocking on the door of bankruptcy and bleeding money. Their theater rental plan--from what I have heard--has been a huge failure. Nonetheless, if AMC can make a comeback, it would be a huge payoff for investors.

Fast forward 5 years and I find myself throwing tens of thousands around and people are questioning my sanity.

In short 

- bought 1k DND @ IPO = 10k gain (not realized / still holding)
- bought 1k Palantir @ IPO = 8k gain (not realized / still holding)
- bought 20k IPIX @ early june = 5k gain (not realized / still holding)

I'm worried about the next move = buying air bnb and a lot of it

Edit: thanks all!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ ant's antitrust problem may actually be an upside As you may be aware, Ant Financial's IPO was canceled pending further regulatory action. There are some rumors floating around that Jack made his public comments regarding regulation in the grey area of online lending on purpose. This is so that Ant can be "officially" sanctioned and regulated as a banking institution.

Prior to this, the online lending market is a grey area, with many other smaller products available. What Ant's doing is that they are setting up this regulatory action to kill off other current and future competitors - now you basically a banking license to do this business, and only Ant will have in the foreseeable future. Sure they now have to do things like holding more reserves etc, but they will actually have an effective monopoly in the now legitimized private online lending business with a huge regulatory barrier of entry. In addition, they aren't like the central chinese banks, which frequently are required to lend to certain projects (for example infrastructure projects) which are not profitable.

On the other hand, if Ant IPO'd as a fintech company without any concrete regulations, they are subject to much more regulatory risk in the future, and the down side may be much worse.

In summary, I think BABA is a good medium to long term play. The Ant "antitrust" regulations may curb the tech aspect of the monopoly but in fact allows it to become a banking monopoly (in certain markets)._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_
