 Trading is hard without some kind of mentor. I managed to successfully time the market and sold at the peak of a stock price. I knew it would go back down but thought I had to wait for the trade to settle before I could buy again. Lo and behold it spikes back up again and I'm suddenly left buying back in at a loss.

What if someone just started out investing in stocks and they don't have tens of thousands of dollars to invest in one stock?

I started investing in individual stocks 2 months ago. So far I have like $2k invested in 8 different stocks. I want to hold these stocks for the long term and i want to add even more shares of these stocks.

What would be the best approach if lets say I buy 10 shares of a company (because that's all the money I have at the moment to invest) and the price goes up 10-20% before I have the money to buy more shares? Should DCA and increase my average for that stock or should i wait until the stock falls below my average (if it even ever does fall that much...)?

Example:
I buy 1 share of Tesla at $400. I want to buy more but don't jave the money for it. Next month i can buy one more share but it went up 25% so now it's $500. What would be the best approach?

1. Buy and hope it goes up even more
2. Buy on red days only
3. Wait for a big dip and buy (maybe it wont, or maybe i wont have the money when it does)

Per https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/18/in-its-4th-revision-to-the-sec-palantir-tries-to-explain-what-the-hell-is-going-on/: “One part of that complication was its invention of a direct listing with a lockup. When a company directly lists on a stock exchange, recent tradition holds that insiders are not locked up, which means that they will be allowed to start buying and selling their shares as soon as the company hits the market. For reasons that are known only to Palantir, the company decided to mostly block employee trading, limiting the float that can be expected when it begins trading.”
“Palantir will lock up about 80% of shares in the company, allowing about 380 million shares to trade on opening day. Eight million more shares will come on the market in November when certain restricted stock units vest for company employees, and other vested RSUs will also not be beholden to the lockup agreement as they come next year.”


******

Questions: 

1) 380 million shares refers to 383,609,647 in S1. Why does S1 list an offering of Offering of 257,135,415 Shares? 
******
2) I read "Our executive officers, directors, and record holders representing over 99% of our capital stock and securities convertible into or exchangeable for our capital stock are subject to market standoff or lock-up agreements with us" to mean current officers are subject to 80% lockup until 3rd trading date after Q4 results, around 2/17/2021. But based on Soros' statement and 13F, SCM sold 20%. Would 80% apply to former directors (his former employee?) or how else to make sense of this? 
******
3) When would 68,149,214 become available to trade? 4) Given F-share ownership structure, Peter Thiel and Stephen Cohen (the software engineer, not the hedge fund manager) no doubt approved this lock-up period. It is not traditional 180 days, nor is it at all traditional in a direct listing. No doubt they would want to stabilize stock price with lock-up (no ECM support as with traditional IPO) but why time with Q4 earnings (realize answer is speculative)? 
******
5) Why do FactSet and other sources list a float of 62%? Wouldn't it be less than 20% (B shares not traded until converted 1:1 and F shares never traded). 
******
6) What are difference between shares subject to lockup and RSUs? 7 million in TechCrunch might refer to Long Term Incentive Plan 7,631,726 per FactSet. But wouldn't 2010 incentive shares be fully vested by now?


BIG PICTURE: On or around 2/17/21 (3 mons and 3 trading session after Q3 earnings release) what would be impact on stock?

Then again they approved lockup? I don't understand._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Investment History Asset Allocation Test Program Hi,

Since brokers ask for at least 50% margin, is there another way of financing? Perhaps shorting some low returns products but even for that you need a 50% margin. What are you using when you need more leverage? Unfortunately emitting debt like Goldman Sachs at a 1% yield isn't an option._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Cracks in MSFT Azure vs. Amazon AWS a concern? I'm betting pretty big on MSFT in the context of Azure for the long term.  It's second only to Amazon's AWS and still has loads of room to grow.  Google's GCP is a distant third.

I'm hearing now that with Azure's rapid scale has come growing pains.  Complaints of reliability and simplicity when compared to Amazon's AWS.  I'm not sure MSFT will be able to shape up in terms of quality (if the rest of the their software really is an example).  Anyone else in the same MSFT boat and feeling nervous?  Basically looking to assuage my fears..._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Easy / flexible tool to create custom stock screeners? Hi everyone,

Can anyone recommend an EASY tool for setting up custom screens?I use TD Ameritrade but creating screeners is too much programming for me without a particularly good guide.

I'd like to be able to "ask questions" like

"which stocks' prices varied within +/- 10% of their average daily price over the past 30 days?"

or

"which stocks' prices varied within +10% AND -10% of their average daily price over the past 30 days?"

Is there anything that exists like this?  


(not sure if this is an "advice" thread, so apologies if this is supposed to go in the sticky)

thanks_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Financial Instruments For Betting Against CLOs? I don’t want to make this post excessively long, in my mind I believe that financial institutions that have a lot of exposure to CLOs will see heavy losses in the coming two years, I’m looking for the most potentially profitable instrument that I could use to bet on this.

I was considering very long puts on both KKR and Apollo Capital management, in the event of heavy losses in the CLO field would these puts have a good chance of gaining profit? Would I have more luck purchasing puts on banks directly with large amounts of exposure such as Sumitomo?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Why does VXUS have more Japan than China? Looking at the allocations in Vanguard Total International ETF, VXUS, I'm surprised to see that Japan is the biggest holding at 17%. I would have guessed China based on GDP but it's only allocation 12%. How are the market allocations to each country determined?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Renewable energy etf recommendation? I’m looking for a renewable energy etf recommendation and would like to take a long view/long term position in renewables to hedge against some of my equities in big oil. I think they will be fine long term but I’d like to start setting the stage for what the world may be like in 20-30 years. Does anyone have a couple of etfs in mind or even individual companies that are worth investing in? I have a Schwab account if that makes any difference. If the etf has a stake in VWDRY that’s all the better. I saw some recent news on wind farms so I’m feeling interested in that. I do own some GE which shares some of that space too. Not sure if I should pursue that more at <$10 a share or move to something else that is strictly energy. If solar is better positioned I’d like to hear your thoughts on that as well. Thanks for your suggestions in advance.

Edit: thanks all!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ ant's antitrust problem may actually be an upside As you may be aware, Ant Financial's IPO was canceled pending further regulatory action. There are some rumors floating around that Jack made his public comments regarding regulation in the grey area of online lending on purpose. This is so that Ant can be "officially" sanctioned and regulated as a banking institution.

Prior to this, the online lending market is a grey area, with many other smaller products available. What Ant's doing is that they are setting up this regulatory action to kill off other current and future competitors - now you basically a banking license to do this business, and only Ant will have in the foreseeable future. Sure they now have to do things like holding more reserves etc, but they will actually have an effective monopoly in the now legitimized private online lending business with a huge regulatory barrier of entry. In addition, they aren't like the central chinese banks, which frequently are required to lend to certain projects (for example infrastructure projects) which are not profitable.

On the other hand, if Ant IPO'd as a fintech company without any concrete regulations, they are subject to much more regulatory risk in the future, and the down side may be much worse.

In summary, I think BABA is a good medium to long term play. The Ant "antitrust" regulations may curb the tech aspect of the monopoly but in fact allows it to become a banking monopoly (in certain markets)._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_
