If you haven’t read his autobiography, I forgot the name, and won’t get for you, it’s worth a read. 

He came from living in his car and betting on stocks. To be fair he was going to Harvard and whatever. (I read it 10+ yrs ago so I’m talking very generally). 

As he became a hedge fund guy. He was mainly long. Hated to go short. He believed stocks only go up (they do in the long run).

His show, mad money is based on people calling up wanting to yolo. This sub is a rip off of Cramer and you guys should pay some respect.

I'm pretty bullish on Fubo TV. Big fan of the platform personally that you can get normal live tv channels and streaming in one for way less than you can a cable subscription.

Even after a massive run their market cap is only at $4B, with huge room to grow imo due to their growth numbers of monthly subscribers (revenue up 900% yoy), the money they generate from ads that play on the platform as Fubo becomes more well known over the next few years.

They're also looking into sports betting which would be really cool as an interactive way of watching sports, and taking some market share for other sports gambling companies.

TLDR:  MOON AMC JAN 2022 $10c MOON (unless you're a real man then $22c jan 2022.)_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ GME 🚀🚀🚀 _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Sprouts Farmers Market DD- Calls Sprouts Farmers Market (SFM) is a healthy grocery store that has made healthy living accessible to shoppers by offering affordable, fresh, natural and organic products.  Their slogan is “healthy living for less”.

Over time they have been slowly growing and have around 356 stores and approximate they will continue to add around 20 stores each year (based on their last quarterly report). The CFO said that at a minimum they will continue with a “10% annual unit growth rate”. 

They are able to keep their costs low due to strategic distribution centres and they mostly self distribute their produce. They will be adding more distribution centres in 2021 to cut down costs even more and improve efficiency as they grow in scale.

Sprouts has had tremendous growth with an average revenue growth of 12.9% and net income growth of 16.2% per year for the last 5 years (including the last earnings report).  Their balance sheet looks good in terms of the grocery store business. One thing to mention when you look at their financial statements is that they had a sudden increase in long term leases and property plant and equipment (PP&E). This is due to a change in accounting policy and is nothing to worry about.

How has COVID-19 impacted Sprouts? First of all, they have had more sales and CEO, Jack Sinclair said “Our e-commerce business grew 337%, outpacing most e-commerce growth rates in the industry. We ended the quarter with e-commerce representing 11% of our sales. Our gross margin increased 400 basis points versus last year.”. However, the best part that COVID-19 has done to Sprouts is accelerate it’s 5-year goal of “creating a highly profitable, differentiated specialty grocer with a long growth runway”.  They have not had much of an emphasis on marketing, but have still accumulated a few millions of followers on social media. They have developed a strong brand that integrates sustainability with supporting farmers, their society, etc while offering lower prices on organic produce than any other grocer. 

With this strong brand proposition, they plan to expand their efforts on marketing since COVID-19 has accelerated their goal (mentioned above) and want to implement a loyalty program in the near future. Who doesn’t love more deals and saving money, right?

In addition to this, the CEO is relatively new (under 2 years) and has plenty of experience in the grocery sector with being an executive vice president of the U.S. Grocery Division of Walmart. 

With the current trend of wanting to be healthier and being “frugal” at the same time, this is another catalyst that differentiates Sprouts Farmer Markets from other grocery stores. 

Did I forget to mention that they brought in revenues of 6.231 billion and only have a market cap of 2.38 billion!

Apple now is having an insane run up because of this beyond stupid EV Gold Rush and will most likely dip again after as well.

For gods sakes don't be like the countless posts we use to see when people were more honest about how they made 10's or 100's of thousands and then lost every cent.

Will it sink below $120 in two days? _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Celebrating ARKG’s run _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ I Wonder What She's Getting?! _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ AAPL EV is good for Tesla **Unless any of you guys think that another electric vehicle company is going to be able to produce higher quality cars at a lower cost than Tesla which I think is exceedingly unlikely, then all news of competitor electric vehicles should be treated as a positive. Here’s why: **

For Tesla, **Dominating the electric vehicle market right now is far less important than hastening the transition to an electric automotive market.** Every electric vehicle that comes out , Especially if an Apple vehicle comes out, normalizes the concept and reality of electric vehicles for the American consumer. It makes them more comfortable with it. Big brand names with consumer trust like the legacy auto manufacturers and Apple instill confidence in electric vehicle purchases for the average American.  

**Therefore, if tesla can retain the edge and remain the best electric vehicle manufactured at the lowest price, they stand up from facilitated American adoption of electrical transport.**

Currently, tesla enjoys that very same status. Tesla reigns supreme within the electric vehicle sector right now. I think that is likely to stay… 

- The manufacturing advances they are making with the model Y (casting machine) and the cybertruck, (folding chassis) and The new battery design, which is designed in order to enable very cheap, mass manufacturing, are unlikely to be challenged by any electric vehicle competitor from a cost basis. Tesla is going to source its own raw materials for batteries for the most part, whereas their competitors are going to have to buy from third-party. 

- unlike other car companies, Tesla doesn’t have entrenched unions, it doesn’t have colossal amounts of debt, it doesn’t have an entrenched dealership network opposed to electric vehicle adoption.

- unlike Apple and other electric vehicle start ups, tesla already has brand name recognition, a Pan-American repair and delivery network

- Tesla technology lead to pack right now. People have been saying for years that a Tesla killer was on the horizon. Currently not exists. Tesla had the first mover advantage of moving from a luxury, to semi luxury, to main stream car in order to facilitate their growth. Other companies don’t have this luxury, they have to produce a car competitive with the model Y and the model3 immediately, but without the strong internal engineering capacity while having to source parts including batteries and components from third parties. 

**I genuinely don’t see a path to success for competitors outside of smaller niche market like small transport, vans, traditional truck designs, that sort of thing. I think Tesla has such a lead at the moment, that they are in the process of juicing the most out of capital expenses, their technology is so far ahead in terms of efficiency and cost, that they absolutely stand to benefit from competitor vehicles.**

In fact, I think the worst case scenario is that the entire auto sector ignores Tesla and continues business as usual, not normalizing electric vehicle ownership and letting Tesla be lord of a little kingdom rather than a prominent player in the entire auto sector.

One thing you guys need to keep in mind is that the current share price is, obviously, directly tied to future sales estimates. I genuinely think these are conservative.

Until now, companies have only been allowed to use direct listings to sell existing shares, which means their founders and early investors could cash out of their stakes, but the company couldn’t raise new capital."

"Now, with the NYSE’s new type of direct listing, a company will be able to issue new shares and sell them to public investors in a single, large transaction on the first day of trading, much like the first trade in an IPO. That could make direct listings more common since most companies go public to raise capital."

Anyone from the street care to chime in on this new development? Is this mostly a non event or are we to see a more speculative/momentum driven open on these direct listed companies?

I took some retards advice and bought some GOEV about a week ago with the expected merger coming up. I logged on to RH this morning and watched it go full send from about $19 to $24 within about an hour. I was waiting for it to make its way up to around $30 but then it started falling quickly and I was able to get out at around $22 (gain). I bought back in again at $19.

You know what better analysis of your customer/marketing/product/etc data produces? Better fucking results. Better fucking revenue. Better fucking operational efficiency.

So yes, the initial partnership announcements are gonna be fun, but just fucking wait until we hear those companies post a year later about how Palantir allowed them to grow their revenues by X, or cut operating costs by Y. That's all thanks to their software.

So we all know about Chargepoint and Blink by now - this can be reflected in their outrageous SP - both trading in the 40's. I currently hold both and will continue to hold for a VERY long time as I view this as a similar play to buying gas in the 60's and 70's. 

Somehow, a THIRD charging station stock has silently slipped through the rafters and is just now really gaining some traction (compared to it's charging station brethren). This is a company by the name of **EVBox**. These guys are the current charging station leader in **EUROPE.**

[https://blog.evbox.com/7-faqs-ev-charging](https://blog.evbox.com/7-faqs-ev-charging)

Not too long ago, the ticker mentioned above silently released the news and saw a parabolic increase in price in the afterhours of the market. This SPAC went from trading in the 10's to the 20's within hours. 

Now, this being a SPAC, everyone expected this crazy price action to correct itself and consolidate in the mid teens. But it never did. The lowest this dropped to was the 19's and then proceeded to consolidate in the low 20's. It's currently trading around $27.30 a share.

I UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS A HIGH PREMIUM FOR A SPAC. BUT.

I don't believe we will see it drop any lower than 25. The market is gradually finding out about this and- if it follows the path of it's competitors, Blink and Chargepoint, I believe this price range will be very short lived. You can argue that the SP has some major growth ahead as it becomes recognized as the major player that it is.

&#x200B;

**THE FACTS**

* **2020 Revenue: $85 Million**
* **Projected Growth in 2021: 72%**
* **Charge Ports Delivered: 190,000 (38,000 more than Chargepoint)**
* **Charge ports Delivered in 2020: 80,000 (48,000 more than Chargepoint)**
* **CURRENT MARKET LEADER IN EUROPE**

&#x200B;

The last fact is very important. These guys are the current leader in Europe for charging stations. 

They have recently announced a partnership with Chargepoint as well that will allow drivers to roam between the two stations.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I've loaded the boat at an average of 25.00 and expect it follow the price action of Blink and Chargepoint.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gq56ax8xR3Y](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gq56ax8xR3Y)

TLDR; So, once again, my main argument is that this is currently undervalued thanks to the massive spotlight on Blink and Chargepoint. I expect EVBox to have a similar growth pattern as the market slowly discovers this hidden gem. It's the current charging station leader in Europe and has an agreement with Chargepoint. I own all three. 

**Chargepoint SP: $43.18**

**Blink SP: $47.05**

**EVbox SP: $26.96**

TLDR – 1/15/21 $35+ calls

Is an online real estate marketplace. It acts as the market maker by providing
cash offers for sellers to take their inventory without a listing. It then
takes the property on its books and then sells it. They're basically an
institutional house flipper.

Since 2014, they've flipped [80k houses][1]. During 2019 it sold close to [19k
homes][2]. Revenue grew from $0.7B in 2017 to $4.7B in 2019. Read more in their
[S-1][3].

They listed on NASDAQ 12/21/2020 through the IPOB SPAC from ya boy @chamath.

## Financials

### Private funding rounds

1. 8/27/2014 – $10M (lead by Koshla Ventures)
2. 2/26/2015 – $20M (lead by GGV Capital)
3. 10/14/2015 – $80M at $500M (lead by Access Technology Ventures)
4. 12/1/2016 – $210M at $900M (lead by Norwest Venture Partners)
5. 6/13/2018 – $325M at $1.7B
6. 9/27/2018 – $400M at $1.6B (lead by SoftBank Vision Fund)
7. 3/20/2019 – $300M at $3.5B (lead by General Atlantic)

### Private debt

1. 1/24/2018 – $135M

Total private funding – $1.48B at $3.5B valuation.

### Public funding rounds

This is a little hairy, because it's a SPAC merger, but I believe the company
received $1B in cash at $4.8B valuation to complete the merger.

As of this post, OPEN was trading on NASDAQ at $29.42 with a market cap of X

### Margins

They have a 1.9% margin for the whole company, but various
individual markets have higher margins (Pheonix has 3.0%). This means there's
room for margin expansion. Let's say to 4-6% as per their
[analyst presentation][4].

## Valuation

With their 2019 revenue of $4.7B and a +159% compound annual growth rate, if we
skip 2020, 2021 should have $7.5B in revenue and at 4% margin we get $300M.
With all of the other bullshit P/E ratios in this stupid bubble market, even
though OPEN is currently not posting EBITDA profits, this is easily a $30B
company.

Mind you, the company is projecting $3.5B for 2021 and $6.2B for 2022. With
those numbers, it's more like a $15B company.

## Price Target

For Q1 2021

Conservative – $40
Autistic – $60
Retarded – $69

## Disclosure

I own OPEN shares and calls.

Full disclosure: I have a large open BB position that’s bled since earnings, so I’ve been watching the chart like a hawk 

I noticed today a large position of $100k+ worth of weekly 7.5 calls purchased. 

Open interest was roughly 8K, the volume on that trade was roughly 11K. Definitely unusual for a weekly play...

Now, there’s only one way to check if unusual options activity trades are opening or closing trades versus the open interest, you either wait till the next day for the trades to settle, or you check the stocks minute chart at the time the options were bought 

Look at the minute chart today for BB at 11:11 time stamp, there’s a huge volume push and stock price shoots up

What that means is this, whoever bought those calls exposed MM’s to $8 million worth of naked short stock positions. MM will always hedge, almost instantly in these situations, therefore they begin buying $8 million worth of stock to hedge against whoever bought those calls. You buy a call from them, they buy the stock. That’s how options work. Stocks randomly pump this way and then drift back to the days normal movement exactly what happened here. 

Those calls were 100% a buy to open trade this afternoon 

$100k is low enough to be an insider trading on info leak. Especially considering they expire on a short trading week. It could also be an autistic gambler. Someone knows something or someone is being super retarded. There is no in between here. 

It’s not a short hedge fund. Funds will not randomly hedge an 8 million short position with weekly contracts. Someone is betting big for some strange reason 

Remember when WSB was jerking off to tracking insider trades earlier this year that a private group formed to follow these trades? I was in it along with others and learned quite a bit about the mechanics of insider trading 

This literally checks all the boxes to be an insider trading on a news leak 

BB catalysts ppl are waiting for are either patent sales, FB settlement, more AWS IVY news... or something totally unpredictable 

Putting this out there just so I can say I told you so if there’s news this week. Textbook insider trade. Someone will get in shit for this, they were not discreet whatsoever!

Update: the OI on weekly 7.5c’s is increasing up to 16k. Is that you idiots buying these? Jesus Christ... If you’re going to follow this trader go further out on the dates to a month or something. Either it’s an insider and there’s news and you make money, or nothing happens and you can sell for minimal loss next week. These specific contracts are super risky you reet’s

Update 2: BB unusual options hitting tons of scanners now. Last time this happened, we shortly got the AWS news and pump. The flow was already super unusual for calls before I posted this but it’s picked up a lot since posting... I REFUSE to believe you idiots contributed THAT much.

We are going to 40-45, mid January. Originally was targeting beginning of the year because we looked like we were moving 50% faster than the run-up of NIO and about 100% faster than TSLA , now it looks like the moves are about the same as NIO, so a target of 40-45 to late January is a safer bet. This is why I told you guys to use 1/15 and 5/21 calls, because you can roll those with less theta decay.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9ayjurt9xr661.png?width=645&format=png&auto=webp&s=aabc196dfa12af7353fb341180c3630f7123f8d7

I rolled half of my 1/15 30 strikes to now 2/19 30 strikes with a slight hit (10% off purchase price) and increased the 2/19 30 strike position by 100%.  Basically increased total option positions by 50% to now 60k. Holding about 130k in shares.

I expect us to be pinned around 27-28 before Christmas, then we'll have another run up to 31-33 when the shorts unwind for the gamma pin on monday/tuesday. Then a pinning of around 29-31 before year end. Then we'll have a large rally for the first 2-3 weeks of January, maybe ahead or after the public demonstration of PLTR.

We are in a game where we push up the value of companies so they clear multiple market cap and liquidity hurdles to be included in various ETFs/indexes, these then create a base level of support, such as with NIO and TESLA, the ultimate of which is inclusion in the S&P500, then really there is not much to the game left. This is why i recommend you sell your TSLA and get into PLTR, because the game is only getting started with PLTR. In the meanwhile we have to contend with various antics of MM who are trying to make sure options expire worthless, which drive interim moves.

If you can't handle the volatility, just buy shares. If you are playing options, be very aware of option expiry dates, gamma positioning through max pain.

**Edit 1: Getting a lot of comments on insider selling post lock-up. It is absolute bullshit. I know you guys can't read, but its literally right in the S-1**

60%+ of the company is owned by Thiel, Karp, Cohen, and SOMPO (A Japanese Strategic who has a JV with Palantir in Japan), none of whom will sell major stakes in the company any time soon.

Out of the cap table about 20% is held by VCs which may need to liquidate due to fund life terms. Half of that is probably going out next year as they appear to be cross fund investments by all these VCs, the earlier vintage funds will have liquidation pressures while the later funds can wait. So maybe half these shares need to be sold in 2021 post lock-up.

Employee option is peanuts. The only thing being sold post lock-up is 10% by the three VCs (Foundrs Fund/Thiel, 8VC and DTS. That is nowhere close to 1 billion shares, it’s closer to 250 million shares or about 4 days trading volume, which is no big deal. They will be exiting that 10% over likely the course of 6 month/1 year, it won't even make a dent in the market liquidity. _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $LUMN - future of tech play with 10% dividend, large moat, Burry ownership We all know that Dr. Burry bought into Lumen Technologies (formerly Centurylink) sometime earlier this year, and there are some rumors that Daddy Buffett might be accumulating a position. Dr. Burry does his research, so what makes them an attractive investment?

Pros:

* 10%+ dividend (probably would be better off reinvesting though)

* Current dividend payout is under 40% of FCF, 75% of Net Income

* Interest rates to remain low, allowing most of their debt >6% to be refinanced

* Once another 30% of debt is paid down, can return to investment grade status and reduce rates to below 3% and continue paying down

* Revenues have stabilized in core businesses, recent growth in enterprise segment

* Leadership winding down unprofitable business segments, increasing profits QoQ even as revenue declines

* Huge competitive moat with fiber assets (including international)

* Biggest competitive threats (Starlink, 5G Internet) unable to replicate bandwidth and latency advantages

* 5G relies on Fiber backhaul

* Data centers and Fiber to Edge enable next generation tech

* Partnerships with Zoom and other tech companies show new path

* Insiders hold large stakes, including their CFO, Neel Dev


Cons:

* CEO (Jeff Storey) is a boomer who doesn't understand emerging technology, would rather milk the company for his own gain until retirement vs take necessary risks (this is the perception, please feel free to disagree)

* Huge debt pile from acquisition of CEO's former company, being paid down but dragging on the business

* Landline business dying, but still has to be supported due to government rules and there aren't any takers

* Never invested in a wireless service, missed out by selling to Verizon

* Debt repayment and dividend limit investment in R&D

Any opinions?

-With the house market being hot and Covid on the rise with possibly a new Covid strain (UK), I feel companies adapting and providing services that can be done virtually will boom. 

-Ark investments have been purchasing warrants before the merger and bought OPEN yesterday. Their weight is about 1.5% for one of their portfolios https://www.arktrack.com

-Currently, the stock is around $28-32. Zillow is about $145. I believe Opendoor’s business plan is better and more innovative for customers than going through Zillow, Redfin and other similar sites. 

-Some good google searches, I’ve found articles talking positive about the company and I believe this is a very good dip to get into just like PLTR before it shoots up in the coming days

Any more insight would be appreciated?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Why Gamestop earnings makes sense and this dip is the perfect time to buy. crosspost from my sub /r/GME_Stock EDIT:This DD was deleted a week ago 

For one Shorts love to meme this stock hard af, everytime there is a sharp increase they increase their short stake massively, usually in after hours there is a big increase in value coming from shorts being limited and no news but last earnings report showed how a normal fucking earnings call can put a damper on greedy yolos, Gamestop has been increasing EPS massively for the past 2 quarters by closing down unprofitable stores and increasing online sales optimization doing basic divison of the 250% increase in online sales and the 25% decrease in store sales everyone can see that online sales are a 10th of what store sales but another quarter of this means big positive news.

My final bull case for this stock is the fact that huge jumps in value usually result from catalysts and the best catalyst is upgradings of price action by financial firms this happened with nio multiple times and with xpeng, and i think seeing the profitability increase by 2x coming out of the coronavirus pandemic alot of financial valuing firms with see this and massively upgrade this stock based on it.

Will Palantir's Stock Reach $50 By 2022? _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Why a $150 price target for GME is realistic Today’s 25% move upwards was pure authentic buying. According to \[iborrowdesk\]([https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)), shares available for borrow did not change at all today. This shows 2 things.

&#x200B;

 Firstly, the institutional shorts like BOfA and melvin have yet to cover, yet are getting pushed further underwater. When/If the squeeze eventually occurs, it is going to be violent. This also shows that the price dips at the 19 range was not a short attack but rather weak hands profit taking. 

&#x200B;

Secondly, a big player is accumulating. Either it’s Cohen trying to increase his stake for takeover(he’ll have to report within 2 days), or another institution buying. Either way its bullish.

&#x200B;

Now, heres the important part. Take a look at this chart, paying attention to the red crayon marks.

Before every console season, some idiots start shorting GME, resulting in a mini short squeeze in 2008 and  2014. At its peak, it had a share price of about $64. Now, take a look at how much higher the short interest is, and how much lower the float (total number of shares issued) is. Accounting for the same peak market cap, this gives a conservative estimate of $150 if the squeeze occurs. Note that due to the significantly higher short interest, it may very well exceed 150 by a mile.

&#x200B;

Lastly, for the short squeeze to occur, we need to all stop being paperhanded bitches. stop fucking selling at a 20% gain when u can easily get a 10x gain. The more liquidity u give to shorters, the less violent the short squeeze.

NIO 12/24 $44C, 24 shares (Just added 2)
PLTR 5/21 $15C, 80 shares (Just added 10) 

Ok both these are taking a major dip, NIO at $47 and PLTR at $27.

Perfect time to buy. Said the same thing last week when I entered my $44 call, and when added like 20 shares of PLTR.

NIOs not going anywhere. Huge order numbers, PRC Green 2035 initiative, huge demand. Chinese are going to be proud to own Chinese brand that is as good as western.

PLTR... same... has chokehold on GOV and MIL Intel and IT systems. They’ve been at it for years. Special Forces were using PLTR when regular army was stuck with shitty DCGS shit, everyone wants PLTR now, and once they have it they will not go back to overpriced garbage. 

Anyways, neither of those fundamentals are going to change. Look for yourself for the bottom of the dip...IMO already happened and heading back up.

They announced a merger vote date, December 28th. This vote will definitely pass. CIIC shares are up to 30$ and have been stable in that area. Management at Arrival has voted in favor of the merger, so it's just a matter of waiting.

The vote is in 6 days. Once it passes, the warrants should jump to trade in line with the share prices.

I initially told you guys to buy in at about 7$/warrant (CIICW), they stayed around 6.50-7.50$ range until today, they're now up to 8$. The intrinsic value of these warrants is 18.50$ at the moment (30-11.50) This is a gain of 131% from here.

I've doubled my position, up to 4000 warrants this morning.

This is a pretty high likelihood of a double or triple in a week. 

&#x200B;

Another option: short CIIC, buy CIICW.

TLDR: Buy CIICW.

Vanguard is an autist confirmed _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ NASDAQ: FTNT **Irrelevant Intro:** I thought I'd kick this off with the first play I've ever made *entirely without outside suggestion or analysis.* That might make you wonder why you should even read this to begin with, because I am very clearly *not* a professional, but god damn do I love analysis and stock picking. 

**Actual intro:** Fortinet, no not Fortnite, is an American multinational corporation headquartered in Sunnyvale, California that develops and markets cybersecurity products and services, such as firewalls, anti-virus, intrusion prevention and endpoint security. I ripped that description straight from Wikipedia, but it's important to note that a hobby, not profession, of mine is cybersecurity. Over the last few months reading various books, content here, and yes, digging into technical trading too, I finally decided I was ready. The only problem was, I didn't know where to start- this is where FTNT comes in. 

**I need to be clear here, the analysis I did for FTNT was done at the end of November. It's been about 3 weeks since this analysis so the valuation of the company *has* inherently changed.** 

**Why Fortinet?:**

Ultimately, my decision to buy into FTNT came from wanting to invest in the Cybersecurity industry. Yes, there are ETFs for this that spread out risk over a number of players, but I wanted to try and apply the tools I've picked up to real world investing. As I mentioned, cybersecurity is a hobby of mine. It's grown increasingly interesting to me, but more specifically, it's grown increasingly *more important* in today's tech driven world. To me, Cybersecurity is 'the utility industry with upside' because of tech's reliance on it.

Because I wanted something *specifically* within the Cybersecurity industry, I looked into *many* different companies listed in Cyber ETFs or competitors within the space. Specifically, I want to call out Palo Alto as a competitor, but others such as CyberArk, FireEye, and others. It's also important for me to stop right here and mention to you that if you do not know these companies well enough, you will not recognize that they **do not** offer the same products and services as one another. Just because a company is in the same industry as another doesn't mean they operate similarly. 

**Metrics:** 

1. Cybersecurity Industry CAGR:  Somewhere between 8% - 13% over the next few years.

1. ROIC: 19.74% as of Sep 2020, but their last couple of years have been well above my mark for buy consideration. (GuruFocus)

1. Institutional Ownership: 71% of shares held by Institutions, 85% of float held by Institutions. FYI, this was slightly lower during my purchase. I wanted to note institutional ownership for the following reason: The less Institutional ownership, the greater the chance for a significant rise in price after proven profitability comes. (Yahoo)

1. D/E ratio: Pre-pandemic was around 2 and declining consistently. As of end of Sep, closer to 4. I can't imagine the D/E ratio not to drop off over the next couple of quarters. I wanted to mention D/E ratio specifically because of FTNT's in comparison to the rest of the industry. Because the industry is still tech based, high debt is *very* common. The fact that this company, especially 20 years ago, already has a successful track record of obtaining debt for higher returns is especially encouraging when comparing their competitors. 

1. PEG Ratio: At September's end, FTNT's PEG Ratio was .66, however it has increased to 1.16 as of today. Again, this is absolutely *insane* when compared to other Cybersecurity industry competitors. (GuruFocus)

1. There are many other metrics that could be listed here, both in favor of FTNT and against them, but the ones above are a handful that went into my secret sauce when comparing the company against its competitors. 

**Subjective Sentiment:** 

There have been huge catalysts that have helped boost FTNT recently. The COVID pandemic, like most other tech related picks, has definitely boosted FTNT's ability to outperform. The 52 week low of $70 was robbery and unfortunately I was too late to buy in at that point. My actual buy in price didn't come until the stock hit $124 but I'm glad I did, even then. About a week later, it was announced that FireEye was hit by a malware attack, which further exploded into basically what's being referred to as the largest cybersecurity event in the last decade and maybe ever. The implications are reaching as far as the US Gov't, foreign entities, and private businesses alike due to poor cybersecurity practices on behalf of the vendor SolarWinds. I'm not going to get into the details on this attack, but with every passing year, more cybersecurity incidents arise. Hacking is its own industry. Cybersecurity is its opposite. As the hacking industry grows, as does Cyber. This will *not* be a one time thing. If you are too concerned that you 'missed out' on a significant event and shouldn't even consider FTNT, you're gonna keep missing out on what Fortinet will continue to prevent against.

What I think is the most important piece of this short novel is the sentiment behind the company itself. I am not a FTNT customer, so I was unfamiliar with their level of success from the customer's perspective. How did I get an idea of the company? Literally just reddit. It sounds insane, but it was tremendously helpful. Subreddits like r/sysadmin and r/netsec was a gold mine for finding out how people feel about both Fortinet, Palo Alto, and other competitors. And guess what, Fortinet was all thumbs up. "Inexpensive and cheap" was the mantra. Palo Alto, you ask? The cream of the crop when it came to the specific solution both companies were trying to solve, but expensive as heck. Even after the fundamental analysis done above, I reasoned that *everyone* needs to start considering Cybersecurity as a part of their core business expenses, but very few but the largest and mid size organizations are willing to put out cash for the "Ferrari of equipment" from Palo Alto.

**Conclusion:**

I could go on and on about Fortinet. It checks all of my boxes and again, it's important for me to say that FTNT is something I'm going to hold for *a long* time. Their leadership is killing it, they're performing when others are still figuring things out, and they still have incredible room to absolutely crush it in the industry. Despite my position being up only 20% since November 30th, I'm absolutely stoked about the potential that Fortinet has in the future.

Please provide criticisms & feedback about FTNT because my strategy is based on examining all possible data & information. It may not be relevant to me now, but keeping it in mind as I move forward with holding FTNT could prove fortuitous if things change.

*- Initial deployment of 219 chargers will be located at 35 Pennsylvania locations*  


Miami Beach, FL, Dec. 22, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Blink Charging Co. (Nasdaq: BLNK, BLNKW) (“Blink” or the “Company”), a leading owner, operator and provider of electric vehicle (EV) charging equipment and services, announced today that it has signed an exclusive seven-year agreement with Lehigh Valley Health Network (LVHN) for Blink to own and operate charging stations across the health network's extensive portfolio of locations. The agreement allows Blink to deploy EV chargers across LVHN’s hundreds of health care facilities, including hospitals, health centers, physician practices, rehabilitation locations, ExpressCARE sites and other outpatient care locations. Under this agreement, Blink will own and operate the charging stations.

"As evidenced by the exclusive and long-term nature of this agreement 7-years with two 7-year extensions, LVHN is committing to making EV charging stations available to the medical staff, patients and visitors of Lehigh Valley Health Network. They serve as a model both in their local communities and the health care industry, and they should be commended for providing the infrastructure required to make widespread EV adoption a reality," said Blink Charging Chief Operating Officer Brendan Jones.

Now this is happening with $ABNB and it seems to be paying off only that I’m going to maintain some patience and hold for ~30 days. The next target is $WISH which just opened for options trading today. 

I know you degenerates hate straight stocks so this is possible strategy to consider your YOLO magic when everyone here keeps shilling the same stocks and you’re looking for something new: new indexes that recently make option trading available.

I do understand that $ABNB and $AI had unique IPOs but are still following the trend and these are just the general samples I’m using. Look at any new tech stock or any that act like a tech stock like $ABNB.

Checking the search term "Gamestop Playstation" lets you compare across years. What this chart means is that the search term "Gamestop Playstation" in Nov 2020 is about 400% larger than it has been since 2012. You'll note that the chart includes 2013, the year the PS4 was released.

The bump for Xbox is there but not as huge. It still does beat all of the last 9 years including the launch of the Xbone.

Hang on because this is where it gets a little bumpy. I have contended that COVID is damping down interest in going to GME stores in person. That's a tough one to tease out of this data but I think you can get a proxy.

First, searches for "is gamestop open"

https://imgur.com/a/rXAsSvt

That huge blue dildo at the end is a break from the past which would normally occur at Nov to Dec, this year it happened starting March. I think you can guess why. But why does this matter?

The next chart is "gamestop trade in" which we know is a big part of their business. You see a spike in 2013 when the last gen consoles were released. Then you see an even bigger spike the year after as people are getting new used games for the consoles they bought the year before. Then a long steady trend down, which makes sense.

Now pay close attention, when did this search term start to plunge way below its trendline, yes right as COVID started. I contend that COVID is suppressing interest in game trade ins and we will see a massive rebound when COVID gets its boot off our neck.

Potential alone easily justifies $10B plus (~$45 per share) right now.

It’s very rare that retail investors get a chance to invest in a company like this at $3-4b (VC series B or C level valuations) with breakthrough technology that fits the trajectory of the economy and government policy priorities so perfectly. 

Can easily see this as $100B plus company within 5 years. That’s 20-25x the current valuations. 

The positive tailwinds are extremely strong.

-Sells machines, software subscriptions, maintenance and servicing, materials, AI. All perfect for the recovery and phase of the economic cycle we are entering in 2021.

-Fits the ‘great reset’ narrative as well as anything out there. The flood of fiscal stimulus and domestic manufacturing capacity focus from governments worldwide, especially the US government, will make DM products and technology in high demand.

-Best in class technology and management team. Founded out of MIT with management that has successfully done industrial technology for decades.

-US government defense and national security agencies and contractors alone are multi $B revenue per year customers.

-Government customers across the world. Another multi $B revenue per year revenue stream.

-All industrial corporates across the world another multi $B per year.

-DM has climate friendly processes and focus which will be a major selling point for environmentally conscious governments and corporates.

-ESG investors will love what this company does and will add it to their portfolios once it gets on their radars.

-Rock star lineup of backers who are not selling for anything less than several times the IPO price. Guys like Chamath are looking for 5-10x returns at least when they invest in early stage companies.

If you’re looking for a multi bagger investment, DM is as good as anything out there. It’s significantly undervalued right now based on what it’s base case potential is. 

Frankly, it’s more likely they get bought out for a healthy premium given the mountains of cash on a lot of big corporates balance sheets. These companies need growth to maintain their lofty valuations and DM is an easy bolt on division that will produce tens of billions of high margin revenue in the near future.

It doesn’t require any mental functionality to guess who that is as there is no other American country auto maker that sane people of the rest of the world are interested in. The investment case with NNO is that there is a real chance it being bought by Papa Elon. Their cobalt-free cathodes are cheaper and provide increased performance what they‘ve already proved in the past. Right now the stock sits at around laughable 500 mio market cap.

In the following weeks I started buying some other shit including Wirecard. Then Covid hit but that did not affect my portfolio as much at the time.

After that the Wirecard scandal demolished my ***very diversified*** portfolio.

**\~Very Long Post\~**

Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let’s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw a very bad open after the UK [news](https://ibb.co/gRtBKsQ), but things did turn around as the big 3 indexes mostly recovered, with the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/PrY0RJx) finishing down just 0.10% for the day, the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/8gTGLps) even posting a small gain finishing up 0.12% while the [SP500](https://ibb.co/tppPJ2r) lost 0.39% dragged down by the recent addition, [Tesla](https://ibb.co/dB2pbc2), which finished more than 6% down for the day. We also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/0GHcjF4) opening very high and was up more than 30% at one point before eventually finishing the day around the 25 levels, as the new strain in the UK caused some panic selling and overreactions in the stock market in my opinion. [Here](https://streamable.com/832r8c) is a short-clip from the Admiral Brett Giroir, the US HHS assistant secretary sharing the facts on CNN yesterday, as there is a lot of misinformation going on. 

So, he gave us reassurance, and I don’t believe there is anything to dispute [here](https://ibb.co/8XmJ4PL), as I have done a lot of research yesterday on the matter, as this strain has been circulating for 3 months already and is not something new with the only point of concern being that this one is more transmissible and has become the most common in the UK. This should not impact the effectiveness of the vaccines and has not been proven to be more lethal than any other strain. So, hopefully the vaccines become more available as fast as possible so that we can get past this whole thing already.

[Yesterday](https://ibb.co/8N8qSgR) more than 60% of the companies were losing ground on above average volume, as companies have started to have some retracements to the 50-day moving averages. Only one of the 11 [sectors](https://ibb.co/z6P1DDX) in the SP was gaining yesterday, with Financials gaining 0.81%, while Energy, Real Estate and Utilities finished the day down more than 2% as growth companies outperformed the value plays [yesterday](https://ibb.co/RgBp7cP), especially the mid and small-caps.

Here is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/ncyyDVm) from yesterday, as there was a whole lot of red going on, with only the biggest tech companies in the world having some small gains, with Microsoft & Apple up more than 1% while Amazon & Google also finished barely up for the day. We Also got the US banks which did pretty good following the FED decision to allow share buybacks again and Nike also surging after terrific earnings. We also saw some of the biggest losers in the oil & gas industry joined by Tesla which saw a significant pullback after the SP500 inclusion.

Meanwhile, the US Congress finally [passed](https://ibb.co/4f0zbdv) a $892B bill after many months of gridlock that is expected to be signed into law by Trump. The bill will include $600 payments to most American. The bill which is more than 5K pages long also includes a federal spending budget of over $1.4T and has a net cost of only $350B in relief spending with the rest coming from unspent money from the previous bill.

[Here](https://ibb.co/3dcfyNc) are the most interesting economic reports coming today, with the GDP revision, consumer confidence index and home sales coming early in the morning.

We also get a single big earnings report today, coming from [CarMax](https://ibb.co/k4vtbFp) which will show us how the second-hand car market is doing, this may impact other stocks like Carvana and even car manufacturers. So, will writing this, CarMax released the [earnings](https://ibb.co/Z2r0qBy) and delivered a beat on the top and bottom line but underwhelmed on comparable store sales which were down 0.8% vs the 4.1% increase expected. I will come back tomorrow and discuss more about this after I get into the earnings report more in-depth. 

In some other stock market news, [GM](https://ibb.co/dMJrMQd) has landed 10K pre-orders for the new Hummer EV for the Edition 1 model which will be listed well above the $100K mark and will start production next year, this is another manufacturer that is going to keep putting more and more pressure on Tesla’s EV market share.

Tesla also continued to drop yesterday after [reports](https://ibb.co/sgvtSh3) that Apple is moving forward with a self-driving car by 2024 that would include its own breakthrough battery technology. Apple has started this project in 2014 but this had low interest from the company in the past years, has recently been brought back into focus, as they are targeting a unique mono-cell battery design that could radically reduce the cost and increase the range of the vehicle. Though I believe this is very unlikely to happen, as Apple is more likely to license this kind of technology, or maybe they will try to rely on some kind of a manufacturing partner rather than start manufacturing their own cars

We also saw the whole solar energy stock rallying again after reports that the spending bill will [include](https://ibb.co/N2q4RWp) $35B in energy R&D programs, with an extension of the Tax Credit for solar & wind power.

While another stay-at-home winner, [Peloton](https://ibb.co/dbhH7xQ) just agreed to acquire Precor for $420M as they seek to expand the market share and the manufacturing capabilities to keep up with the big demand which has caused delays.

Another recent stock market favorite also received a one-year $114M option contract from the US army. This helped pushed [Palantir](https://ibb.co/q0dgSkK) almost 10% up in regular trading and more than 2% again in after-hours.

Let’s hope for a good day in the market as the [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/QkQymBh) seem to be pointing at a good open, with the Nasdaq Composite leading the way.

Your neighborhood Copper prophet is back to deliver some good news.

Alright, as [u/VitoCorlene](https://www.reddit.com/u/VitoCorlene/) continues to deliver more of his steel prophecies, I think it's appropriate I give you guys some of the more important and juicier DD (scriptures you'll find usually find in [r/investing](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/)) for you autistic tendies chasing perma bulls. If you refer to my first post, that was just a general/catch-all/scratch the surface type of information **but the bread and butter is in this post:**

**1) FCX has one of the LOWEST PRODUCTION COSTS within the industry**

"As a mechanical engineer for Asarco, I can tell you that literally everyone is sitting jealous of Freeport. Typical production cost per pound for each mine tend to average around 1.70. Asarco's is about 1.53 but my mine is tiny compared to many of the competitors. **Freeport is sitting at like 1.15.** Thats how they're actually able to be paying off debt and hire up a shitton of engineers to improve their processes."

*\[This valuable piece of information was given to me by someone who directly works in the copper industry\]*

&#x200B;

**2) Biden Administration will be balls deep in solar energy**

"Biden pledged to reverse Trump-era environmental rollbacks and re-empower federal bodies such as the Environmental Protection Agency. His appointment of scores of federal officials — in dozens of energy-relevant bodies, from the departments of interior and agriculture to energy..."

Congress approved a new economic stimulus proposal that includes roughly **$35.2 billion for energy initiatives**

$1.5 billion for new solar technologies

$2.6 billion set aside for transportation technologies

$1.7 billion reauthorization of the Weatherization Assistance Program

Energy-grid technologies get a $3.44 billion boost through $1.08 billion in support for short-term, long-term, seasonal and transportation energy storage technologies and $2.36 billion for smart utility and energy distribution technologies. 

$625 million is dedicated to new research, development and commercialization for both onshore and offshore wind technologies

$850 million is being set aside for geothermal technology development

$933 million for marine energy and hydropower tech

$160 million earmarked for hydropower generator upgrades

$500 million pot for stakeholders in industries like iron, steel, aluminum, cement and chemicals as well as transportation businesses like shipping, aviation and long-distance transport that are looking to decarbonize.

$6.2 billion for carbon capture utilization and storage technologies

$6.6 billion in funding for the modernization of existing nuclear power plants and the development of advanced reactors

$4.7 billion for nascent fusion industry

The new energy bill includes a directive to the Department of the Interior to target the generation of 25 gigawatts of solar, wind and geothermal production on public lands by 2025.

&#x200B;

**3) Freeport-McMoRan Has Broken Out of a Large Double Bottom Formation**

https://preview.redd.it/ddyp0efllq661.png?width=773&format=png&auto=webp&s=c755f7485166aaf2ebfc10417c46354f2d456955

🚀 Prices are in a bullish alignment - in an uptrend above the rising 40-week moving average line. The weekly OBV line is bullish and so is the MACD oscillator.

🚀 **Prices have both broken a major long-term downtrend** and **broken out of a double bottom pattern** when the highs of 2018 were broken. The height of this pattern projected upwards gives us at least a **$35 price target.**

Listen nerds, I'm literally handing you a platter of tendies so just fcking take them and treat your wife's boyfriend to a nice post-covid vacation next year or so. I know you're sick and tired of jerking off to your own loss porn while waiting for your next paycheque. **Clearly, I'm on Interstellar's Endurance spaceship with TARS and CASE about to enter a wormhole that'll slingshot me into another galaxy... while most of you nerds are fighting to get on wooden sail boats.**

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**TLDR;** Buy shares, FCX May 21/21 calls (27c/30c range); other great (higher risk, higher upside) plays include Hudbay Minerals and Taseko Mines.

[Because it benefitted him personally](https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/sorrento-sues-soon-shiong-over-catch-and-kill-its-cancer-drug-a-potential-abraxane-rival).

Tl;dr:

* PSS sells company & Abraxane to Celgene for over $1b in Celgene stock
* Abraxane = success = Celgene stock goes up = PSS net worth go uppies
* Cynviloq = Direct competitor to Abraxane = Bad news for PSS net worth
* PSS buys Cynviloq from **SRNE**, and halts all progress - aka “Catch and kill”
* **SRNE** sues for fraud/breach of contract
* PSS tries to get lawsuits dismissed, Judge ain’t having it and ruled it must go to arb
* $1bill lawsuit + damages on table

**DD #2: SRNE and PSS’s fates are still intertwined.**

Yesterday (12/21/2020), NantKwest merged with ImmunityBio, and NK saw its stock price soar by 60% during the day. Why is this significant? **NantKwest’s CEO is PSS from DD#1.**

You may be wondering - well, so what, how does that affect **SRNE?** Great question. [**SRNE** owns 10 million shares of ImmunityBio](https://investors.sorrentotherapeutics.com/node/11421/html) (Ctrl+F “ issued 10 million shares of NantCell”). What the hell is NantCell?

Tl;dr:

* SRNE owns 10mill shares of NantCell
* NantCell changed name to ImmunityBio
* ImmunityBio just merged with NantKwest (stock went up 60% in one day)
* NantKwest CEO is none other than PSS, the guy SRNE is in arbitration with
* Reading between the lines, seems like a successful arbitration arrangement will be announced when you consider the filing on October 27th where [**SRNE** voluntarily dissolved agreement to sell up to $250m worth of shares to raise funds.](https://investors.sorrentotherapeutics.com/static-files/bef9e5a6-1189-4f20-844b-6d19b4f3a463) Why?

Oh, and the next court date for both is a “Post-Arbitration” next year.
* October 21: Court hearing for the $1b arbitration
* October 27th: SRNE voluntarily cuts agreement to sell up to $250m in stock

**DD #3: SRNE rejected $7 a share buyout offer when stock was under $1.6 in November 2019.**

On Monday, November 25th 2019, Sorrento released [this PR](https://investors.sorrentotherapeutics.com/news-releases/news-release-details/sorrento-therapeutics-inc-received-and-rejected-unsolicited-all) stating that they received and rejected a $7/share buyout offer. The trading day prior, the stock price was $1.60. They rejected a buyout of almost 330% premium because they felt **“the offer significantly undervalued Sorrento”** and unanimously rejected it. Keep in mind, this was pre-Covid pipeline, so based on their ownership of their IP / products at the time.

**DD #4: Unusual options activity again!**

Back in March, when SRNE was trading at $1.8, I made a thread on r/options asking about [Unusual Options Activity](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/fl38vh/question_about_unusual_options_activity_does_it/). On March 12th, [someone had purchased ](https://imgur.com/a/rwStwJJ)3700 calls 250% out of the money. SRNE a couple weeks later started its infamous run from $1.8 to $19, and our fellow autists learned about it.

Last week, I noticed unusual options activity again in SRNE. This time, [it was 8500 calls purchased for Jan 15, 2021](https://www.optionsonar.com/unusual-option-activity/srne) representing over $400k in volume for that strike/exp. After a little more digging, I noticed today that there was over $1.4m in Jan 2022 deep ITM calls purchased **just today.**

**DD #5: CEO Compensation Incentives:**

According to the filing below (Ctrl+F "CEO PERFORMANCE AWARD"), Dr. Henry Ji's options begin to vest when the market cap is > $5 billion dollars. His options can be exercised at $17.30. Any shares he acquires must be held for **5 years** after acquiring them before. There is heavy incentive for him to increase shareholder value.

TLDR: If not using Robinhood, buy QS warrant for massive arb opportunity, probably going to close within a month. Hold for a few weeks, make massive bucks even if QS doesn't go up. 🚀🚀🚀

SPACs gets issues as Units, which quickly split between the normal shares, and warrants.
These warrants are typically a 11.5 strike call on the share, and they can only get exercised after the merger with the target company. Minimum 30 days after, in practice a few more extra weeks after that, as the SEC is slow to approve the S1 filing for the merger.

KCAC became QS on November 27th. Which means that QS warrants will become exercisable theoretically as early as December 27th, in reality probably mid-January.

Because Robinhood doesn't allow trading on warrants and probably the lazy "professional" market makers only look at the normal options, this QS warrant is stupidly undervalued.

Even for a "European-style" option that can't be exercised yet, they should still be worth at least intrinsic. Intrinsic value is: share price - strike price.
Here we have QS closing the day at $94.9, strike price $11.5, these should be worth at least $83.4.
They are currently trading for... $27.12.
That's $56.28 too low. We're talking about +207.5% in a matter of weeks.

Alright that's retarded enough. But there's more! When the warrant becomes exercisable in a few weeks, you can just freely take your massively undervalued warrant, message your broker to exercise these, and bam, you end up with the shares, currently worth 3 times as much.
But even if you're worried about operational aspects, worry not my child! One thing the market makers got good at, is on the day these become exercisable, they quickly buy them and erase the arbitrage opportunity. So they will just pump up the warrant back to its correct value and you'll just have to sell it back to them!

So yeah if QS falls back down a bit you'll make less money. With the warrants currently at $27, the share would have to fall back below 27+11.5= $38.5 for you to lose money!

Enough people long QS on this sub. Here I'm telling you that you can triple your money by just not being a massive gay bear in QS. It just needs to roughly not go back down too much and you'll make money. Any gains on the share will eventually get reflected 1:1 on the warrant. Literally can't go tits up!!! 🚀🚀🚀🚀

Previous experience on doing the same on NKLA and HYLN warrants but they weren't even close to that stupid level of being undervalued.

Current positions: long 5k QS warrants. 🚀🚀

Even though law is passed and enforced, it may be difficult for U.S. regulators to crack down on Alibaba. American investors don’t actually own shares of Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce and cloud services giant. Instead, BABA stock represents shares of Alibaba Group Holding Corp. Americans own shares of a variable interest entity (VIE) headquartered in the Cayman Islands, not in China. In other words, U.S. securities laws may be one step removed from Alibaba itself. That separation could make it nearly impossible for U.S. auditors to legally gain access to anything other than the books of the VIE. Perhaps the most likely outcome of the entire scenario is that Alibaba will simply comply with the new regulations. The company has repeatedly said that it stands behind the integrity of its accounting.

Alibaba has previously been investigated by the SEC back in 2016, and there were never any bombshell revelations or allegations stemming from that investigation.

In my opinion, suspicion over Chinese stock accounting is one of the biggest reasons why Alibaba shares are trading at 21.3 times forward earnings. Meanwhile, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is trading at 70 times forward earnings.

On August 25, 2020, Palantir Technologies Inc. (the “Company”) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) a registration statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-248413), which was originally declared effective by the SEC on September 22, 2020 (the “Registration Statement”). The Registration Statement registered the resale of 257,135,415 shares of Class A common stock of the Company by the registered stockholders identified in the prospectus included in the Registration Statement. As disclosed in the Registration Statement, the Company intended to maintain the effectiveness of the Registration Statement for 90 days. Such 90-day period has lapsed, during which the Company has been subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13 or Section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Accordingly, the “current public information” requirements of Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (“Rule 144”), have been satisfied as of the date hereof and, subject to compliance with the other provisions of Rule 144, the registered stockholders may be able to sell their shares pursuant to Rule 144.
In accordance with an undertaking made by the Company in the Registration Statement to remove by means of a post-effective amendment any of the securities registered which remain unsold at the termination of the offering, this Post-Effective Amendment No. 1 to the Registration Statement is being filed to terminate the effectiveness of the Registration Statement and to remove from registration all securities registered but not sold under the Registration Statement._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Me at Market open every Monday _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Let’s see _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ How on earth is this sub ignoring $NET Cloudflare?

Reminder that even the SEC is a paying customer of Cloudflare along with every other website you basically use, and now that they're competing with Amazon and constantly unleashing new vertical integrations and winning, the long-term upside of this company is basically infinite.

I don't pay attention to it and won't respond if you ask something._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Selling Put Leaps on AMC https://preview.redd.it/e6tkyftirn661.png?width=837&format=png&auto=webp&s=4a25f3b0cca12b3529dcb108cfc3232d5bad01c1

As it stands, analysts have AMC at about 52-56% chance of bankruptcy. I am pretty sure it's not going to happen, so I am putting my money where my mouth is.

AMC $2p 1/21/22 x50. I put up $10k collateral and receive $5,851 in credit, so I am really only putting up $4,149 on this bet (max loss). If it holds above $2 by expiration, I'll make 140% in 13 months. Heck, I still profit if it stays above $1.

I don't think AMC is going to do well, but I think they will limp along until summer of 2021 and then start to recover. If AMC goes back to $5 or $6 in the next 3-6 months and the price of the contract drops to like $0.50 or so, I'd probably exit and use the capital elsewhere._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ PVGO and the reason that tsla shorts keep getting fucked Alright retards, time for class. put on your thinking caps. Im here to explain to you what PVGO is and how it affects stock prices. It is also why TSLA shorts have been getting reamed for the past year, why people are willing to pay $47/share for NIO, and why people pay anything for an unprofitable company like PLTR. You all probably know what it is in essence but don't know the name. So welcome to finance 101

**PVGO is an acronym for Present Value of Growth Opportunities**

Basically, it represents the component of a company’s stock value that corresponds to the investors’ expectations of growth in earnings. 

[PVGO picture for those who cant read](https://preview.redd.it/w0c6ocetnn661.png?width=1158&format=png&auto=webp&s=4a6e116420a0ac8853d48b4274b8ef81845da30d)

In retard speak, PVGO represents the difference between what a company is **fundamentally worth** and what investors **think it should be fundamentally worth in the future.** 

&#x200B;

When it comes to companies like TSLA, everyone has seen the wonderful graph comparing TSLA market cap and cars sold compared to other auto makers. In fact, many think that TSLA is a bubble waiting to pop. The reason they're wrong is PVGO. 

* As long as investors believe in the future of tesla and think they will remain innovative and ambitious, the stock price will not crash hard like people are expecting. 

You can see PVGO in most stocks, from GameStop to Nio to PLTR. The one thing they have in common is that investors *expect* that they will grow, so they *pay for the value of that growth.*_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ ArcelorMittal, Nippon Steel to build new electric arc furnace in U.S. $MT and Nippon Steel the #1 & #3 steel makers in the world building a $775MM Electric Arc Furnace (EAF) in Alabama. 

https://www.worldsteel.org/steel-by-topic/statistics/top-producers.html

https://www.google.com/amp/s/finance.yahoo.com/amphtml/news/arcelormittal-nippon-steel-build-electric-005432001.html

Why is this important?

The advantage of arc furnaces is that they use scrap metal rather than iron ore as the main fuel. They use a lot less energy than blast furnaces and can be quickly stopped and restarted. Also, steel plants can time their operations to take advantage of low cost electricity.

The future of steel making is EAF manufacturing and it is what many Manufacturers have been building and switching over to vs blast furnaces that need iron ore and coaking coal. 

EAF’s:

Use obsolescent scrap as the main source of material.

Use electricity as its main source of energy to melt scrap and adjust the properties in a ladle furnace.

Lower initial costs and takes up less space.

Take less time to manufacture products.

EAF-based steelmaking production in the U.S. accounted for 70 percent of the total steel produced in 2019, and the scramble to identify appropriate feedstock has been an issue in the country for the better part of a decade. The world is well-behind the U.S., but if the Europeans switch one-third of their production capacity en masse throughout the next eight to 10 years, that need is going to turn critical for them almost overnight. Direct-reduced iron (DRI) hasn’t been in shortage globally since 2008, but it is more challenging to source than regular iron ore, and smart producers are taking steps to secure supply well before that potential crisis develops.

$MT 🚀_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Ya win some, ya lose some. Oh well, guess I’ll just load the truck some more. 🤷🏻‍♂️ _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ GME: Why it's time for shorts to give up. Alright retards, listen up. Im back with some more bullish DD on our very favourite gamestop incorporation. To preface, I am not a financial advisor so fuck off SEC and mods. If you're new here, the old DD is there for you to read, I wont repost it. The best way to hold this is **BUYING AND HOLDING SHARES**.

As we know, the gamestop bankrupt hypothesis is completely obliterated at this point and for the mid to long term future. the NeXt BlOcKbStEr bullshit is out the window. done. I'm also not going to talk about any type of short squeeze, we already know about that and you can read about that elsewhere. 

**Heres a list of things that we know:**

* Cohen *just* increased his stake in gamestop to almost 13%.
* Gamestop is closing unprofitable locations
* Gamestop is *omnichanneling* their retard energy into online 
* Melvin capital has a MASSIVE short position and they are sweating
* BofA also has a large short position
* Sherman is clueless
* Gamestop will likely surprise wall street with their holiday sales and eps 

But why is this important? Who gives a fuck? dont we already know this shit?

Many saw cohen as a potential catalyst but it was a gamble. Since he entered his position at such a low share price, he could easily leave it and take a profit. And after suffering through that earnings call the two options for cohen were: GTFO or hostile takeover. 

* Since cohen ***Increased*** his holding after that debacle, it is easy to see that he will not be leaving us high and dry. **It is now impossible for sherman to dilute his position to under 11%. He is preparing for war.** We can speculate all day into what this means, but one thing is certain. If GameStop doesn't shape up, Cohen will do ***Something.*** This is bullish

This one's a no brainer, but sometimes can scare people off. Headlines that GameStop is closing more stores may seem bearish, but heres why it's not: 

* It's no secret that brick and mortar is falling off, and if GameStop were to fight tooth and nail to remain a largely brick and mortar retailer they would go bankrupt in no time. It is also a fact that underperforming stores drain cash, which lowers net income and thus lowers earnings per share. Any store that is ***LOSING MONEY*** or is barely breaking even is keeping the stock price down because it's preventing future growth and killing net incomes. **Closing underperforming stores will lead to a higher EPS and more cash that can be allocated to growth.**

Gamestop is rebranding, and shifting to becoming the **one stop video game and video game related product online retailer.** While we haven't seen exactly what this will be, it is bullish to see them pivoting into other products besides just video games. Headsets, TVS, PC parts, you name it. You've seen the omnichannel memes, but we know that **If they are bullshitting, Cohen will step in.** Expect to see real progress made.

&#x200B;

Melvin and BoA both have short positions, and are desperately trying to drive the price down. Unfortunately, it is getting harder and harder to convince people that gamestop is a failing business. They are sweating and will continue to sweat. Given the buy side volume, they could close these short positions gradually without triggering a massive squeeze, however it **WILL drive the price up significantly higher than it is now.** 

&#x200B;

Sherman is a clueless boomer who is gonna have his ass handed to him by the younger, smarter, better Ryan Cohen. I mean look at this guy. He's gonna get his ass handed to him and have no clue what's happening. Cohen has a gun to his head and he's sweating. 

[Just look at his face. You can see the fear in his eyes. The fake smile. He is terrified.](https://preview.redd.it/wqrztm3vjn661.png?width=294&format=png&auto=webp&s=d1eaace117ae61da56ef5d741be36d1e05d71246)

Finally, It is likely that GME will more than likely beat earnings next quarter. I won't go into much detail into this because it is not my expertise, however u/Uberkikz11 has done some amazing DD and has been doing so for a long time. This guy literally goes into GameStop stores to get his information. Read this: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kh9na8/gme\_4q20\_financial\_model/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kh9na8/gme_4q20_financial_model/)

&#x200B;

Basically, GameStop is a very solid bet. Barring the event of a total market crash and new bullish news, I think it is extremely realistic to hit 17-20 by EOY. Obviously this is a shares play, but for you gamblers, I cant see jan 15 16-20 calls not printing bigly. Long term calls or leaps too. If you're new to gamestop, the volatility will seem scary but the shorts fight hard with this one. -10% days followed by +20% days are not unusual. Fortunately these swings dont burn much theta as they are relatively common and expected.

Some points about the industry:

* The next generation of primary storage arrays continues to be shaped by NVMe, AIOps, public cloud integration and alternative consumption models. I&O leaders must view future primary storage array investments as foundational to digital business transformation.
* By 2025, at least 50% of enterprises will shift toward operating expenditure (opex)-based storage consumption models, compared to less than 10% today.
* By 2023, at least 20% of enterprises will leverage cloud storage management tools to integrate on-premises storage platforms directly with the public cloud for backup and disaster recovery use cases.
* By 2025, at least 20% of enterprises will adopt NVMe-oF, compared to less than 5% today.
* Our Govt. and Agencies around the world are under constant cyber attacks.  The security of information is invaluable and the demand for reliable data storage and securities will grow exponentially, as will the cost. 
* In the last year, Pure has continued to innovate and deliver new solutions that solve pressing customer needs.

Pure storage, simply is **high-performance data storage**.  They started in 2009 developing software for [storage controllers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disk_array_controller) using generic [flash storage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_memory) hardware while secretly developing their proprietary software.  They completed this in 2015 and went public, raising $470m in venture capital efforts.  Now they are a leader in Garnet Magic Quadrant for primary storage arrays in 2020.

Some cool examples of their reputation: F1's top team, Mercedes AMG picked them up and has attributed their success to PSTG's tech.  The City of New Orleans was victim to an extensive cyber attack in 2019 and PSTG saved the day.  PSTG's tech was recently compared to Dell's EMC Powerstore and it wasn't even close.  Pure Storage's FlashArray is the shit.  When the top entities look for data security and management they're not going to settle for the 2nd or 3rd best option, they're going to the best in the industry.

The run-up for PSTG and many stocks post-election has been the stuff of fairy tales, but I'm not letting that slight me.  Sometimes I will turn away from stocks because I think it's too late, but in reality I'm early.  I bought CRSR at 25 and sold at 35 (F).  Honestly there's no telling how high a company can really run up.  All I know is with a market cap of 6 billion, PSTG has a long way to go.  The 20% run-up over the last month has been on average daily volume.  It looks like institutions have been steadily accumulating ever since Pure Storage established themselves as the best in the industry with the highest potential for growth.  Their numbers make me think that they will be bought out by a larger entity soon, because they're basically operating at a net loss, but with huge potential if they can get their costs down.  **1.36b revenue in 2019.**

Keith Martin, the Senior Director at Cloud Capacity Engineering had this to say about PSTG:

*“Pure has had a revolutionary impact on the business, completely changing our mindset and how the cloud infrastructure team functions. The storage experience freed us up to be more creative. It was a magical transformation.”*

Lastly I really like the team.  The CEO was a Senior Exec at Cisco Systems.  The CTO was a founding engineer at Veritas, and their Co-Founder served in Yahoo!'s Office of the Chief Technologist.  The company is solid, has a ton of new press / clout and is clearly going places considering cybersecurity is  probably the hottest sector right now.  I am blown away that the volume has been so low so far especially with Cathy scooping up shares all year.  I really love how the chart looks with slow and steady bleed up over the last month.  I expect a huge pop this week.

Solar stocks rallied again today amid bipartisan support for a tax credit extension in the massive spending bill awaiting passage by the U.S. Congress.
According to reports, the deal will include $35B in energy R&D programs, a two-year extension of the Investment Tax Credit for solar power, a one-year extension of the Production Tax Credit for wind power projects, and a five-year extension for offshore wind tax credits.
A two-year solar tax credit extension is "a much better outcome than the industry had expected," says Wood Mackenzie head of solar research Ravi Manghani, adding it will provide significant upside to solar growth through 2025 as more projects can secure the 26% and 22% credits through "commence-construction" or "safe-harboring" provisions by 2023.
A two-year extension is "positive for all" solar firms, with higher demand especially so for residential developers

## Disappointing quarterly results

*Given the surge in demand for* [*cloud computing*](https://www.fool.com/knowledge-center/what-is-cloud-computing.aspx) *and subscription offerings over the last several years, Splunk has been transitioning from its legacy on-premises data analytics and monitoring software business to a subscription-based cloud portfolio.*

*That shift negatively affects revenue recognition under generally accepted accounting principles (*[*GAAP*](https://www.fool.com/knowledge-center/your-guide-to-gaap.aspx)*), though. The company's new subscription business model corresponds to lower revenue recognition because of smaller annual ratable payments compared to previous multi-year term licenses with large upfront payments.* 

*Investors should expect that accounting trick to depress Splunk's top-line performance until that transition to a subscription-based business is over, by 2023. But even with that context, the company's fiscal third-quarter revenue decline of 11% year over year to $558.6 million, way below management's guidance of $600 million to $630 million, remains disappointing.*

Let's dive into it with China. China is currently enduring the [Long Winter](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/21/world/asia/china-electricity-coal-shortage.html?referringSource=articleShare). Cities are without heat and lighting. Coal shortages are rising as China continues to embargo coal from Australia. Coal production is down in China due to a mine accident.

Let's take a look at Coal Futures:

[Coal Futures](https://preview.redd.it/pqeqisyyrm661.png?width=752&format=png&auto=webp&s=9e8d2c0b4b61fefb9eaaeb6494650ba315c98c47)

China produces a [major amount of electricity](https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3114222/china-reassures-public-balanced-coal-supply-winter-provinces?utm_source=Twitter&utm_medium=share_widget&utm_campaign=3114222) from coal. This can't be changed overnight, and we see China paying huge premiums for coal from non-Australian sources. Australia companies have 8.8m tons of coal sitting in ships ready to be offloaded in Chinese ports, and will begin withdrawing their ships at huge losses to relieve crews and try to find alternative destinations.

Who stands to benefit from this - Canada and the USA. Canada and the USA have major coal producers who have excess supply needing to find a home. $TECK has already sold lots of coal to China at huge premiums over prices at home, and was [enduring a strike](https://www.mining.com/strike-ends-at-canadas-westshore-coal-terminal-after-union-announces-agreement/) in British Columbia (their port to China). The strike just ended, and we should see increase shipping in the near future.

Bulk Shipping Index: [Link](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BDIY:IND) \- here's an index for current shipping rates. Increases in the index imply higher shipping rates.

Two plays:

1. Bulk Shipping - look at bulk shippers with US/Canada exposure to take advantage of huge demand from China to fuel their winter for coal. Bulk shippers have taken a beating through Covid. Look into Star Bulkers and Eagle Bulkers - FWIW, Star is a major shipper for VALE and you iron miners.
2. Coal Miners - TECK is a play I've already introduced, but Peabody Energy and Arch Resources are two other US plays that can stand to benefit. Continue to keep an eye on coal futures.

My positions:

1. I have a few hundred shares of Arch Resources and you can see my $TECK positions from the second entry into Commodity Club._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Autist trade idea: Write puts on QS 100P 1/15 for $40 or 13000% CAGR _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Robinhood cuts margin interest rate to 2.5% _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Just another day in the market _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ SFIX - Short Squeeze Ending and a long way to fall This play is very risky so pls don't put your life savings into this one. SFIX recently beat expectations for their Q1 earnings, with 10% revenue growth and a profit of $0.09 per share. This caused analysts to update their price target to $45, but also triggered a massive short squeeze since short interest was \~40% prior to the earnings report.

However, if you track the daily trading volume since the earnings report ever since December 7th, today has been the lowest volume day in a long while. This could be a good signal that most of the big shorts that were underwater have now covered and that the fuel for the massive run from $35 -> $70 the past week is starting to run out of fuel. Put premiums for this week are still cheap as fuck but also keep in mind this is a shorter trading week so trade at your own risk. I already YOLO'd a shit ton of $60 and $65 puts, although I should have gotten in later since my cost basis could be better. I see major resistance at $71, where it has been rejected several times, and also believe that people should be taking profits soon after seeing the volume die down. Hopefully SFIX shareholders aren't bag holders like all of us and take the 100% profits soon.

In addition, insiders and the CEO have been unloading shares from **$63 - $68** so if they don't believe their own company is worth the current price then other shareholders and maybe even retail might start to realize too. CEO dumped about 20,000 shares =  \~**$1.2M** worth the last 2 days (12/16 and 12/17), President officer dumped **$600K**, COO dumped 40,000 shares = \~**$2.4M**. All of these SEC filings were released tonight, so longs will be able to react to the news tomorrow, also not sure if anyone wants to buy at the these prices anymore since the company ran up 100% in only 1 week. See SEC documents for exact numbers:

**Positions:** 100 $60 12/24 PUTS and 20 $65 12/24 PUTS. Yeah I know I'm a dumbass for playing weeklies but that's why this is tagged with YOLO.

**TLDR:** short squeeze giant stairs up, elevator down. Insiders + CEO + COO dumping millions worth of SFIX shares. YOLO PUT play if people realize covering volume dying and profit taking starts.

Not sure how deep their pockets are_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Our calls appreciate it very much Tim Apple _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Is there a way or a website to find out when new options are being added or when they'll be available? This 15c for January can't be purchased but I noticed it last night. _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Do NOT buy Quantumscape (QS) unless you just want to gamble with -EV Ok so this post mirrors my post from almost 6 months ago when I posted about Hertz the day it reached its top of 6+ dollars after already announcing bankruptcy (it went from like 50 cents to 6+ dollars). You can see my submitted post history for that. Since this is an r/wallstreetbets post, I'll talk about something that rarely anyone ever talks about but impacts options pricing - the borrow rate - so that it's an informative post too even if you aren't interested in QS. 

For the record I'm posting this as QS is 105 AH 12/21 so I can look back in 3-6 months. First, I'm not short QS so I don't want to hear some comment below saying you are just desperate because you are taking a huge loss. I'm posting this as a warning/advice just like when I posted about Hertz because at this point it's actually extremely negative expected value (EV) to go long QS through call options/shares. 

First the IV is ridiculously high. There could be many situations that play out in which you can buy calls, it goes up 10%, and you will end up down. Second, one of the reasons for why anyone would buy QS is to collect the borrow rate, which is insane. However, most brokers don't give the customer this borrow or if they do, don't give the full borrow. For RH, you get none of this borrow, so this alone makes this very -EV at these price points. Finally, the most obvious reason, it's quite clear this stock is overvalued as it won't even have any revenue or sales for a few years. It's similar to NKLA actually (look at that chart when it briefly hit 90 earlier this year). 

The stock is undergoing a short squeeze with high borrow rates, which is causing this spike, but historically these stop pretty fast and when it pulls back, all those calls/shares will lose value. There's like plenty of examples of this just this year, and the goal is obviously not to buy at the top. The main issue is also when it pulls back, it doesn't usually EVER bounce back up. See the NKLA bagholders at 90, HTZ bagholders at 6, KODK bagholders at 55, etc. 

In the case you just wanted to just gamble, it's actually not a bad stock to purely gamble. However, there are plenty of better gambles out there that should return a higher expected return. Second, gambling is fine but we all know what happens when you play roulette in the long run. Sure you can hit that 23 number you bet on, but the more you push it, the quicker all of that goes away. So that's why this is a fair warning. You can gamble and you might win even for a short time period, but most will be left holding the bag. And when they hold the bag, they hold it all the way down. 

I also wouldn't outright short this right now unless you want to sell a long dated call spread/naked OTM long-dated call. As I mentioned, the IV and borrow are extremely high, so a short term long puts strategy will have an extremely tough time printing. Furthermore, it's somewhat hard to short the stock with this high borrow, and that borrow is embedded in puts too. However, longer term, it's clearly a short at these levels, but you have to do it in some more unique ways as I mentioned above. 

Finally, if QS spikes up from this 105 AH number, I guarantee you there will be some idiots who are gonna be posting here in the comments section about how they were right/I was wrong (see the HTZ comments). I'm ok with that. That means I didn't call the top exactly perfectly, but as I said, you can revisit this post in 3-6 months. Ironically on HTZ, the day after I posted, it did actually go up that day (to 6+), got a lot of shit comments, and I'm sure 100% of those guys lost money since it has never even seen anywhere close to that price ever again as the next day was the top. So same situation here. Just a fair warning.

Boomer in the comments:

If Musk changed his mind and said LiDAR is the future then every single person that rails against LiDAR would change their tune too. The argument is not about science. It’s tribalism. Waymo uses LiDAR but it also uses cameras, radar, and microphones. And Cornell isn’t even claiming cameras are better – just that the are almost as good in most conditions. The “addition” of LiDAR is undoubtedly better. The question then is cost. Waymo is getting into the LiDAR selling business and has brought the cost down from $75k to $7,500. As the cost comes down and the device becomes more streamlined it might see widespread adoption. I don’t know the future. And neither does Musk. But right now, the technology is at least marginally better than his best effort and when we are talking about a kid running into the street to grab a ball I’d rather vehicles have the marginally better technology. Regulators may agree. And again, costs are coming down so his arguments about the cost are becoming less valid and less relevant. And yes, Telsa has a major advantage in real world conditions. But only with cameras and they have no data on LiDAR so they are not light-years ahead of the competition. Not Waymo. And the fact that some people on here think that Tesla’s autopilot is more than just branding and that other high end apaptive cruise control isn’t the same… is scary. Don’t treat it like autopilot! I like Tesla. I like electric cars. But I don’t like how science is turning into politics. Let LiDAR technology develop and if it works great. No one should be hoping it fails.

Other than maybe people that have a financial interest in Tesla and don’t value human life. Also, I don’t like that Tesla isn’t working harder to try to open its charging network to non-Tesla. Even charging a premium would be fine but don’t intentionally stifle EV adoption. Tesla has done the impossible and that’s great but it doesn’t mean Musk doesn’t make mistakes. Look no further than his plan to automate his factories. It failed. But to his credit, he changed positions and admitted his mistake. If LiDAR comes down to sub-$2,000 I’d be surprised if he doesn’t adopt it. And while I’m on an epic rant, Tesla’s valuation makes no sense to me. I have always thought Tesla would be very successful so it is not that I’m betting against them. It’s just that if 10 years from now we have self-driving cars it won’t make sense to own cars at the same level as today. There will be a decline. And even if Tesla is a leader in autonomous vehicles it doesn’t seem possible that others won’t be competing in that space considering how evey car manufacturer has invested in adaptive crusie control tech dev (unlike EV… which they lagged significantly). And it’s hard to imagine people will only use Tesla self-driving. Premium will have its place (limos) but people will tend to go with the cheapest functional self driving service – that I’m sure about. So the next 5-10 years should be great but at best… after that is unknown. At worst, expect car ownership to drop and self driving taxi companies to be a dime a dozen. Too hard to predict which means the value is too high. **The camera detecting autonomous driving systems are like investing in Garmin in the early 2000s because you think navigation systems are the future but ignoring that rise of smartphones with maps. (Smart phones is Lidar for the autists out there that don't get it)**

The above is something i copypasta'd from a boomer.

There's this technology that companies have been working on for years called Lidar.  There's a few companies that have the price around $10k per system but "that's still too expensive to implement". When firms like GM / Toyota / Volkswagen start funding these companies the tech gets here faster.

AAPL just said they'll get the best self driving and the best batteries. Kinda seems like they'll contract with QS and VLDR.

VLDR market cap still around $500M. If it gets to the size NIO is, that's a 100 fold return in SHARES. imagine calls bois. TENDIE TOWN

After reading DD by u/Rake-7613 yesterday, [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kh7x4x/sgmo\_investment\_thesis\_full\_dd/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kh7x4x/sgmo_investment_thesis_full_dd/), I decided to look at the chart.

I know some of you don't believe in magic charts, crayons, colors, etc. so fuck off. But for those who do... enjoy.

Unfortunately for buyers, the iCar is non-rechargeable after Apple removed the jack, in a courageous effort to innovate EV design.  Proponents of the change say this was bound to happen anyway, and is in no way related to Apples new disposable battery factory.

PTON has [bought Precor for $420 million](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/21/peloton-to-acquire-fitness-equipment-maker-precor-for-420-million.html). For those of you who don't know fitness equipment well, Precor is a good mix of home fitness and average gym supplier (24 hour fitness, LA fitness, etc) and are more affordable than Peloton but less  t r e n d y  


Peloton, being the fuckin baller that they are, decided to buy Precor just because they need help building out their backordered bikes for the holidays. This move is genius for a few reasons

&#x200B;

* Up until now, Peloton has been a classy at home fitness brand with a subscription based app and fitness classes. After everyone gets a bike... then what? This has made their crazy P/E ratio seem undeserved
* With the addition of precor, overnight they've become an at home fitness and commercial gym provider with nationwide connections. They are no longer a boutique upper class fitness provider, but instead appeal to the more affordable fitness bunch as well
* Affirm, the company that lets the plebs pay fixed monthly payments for their Peloton bike, will also probably be used for this much wider range of fitness equipment allowing more people to buy things they can't currently afford (when they IPO, buy a fuckton of shares)  


One warning! This new spike in price will most likely lead to PTON offering shares to raise some cash, but when they do... *btfd*

TLDR: Buy PTON calls at open, sell for a nice profit, wait for share offering, buy the fucking dip
