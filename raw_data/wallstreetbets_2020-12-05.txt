 Citron the Bounty Hunty _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Made my first 10k. Who needs spaceships when we can make real life X-Men with CRISPR. _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Political analysis for why EVs are not done exploding I work in the EV advocacy and clean air arena. Let me tell you why EVs are not done yet and are only going to üöÄüöÄ in 2021 and the following years.  I am approaching this analysis from a political and policy standpoint - so my analysis of individual EV companies will be limited but is meant to provide a bullish outlook for why regulations will be placed on fuel economy standards and what that means for the future of the auto industry.   


**BACKGROUND**  
The transportation sector is responsible for majority of climate change driven emissions in the United States. Within the transportation sector, majority of the emissions comes from light-duty vehicles (LDV) which dominate the overall fleet numbers. However, although the medium and heavy duty vehicle (MHDV) fleets comprise a tiny percentage of the overall US fleet, they disproportionately contribute over 50% of NOx emissions.   


Because of this, there is increased pressure to accelerate EV adoption both in the LDV and MHDV sectors. How will this be done?

* Incentives (rebates, tax credits, installation)
* Regulations (fuel economy, ZEV mandates)

Unfortunately, none of the incentives or regulations have gained much traction under Trump, who has been anti-climate and pro oil and gas, Under Trump, the EPA attacked California and revoked their state authority to set higher greenhouse gas emissions standards than federal ones. Under the Clean Air Act, Section 177, states are given the authority to do this but the EPA must grant them a waiver to do so. There is ongoing litigation on this issue. GM, Toyota, and Fiat-Chrysler [sided](https://apnews.com/article/bb5788e2e8d84a488599c62f8006ca97) with Trump on this issue. GM recently left the lawsuit when Biden won. 

Trump also rolled back the strongest climate policy on the books, which was Obama's Fuel Economy standards. The Obama standards end goal was 54.5 MPG Fuel efficiency and would have limited climate-disrupting pollution by 6 billion tons, save consumers $1.7 trillion dollars in fuel costs, and reduce oil consumption by up to 4 million barrels a day.¬† As part of the rollback - Trump instituted his own fuel economy rules called the SAFE rule - which has been deemed inadequate by both environmental and auto groups. 

**WHAT IS BIDEN GOING TO DO?** 

Joe Biden has the most ambitious climate agenda in modern history. His proposal costs 90x more than what Obama had proposed. With the US falling behind in emissions reduction - the administration knows they need to act fast, aggressive, and be bold. 

Upon entering office on Jan 20, Joe Biden in his first 100 days will make sweeping executive changes and orders that will affect the auto industry and boost EV adoption. 

* He will rollback the Trump rollbacks of California's authority and the Obama Clean Car standards.
* The EPA will grant California their authority back to enforce their LDV standards (14 other states have already adopted the California LDV standards). 
* The EPA will also grant California their authority to enforce their new [Advanced Clean Trucks (ACT)](https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/resources/fact-sheets/advanced-clean-trucks-fact-sheet) rule, which they just proposed and adopted this past summer, which will require manufacturers to increase their electric MHDV sales to be 30-50 percent by 2030. Other states are going to adopt this California truck standard. 
* **He will institute a National EV Mandate.** The details of this are unclear so far as to how he will do this - but it will be subtle. There won't be a regulation or requirement for 100% EV sales or total fleet turnover by a certain year (I could be wrong but it would be harder to push through). What I think they will do is they will build upon the Obama Fuel Economy standards of 54.5 MPG, and propose and adopt a rule for an MPG standard that is strong enough that **ONLY EVS will meet those requirements** and the cost to produce gas vehicles at such high standards will incentivize EV adoption and deter automakers from producing gas vehicles. Effectively an EV mandate, but not in name. 
* He will invest 500,000 charging stations across the country

**WHAT ARE POTENTIAL ROADBLOCKS?** 

* Some Automakers: The EV market is still very nascent and EVs represent a very very small portion of overall vehicle sales. Some automakers are still incentivized to sell gas vehicles since that's what the majority of consumers want. Other automakers recognize that if they don't switch to EVs soon - Daddy Elon Musk is going to own the world 
* Consumers: Lack of charging stations, battery range, low supply of EVs, and general misinformation against EVs are currently deterring consumers from making the switch
* Labor: There are over 1.7 million jobs in the auto industry, majority of which work for the Big 3 American automakers who are slow on transitioning towards EVs. EVs are easier to manufacture and produce and require less workers. They also require less service and repair. The autoworkers union is heavily invested in making sure jobs are not lost in this transition towards EVs
* Dealers: The dealer model is under direct attack from EV manufacturers who directly sell to consumers. Additionally, majority of the revenue for dealers does NOT come from selling vehicles, but it comes from service and maintenance of cars. EVs save consumers  thousands of dollars less annually on service and maintenance

**CONCLUSION**

* EVs are the future. The Biden EV plan will spur EV adoption and transform the industry. Both the  LDV and MHDV sectors will be under pressure due to regulation and climate goals to go electric.

No meme stocks or ev plays. 20k to almost 700k. Return to the mean bet. _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ SPY LEAPS _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Hi. Fastest Growing Companies in 2020 _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ THE BIRTH OF A REAL TESLA BEAR _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Bill Ackman was asked, "What's the single best business in the world?" Been lurking here for awhile.  Thought I'd share a small story with everyone.  If you don't like reading, carry on your way, ya fckin degen.

I began MY journey to degeneracy with a simple "intro to understanding a business" video I found on youtube.  The business model explored in this video was a simple lemonade stand.  Basic, straightforward fundamentals; perfect.  A striking, clearly intelligent, well spoken, demure, silver-haired gentleman guides me through the growth of this business model, beginning as single lemonade stand with a single investor, all the way through to a dividend paying, publicly traded company.  Had doubts at first but it ends up being pretty good stuff.  I noted the gentleman's name and carried on my way, to continue skimming the very surface of the business/finance world.

   As you may have guessed, the gentleman in this video is Bill Ackman.  I took a liking to the guy.  I did some reading, watched some more videos.  Wasn't long before I found out about Pershing Square Tontine Holdings.  Didn't know what a SPAC was so I had to learn about those.  Turns out Spacman's SPAC isn't like other SPACs.  Okay cool, why?  Many reasons, the largest (as I understand them) being, the massive amount of capital at its disposal, and the "tontine" setup of share value/distribution, upon merger.  

Okay so how'd I get here?  I found a post by u/infamousbreadfruit99 (if you see this, thank you btw, great stuff).  His post about going hard into SPACman's SPAC reminded of an interview I'd seen with him.  This video was about Ackman's missed opportunity with VISA/MASTERCARD going public.  The video starts with Ackman recounting sometime someone asked him the question in the title, "What is the single best business in the world?"  His answer?  "If you could own a royalty on people spending money."  Smart guy, smart answer.

...and AFAIK Stripe is... literally that... right?

Anyway.  Felt like sharing.

Now after some bte earning reports its floating around 388. If you look at the chart it seems at least in the last trading day it keeps trying to trend to 390 bit keeps pushing back. It is likely at a peek.

Thing is a very small number of SNOW stocks are available to the public many being held by employees and insiders. At IPO almost 90 percent is private.

On Dec 14th the lockup period ends and the insiders will be allowed to dump up to 25 percent of their stocks.


Its gonna tank hard. The valuation is insane, the employees are gonna sell off. If you are holding SNOW sell now because there is gonna be a mass sell off leading up to the 14th.

Meme stocks = üöÄüöÄüåùüåù _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Just waiting for a good Monday _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ You trolls are in desperate need of understanding Vega Please read this, [https://martinkronicle.com/option-trading-vega/](https://martinkronicle.com/option-trading-vega/)

Try to learn Vega and understand options trading better.

You can realize high profits by finding low IV stocks that increase in volatility during the course of a LEAPS contract.

Don't hold til expiry, don't trade weekly's. Hold on to a contract until it produces a profit, then sell to close. Consistent profits because you'll be correct more often than you're not correct, if you manage your bankroll and learn trading this way.

Example: research a stock you are bullish on, you believe the market has oversold it in the past year (for me, this is Intel).

If any kind of bullish news releases in the next year that causes IV to increase, the underlying doesn't even have to move much, but IV (which is this theoretical value that is constantly fluctuating over time) moves in your favor, then you profit at that point by selling the contract to the bulls who are rallying the stock and driving the premiums up.

It's almost guaranteed money (edit: I'm exaggerating of course, for those who took this literally, there is always risk involved and a lot of factors will determine the success of ANY strategy applied)

If you're wrong and picked a stock that actually is decreasing in value over the course of the LEAP (a contract with greater than 1 year to expiry), then so fucking what? At any point you can sell for a loss (but still recoup a lot of your original premium).

And you have more than one contract, so eventually you're going to be in the green on most of them.

If you can't profit from this then you're really bad at picking stocks and should stop or pay someone to help you.

&#x200B;

>If you pay $0.09 per contract and buy 100 contracts, that costs you $900 up front  
>  
>Stock moves up $4 within the year at some point... IV has spiked... premium is selling at $0.27 per contract, that is 300% increase in premium value, you sell your contract and take $2700.... so you turned $900 into $2700 within 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, or some time frame between now and the expiry of the LEAPS contract.  
>  
>You're just waiting to be correct, if the stock pick eventually goes up at any point you have the potential to sell for profit at higher premium than you paid.

&#x200B;

TLDR look at every good stock, look at IV, find low IV (this usually means premiums will cost less), find indicator of being oversold, look at the greeks, look for high vega, high delta, low theta, contracts with at least 1 year to expiry, buy as close to ITM as you can, but OTM are cheaper and can reduce risk but also profit greatly from these types of IV spikes and spikes in premium as a result, I prefer OTM because cheaper.

**Some new IPO's/SPAC's, or** just **companies** that have been **under the radar** and already passed over for what appeared to be better long term investments, **are going for modern or interesting sounding names and tickers**, that may intended **to boost interest in younger investors.**

**LISTEN HERE:**

**THIS IS SO OBVIOUS THAT YOU'RE GOING TO SAY, NO SHIT SHERLOCK, EVERYONE KNOWS THAT.**

**SO DO IT THIS TIME, IF YOU HAVEN'T ALREADY! BUY BEFORE THE MEME GETS SOMEONE RICH THAT'S NOT YOU!**

The **new tickers that move** are ones that **have things that make them sound cool,** and **that's** really **all that matters.** Usually the **name is catchy,** the **ticker is** often **easy to remember and** might even look like it should go that Porsche **you're going to** buy when it's **finally** your turn to **get** rich and post gain **porn.**

**LOOK: These tickers don't require as much fundamental quantification**, compared to some REIT named $LAME buying up closed down dollar general store locations, or something equally boring to talk about. It's all about marketing and perception.

**THE GAMBLE:** What **I suggest** is going **long** on **shares** when you see these particular types of stocks hit the market, especially if you're hearing people asking about them a lot, because if people are interested in crap only because the ticker, product, or company name sounds cool, you may have a winner.

**Typically,** **you want to see if there's a little dip first. If you're already in, this is not the time to sell and try to time re-entry.**  **Some IPO's don't allow shorting for a certain duration,** but that doesn't mean price cannot drop initially. Also, **not all IPO's will run options until a certain number of days have passed,** and there may be some wait before hype is prepared to move the stock, **so watch the option volume very closely and see if it begins to look liquid.** Take this time to consider if the stock will have some sort level of excitement in it, and attract attention. It should sound cool. Honestly, **it should be something that you might not buy yourself, but** you'd definitely **want to try it out or learn more about what the heck this** ticker **thing is** trying to sell if you weren't so lazy and it was free.

We have seen things with **names like LAZR** recently, **pumped by Cramer**, with ooooooo, maybe a military contract, and ahhhh, cool cameras that can probably spot people really far away.

**RKT**, because it even if it has reasonable fundamentals, you know it had to go up for a bit, **because it's named rocket...**

**NIO, PLUG, LI, FCEL, FLIR, PLTR** (I haven't even read the Lord of the Rings series and I know the reference), **TSLA, NKLA, ZooM**, and so forth. **Many** of these companies **doubled, trippled, or** went up even **more,** in very short periods.

Now, **some of those companies** have some value, and some do not, or certainly **not worth** what **their local maxima** will become, so you want to **get in cheap and early as hype begins,** but ***before any major price move***, **and then just wait for the gains and GTFO of the stock unless it's run by some incredibly weird entrapreneur that gets regular interviews on any damn show he wants.** So much of the market is over bought, that people will buy any piece of crap that sounds cool. That's it. That's all you need to know.

**First, I suggest getting the WeBull app**. A lot of people have it, whether that's their broker or not, because it does a few things right, but **mainly it's a convenient way to find out what IPO's may be coming up**. **RKT, PLTR, and many others were announced well in advance via WeBull,** and **if you have notifications on** for it\*\*, you'll get the "memo"\*\* that some of retail is getting. Now **don't go buying every IPO.** You want to **look for a** **product that sounds like it has future potential**, something **not fully tapped into yet,** and the **company name must grab your attention**. You want **a name that sounds exciting and fast paced** to retail. Something that **if you said it at the dinner table,** or around friends, **would the name make people seem honestly interested?**

I have been sitting through this bull run, selling positions early, not going in on the companies I mentioned, using rational reasoning for why to buy a stock. This is not the time for being completely rational. Your investment accounts should be Boglerific, but **your play money needs to find a home in these types of stocks**, **take the large gain when it comes, and dump** the stock **before everyone else** does.

Buy long duration vertical calls if they're available, but **don't plan to hold longer than whenever the spike comes.** **Vertical spreads help reduce IV cost somewhat** (usually) as the two strikes will partially cancel out each others vega, so this lets you get in with a defined risk amount. Shares are still the safer way, as puts will likely be not liquid enough at first to sell bull put verticals, and IPO's like this are more likely to tripple in the first 6 months than they are to become 1/3rd.

**THIS IS NOT ALWAYS THE CASE, AND SHOULD BE CONSIDERED A STRATEGY MOSTLY FOR AN OVERBOUGHT MARKET WITH LITTLE ELSE TO PICK FROM.**

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning December 7th, 2020.

# **Any progress on stimulus could give the market a boost in the week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/04/stimulus-hope-markets-focus-next-week.html)**
*****
> Stimulus to help the economy and vaccines to stop the virus are expected to the be the main focus in markets in the week ahead.
*****
> Efforts to move along a fiscal package in Congress picked up momentum in the past week with Congressional leaders sounding conciliatory, and a bi-partisan group of senators pushing their own $900 billion proposal.
*****
> ‚ÄúIt probably boils down to how much [Senate Majority Leader] Mitch McConnell is willing to deal, and I don‚Äôt know what the answer is to that,‚Äù said Mike Schumacher, head of rate strategy at Wells Fargo. ‚ÄúIf it‚Äôs going to happen, next week is the week. The government runs out of money on Friday. Congress has to come up with a funding scheme.‚Äù
*****
> Strategists have said the two events could be tied, but Congress could also push through a spending resolution without including stimulus. Some programs will expire at the end of the month, if Congress does not provide funding, including unemployment benefits for millions of Americans.
*****
> The on again, off again stimulus talks have led to skepticism in the market, and sets it up for a move higher if there is anything officially announced. ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fully baked in. I would say the stimulus is a positive catalyst, unless it‚Äôs less than $900 billion,‚Äù said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities.
*****
> While stocks surged in the past week, bond yields also moved higher. Yields move opposite price, and bond yields have been rising on stimulus expectations. More spending means more debt, and that sends rates higher.
*****
> The 10-year was at 0.97% Friday, and appeared ready to move back to the 1% level for the first time since March.
*****
> ‚ÄúIs it the case here, stimulus is already factored in, and will people take their money and run?‚Äù said Schumacher.
*****
> The S&P 500 gained 1.7% in the past week, ending Friday at 3,699, a record high. The Dow also ended up 1% at a record 30,218, and Nasdaq gained 2.1% to a record 12,464.
*****
> # Getting jabbed
> Vaccine news has been a catalyst for the market‚Äôs surge since early November, when Pfizer first revealed the high efficacy of its vaccine. Since then Moderna and Astra-Zeneca both revealed results of their own vaccines.
*****
> A Food and Drug Administration advisory committee meets Thursday on emergency use authorization for the Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine.
*****
> ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre starting to roll it out in the U.K, and that‚Äôs something that‚Äôs going to be watched here to see how it unfolds,‚Äù said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist Prudential Financial. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the next issue for the market. The deliveries, the distributions. Are people being jabbed? These are all questions the market is concerned about about because they‚Äôre looking forward to it unrolling smoothly in the U.S.‚Äù
*****
> About 3 million people will be vaccinated in the initial rollout. Moderna‚Äôs vaccine is expected to be approved the following week, and by year-end both vaccines are expected to reach 20 million people in the U.S.
*****
> ‚ÄúThe vaccine news has started to see a bit of diminishing return in terms of its wow factor,‚Äù said Hogan. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs going to be some volatility around the logistics.‚Äù
*****
> Krosby said the virus remains in the forefront for the market because of the continuing spread and its economic impact as activities are shut down. California Thursday announced new restrictions with stay at home advisories in some regions.
*****
> ‚ÄúThe big question is how long does the Covid surge last?‚Äù Krosby said.
*****
> The virus shutdowns appear to be behind a slowdown in the labor market, and economists say it could slow activity into the first quarter. November job growth of 245,000 was about 200,000 less than expected. That makes Thursday‚Äôs weekly jobless claims more important for markets.
*****
> There is also CPI and PPI inflation data Thursday and Friday.
*****
> ‚ÄúThere is this push pull in the market regarding inflationary pressures,‚Äù said Krosby. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not expected, which is why if it does print higher, it could ignite the conversation regarding inflation.‚Äù

> # Stocks and Bonds Both in Rally Mode

> When it comes to equity market performance in a given month, it doesn't get much better than November. While the S&P 500's total return of 10.95% in the month was only the second-best monthly performance of the year, it was still enough to rank as the third-best month for the S&P 500 in the last thirty years and just the ninth month since 1980 that it was up 10%+.

> The chart below shows the S&P 500's annualized total return over the last one, two, five, ten, and twenty years and compares the current returns to the historical average. For the last year, the S&P 500's total return has been 17.5% which is nearly six full percentage points higher than the historical average. For the last two years, the annualized return has been nearly as strong at 16.8%, and it is actually even stronger relative to the historical average of 10.5%. Moving further out the time horizon, the S&P 500's annualized returns drift lower, and while the five and ten-year annualized returns are greater than average, the S&P 500's annualized gain of 7.3% in the last 20 years is more than 3.5 percentage points below the historical average of 10.9%.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120120-SP-500-Act-vs-Avg.png))**

> The last couple of years haven't just been strong for equities. Over the last year, long-term US Treasuries, as measured by the Merrill Lynch 10+ Year US Treasury Index, have rallied 15.7%, which is more than six full percentage points greater than the historical average of 9.5%. Over the last two years, returns have been even stronger with an annualized gain of nearly 20%, or more than double the historical average of 9.1%! While the last two years have been strong for US Treasuries, the last five, ten, and twenty years have all seen returns of between one and two percentage points below their historical average.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120120LT-Treas-Act-vs-Avg.png))**

> Lately, when you see rallies in the equity market, it tends to be accompanied by a decline in treasuries as yields rise. In November, though, that wasn't the case. Even with the S&P 500 up 10.95%, long-term US Treasuries rallied just over 1%. So how uncommon is it for stocks to rally like they did in November while bonds also rally. Actually, it is not very uncommon at all. The table below shows the nine months since 1980 where the S&P 500's total return in a given month was 10% or more, and of those months, long-term treasuies also rallied in every month but one (October 2011).

> # Manufacturer Recovery Continues

> This morning, the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) released a less positive outlook for the US manufacturing sector. The headline number for ISM's Manufacturing index fell from 59.3 last month down to 57.5. A drop was expected, but the actual results were worse than the drop to 58.0 that had been forecasted. That reading indicates that the manufacturing sector continued to grow in November but at a slower rate than October.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120120-ISM-Headline.png))**

> Similar to the various Federal Reserve bank surveys from around the country, breadth in the November report was more negative than in recent months. Of the ten indices excluding the headline number, only three were higher in November: Backlog Orders, Supplier Deliveries, and Export Orders. Additionally, two indices‚ÄîCustomer Inventories and Employment‚Äîshowed contractionary readings.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120120-ISM-Table1.png))**

> One theme of the report was that orders remain very healthy. New Orders fell from 67.9 to 65.1, but that is a sixth consecutive month of expansionary readings. Although the index was lower this month, meaning new order growth decelerated, it remains in the top decile of historical readings. As new orders have continued to grow, so too have backlogs. The index for Backlog Orders has continued to press higher, rising to 56.9 from 55.7. That is in the 88th percentile of all months and is now at the highest level since August of 2018. Demand continues to improve with new orders coming in at a historically strong pace, even though it is slower than last month, and order backlogs have once again risen as a result.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120120-ISM-Orders.png))**

> As new order growth decelerated, so too did production. The index fell from 63.0 in October to 60.8 last month. That is still consistent with growth (readings above 50) in production but at the slowest rate since June. One factor that potentially had an impact on the slowdown in production is issues with suppliers. The index for Supplier Deliveries rose for the fourth month in a row in November and reached the highest level since May. Higher readings in the Supplier Deliveries index indicates longer lead times and vice versa. In other words, products from suppliers have been taking longer to reach manufacturers, in turn, impacting productivity.

> Although suppliers appear to have some constraints and production has slowed slightly, business inventories rose for the second month in a row even as more and more firms report that customer inventories are too low. The index for Customer Inventories now sits in the bottom 2% of historical readings after dropping another 0.4 points in November. At 36.3, the index is at the lowest level since June of 2010. That low reading can be considered positive for future production.

> # Big Gains In November Steal From Santa

> What a month November was! Here are some of the highlights:

> * Best month for Dow since January 1987 (11.9%) and best November since 1928
> * Best month ever for the STOXX 600 (16.7%)
> * Best month ever for the Russell 2000 (18.3%)
> * Best month for the S&P 500 (10.8%) and Nasdaq (11.8%) since April 2020
> * Best month for Dow Transports since October 2011 (12.1%)
> * Best month from PHLX Semiconductor Index since March 2003 (18.4%)
> * Best month for Industrials (16.0%) and Financials (16.8%) since April 2009
> * Second best month ever for energy (28.0%)

> A way better than expected earnings season, a likely split Congress, and major breakthroughs on the vaccine front all helped stocks soar last month,‚Äù explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. ‚ÄúAdd ongoing support from the Federal Reserve as the cherry on top and we are looking at a truly historic month on many levels.‚Äù

> Here‚Äôs all the Dow monthly returns since 1900. Last month was the best return since January 1987. Now before you go out and sell because you see 1987, remember the S&P 500 added another 20% the seven months after the huge gains in early 1987.

> It was the best November for the S&P 500 since November 1928.

> Small caps soared on the likelihood of taxes staying lower due to a divided Congress and vaccine progress, with the Russell 2000 adding more than 18% for the best month ever, topping the previous record from February 2000.

> What happens after a big month? Well, history says a 10% monthly gain is quite bullish. In fact, we had a 10% plus rally back in April 2020 and shared this same chart at that time. Sure enough, returns have been strong this time around as well. ‚ÄúThe bottom line is the huge gains in November could actually be the start of something much stronger,‚Äù according to Ryan Detrick. ‚ÄúAlso, this was the second month of 2020 with a 10% gain. The only other year to do that? 1982, which kicked off a historic bull market.‚Äù

> Turning to December, this month is widely known to be quite bullish, as Santa comes to town, people feel good, and stocks tend to do well. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, since 1950, December has been the second best month of the year, with only November better. December had been the best month of the year until the historic 9.2% drop in 2018. As a result, December hasn‚Äôt been quite as strong over the past 10 and 20 years.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.2.20-Blog-Chart-4.png?ssl=1))**

> Breaking it down even more, a big rally in November can potentially steal some of December‚Äôs thunder. As after a 5% or 10% rally in November, the returns in December are more muted. The flipside to this though is if the S&P 500 is up more than 10% for the year (like 2020), then stocks have benefited from some performance chasing and have tended to do better.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.2.20-Blog-Chart-5.png?ssl=1))**

> What does it all mean? After the historic move in November we wouldn‚Äôt be surprised to see below average returns in December. We do believe this is a new bull market and lasting economic cycle of growth, but overall sentiment is getting quite stretched and this increases the potential for some near-term weakness.

# DISCUSS!

What are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?

*****

I hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading week ahead r/wallstreetbets._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ i‚Äôm certified diamond hands üíé _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ I could have bought a new entry level Porsche or Model 3...Instant autist status confirmed. _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $PSTH - 100% Not PornHub Well PSTH crew, Bill has finally came out and openly called for regulation of the PornHub business in a spread of four tweets this morning.  He is demanding that PornHub have monitors for all media on the site and ID/age verification age for all actors performing all...‚Äùscenes‚Äù (makes me laugh thinking about a chick taking two dicks in the butt as a scene).

[Bills 12/5/20 Tweets](https://twitter.com/billackman/status/1335244145699528704?s=21)

This goes against the PornHub model...also is demanding the business to take on much more labor than its current cash burn rate.  It really makes you wonder how quickly rumors make it up the chain to senior management.

Outside of just the sheer amount of labor involved with trying to legitimize these businesses (does not fit the Q1 2021 timeline to get these guys above the board) there is no possible way that Bill, Baupost, Guggenheim, the Ontario teachers union would be seeded so heavily in the SPAC just for it to come out as PornHub and hounded for supporting a business who profits off of the exploitation of Minors and Rape.

[Profiting off Rape Videos](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.albawaba.com/amp/node/pornhub-actively-profited-my-rape-online-calls-shut-website-down-amid-human-trafficking)

So currently Stripe is still on the Table with the moves to Hire SEC compliance auditors and a Head of investor relations - the Brothers have just recently said not going to do an IPO. They are clearly gearing up for a move towards the public markets leaving a DPO or SPAC reverse merger on the table.

[No to IPO](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.independent.ie/business/stripe-co-founder-john-collisonis-bullishon-post-brexit-uk-andsays-no-ipo-or-banking-planned-39818524.html)

Or we could be holding massive bags of Inspire Brands since it fits into his last play with BurgerKing then merging to create $QSR. Inspire...Arby‚Äôs (We have the meats), Chads favorite BWW and some tacos that only people with two first names know about.

I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs going to be the meats...but just in case I‚Äôll drop a 10 min looped video of the Slogan so you can hype yourself up.

[Arby‚Äôs : WE HAVE THE MEATS (10 min loop)](https://youtu.be/H6J3DzfE7IQ) 

LOTS of Shares @ $23.15avg

Summary : Not PornHub, Maybe Stripe...hopefully not inspire brands. This does show that Bill is actively managing retail investor hearts and minds. Hi Bill‚Äôs analyst team - let him know that Herbalife is totally a Ponzi scheme...that should of worked out üëãüèª

Edit - Marco you have little tiny hands made of paper_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ GME Gang checking in When I first joined this sub, I was a proud member of PRPL Gang. Ever since then I‚Äôve been looking for the next train to jump on. 

I was on the BABA train until Xi sent us back to the Ming Dynasty. 

After reading what at first I thought was softcore porn(I was undeniably stiff while reading through), I realized it was actual DD.

I sold all my current positions, and went all in on GME.

I want to pay off my house within the next couple months. My wife also deserves a boyfriend that‚Äôll treat her right. 

Either way, win-win. 

36k in 4/16/21 25c

Also picked up 9 shares cuz I don‚Äôt like leaving any buying power on the table.

[Positions](https://imgur.com/gallery/sKBrWnF?s=sms)_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Macerich (Mac) might be a great option to get in on re the mall game? Diversification play is strong don‚Äôt tell me it isn‚Äôt Macerich (MAC) is the biggest mall stock in America. Thousands of high grade retail properties across the country.

Malls have been quiet af on wsb bets and I ask you, WHY?

A lot of fear around the mall sector with COViD obviously but with 2021 growth projections and spending projections and with vaccines on the road maybe it‚Äôs time to take a look at this heavy hitter. It‚Äôs been the most hit of the big mall stocks ytd but oddly enough have the best books. Morningstar has them uncertain but extremely undervalued. Lots of insane price targets from current levels.

Big enough to backstop itself too and likely buyback a ton during recovery.

Still holding... _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ NNOX - radiologist's DD I've been lurking here for years for the hilarious memes. It's time for me to actually contribute something.

I've been a radiologist for years. I watched NNOX's RSNA (Disneyland for radiology) presentation. I attended RSNA virtually for professional reasons of course. I'm going to keep this as short and simple as possible. 

Background on NNOX and x-rays

NNOX proposes a room-temp, ?cheaper electron gun to make x-rays, as opposed to the currently used hot electron gun. Keep in mind x-rays have a lot more parts than just the electron gun (target, bucky, brightness control). X-rays are used in radiographs (2D picture), tomosynthesis (fancy x-ray that allows you to determine depth, requires 180degrees view), and CT scans (requires 360degrees view). 

What did NNOX present?

A human hand radiograph and dummy tomosynthesis using their gun. Nothing I saw was technologically shocking. In fact, I read hundreds of radiographs and dozens of tomo images this week. Side note, him comparing his hand x-ray next to Dr. Rotengen's first medical x-ray from >100years ago was a little tachy, like putting your selfie next to a portrait of jesus. 

Sentiment

Very few people have heard of them in the professional imaging community. I can't find any scientific papers about their tech. Kinda sus...

Regulatory

I'm sure they'll get their 510(k) approved. That's a really low bar. 

My thoughts on their proposal

Pay-per-scan x-ray, AI/cloud/network/\*insert tech buzzword here\*-based interpretation. Major healthcare systems just would not go for that. EVen assuming their tech is both cost-effective and non-inferior, their proposal disrupts (not in a good way) too many things simultaneously (radiologists' and technologists' workflow, reimbursement, existing vendors etc.). Don't get too excited about AI in radiology btw. It's underwhelming at best. 

I'm sure they have valid use cases though - such as rural areas, developing countries (if you're investing, think about the TAM here). I believe their team isn't out to scam people, like NKLA or Theranos. I just wish they would open their technology to peer review and quash any doubts. 

My positions

No position in NNOX. I don't feel like backing or shorting them. Unless something changes, I'll just watch from the sidelines. 

If I turn out to be horribly wrong, feel free to rub it in.

With Docebo Learn (LMS), enterprises have the ability to centralize and organize courses, distribute and manage online and instructor-led courses, track certifications and measure results with dashboards and custom analytics. Docebo Learn (LMS) is powered by AI, automatically tagging learning content and making it easier to find.

Docebo also provides accompanying modules to Docebo Learn include Docebo Coach & Share (AI Powered Social Learning)**,** enabling learning in the flow of work with informal and experiential learning opportunities and Docebo Perform (skills gap management), helping organizations empower their people through skills gap analysis and improving employee competencies with targeted learning programs based on the current and future skills need of your business.

&#x200B;

# Customers:

Docebo has over 2,000 business customers, including the following:

**Thomson Reuters, Heineken, DocuSign, OpenTable, Wal-Mart, and** ***Amazon***\*\*.\*\*

They recently secured a contract with Amazon to provide the training and certification for AWS. This is huge for obvious reasons.

&#x200B;

# Financials:

Docebo isn't profitable (duh), but they have massive revenue growth. For Q3, their revenue grew 60% YoY, with over 10% quarterly revenue growth.

Stock is currently valued at $1.46B. Considering their growth, recently securing their largest contract, and potential upside at less than $1.5B, I think there is massive potential here.

# 

# Everything else:

Docebo IPO'd literally two days ago, so you still have time to get in \*early\*. Wouldn't that be nice? Getting into a stock \*before\* the 200% run up? Obviously there's more risk but you know for sure you aren't buying the top of a pump.

With WFH being a more permanent change in corporate culture, Docebo will be at the forefront of a changing trend and will continue to be in significant demand.

Could potentially expand into University and K-12 education in the future as another avenue for growth. With online and hybrid education becoming bigger, tools like Docebo will be extremely useful.

Retard factor: It's an SaaS cloud computing AI company. How many of these that recently IPO'd haven't gone up 1000 fucking percent?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ When's the GME investor meeting for its 5th largest holder? **Not even fake entries can stop us. We are now the 5th largest holder of GME.**

There were a lot of fake entries, so let me address that.

**1) These guys are not good at what they do**

Most of the fake entries are obvious, for example [here](https://imgur.com/YDgeFOm) and [here](https://imgur.com/DamT0zE).

Others are less obvious, with random numbers spread out over a wider period of time. But it's not easy to create legit-looking entries and have an impact since they can't see the whole data set.

There were so many that I couldn't go through all the responses in a detailed way, and was more conservative to exclude more responses than necessary. Unfortunately, I'm also hiding the category column and grouped duplicates, outliers, fake entries into the Excluded category so that I don't provide any helpful feedback to fakers. Apologies for removing transparency for the sake of countering spoilers.

If we really wanted to stop the fakers, we would ask for email addresses, but then no one would fill out the form. But it doesn't matter anyways, because...

**2) Fake entries don't even matter much, since it just has to be in the ballpark**

Surveys have a huge margin of error and only have to be directionally correct (see recent political polls). The fakers think they're playing 4D chess but are actually playing Candyland... and losing to 4 year-olds. They have the logical skills of GME shorts (which they probably are). 

**3) The main benefit of the survey is social proof**

From all the responses and all the shares, it's obvious we are a force to be reckoned with. We hold great power, and with great power come great tendies. The next time you get weak hands (next Wed), remember everyone else holding until a squeeze. Even if you have the most delicate, princess hands, hold at least through Q4 earnings and the annual shareholder meeting in April.

This has been talked about here for months now so bear with me as I needed a place to rant.

Like many, I‚Äôve been following most of these EV companies since the summer. I mean who isn‚Äôt enticed by seeing people make 300% in a month? It‚Äôs completely rationale to want and get in on the action. Hell, I consider myself a conservative investor and even I‚Äôve made money on some of these names so I guess you can call me a hypocrite for even writing this.

At some point though one has to recognize just how irrational this has become. No revenue until 2025? No problem, here‚Äôs a $17 BILLION market cap (talking about you quant scape). Go onto any EV/SPAC forum or Stocktwits and dare to question a valuation or why a stock tripled in a week. Ask about the potential dilution from warrants or PIPE shares set to go out. You‚Äôll likely just get a cocky response about having FOMO. These bulls are getting so caught up in the moment with short term gains, it reminds of those 2 Florida real estate guys from The Big Short:

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Mfu_iFS-UY8

Take PIC for example. Traded around its NAV (basically a price floor before merger) for months before abruptly surging. Nothing has changed about the company -  no new catalysts other than rumors of a potential merger date which is widely expected. What is the rationale for paying double what the company was valued at a couple weeks ago? These SPACs are becoming commodities in a sense that it‚Äôs solely supply/demand driven by hype and literally nothing else. 

I guess to me the worst part of all this and why it bothers me so much is that 99.9% of the time it will be that average Joe who eventually loses cause they put too much of their savings into a SPAC at $50 after watching some pumper from YouTube who used bright colors and 500% gains In the thumbnail. 

You know who wins 99.9% of the time? Institutions and hedge funds. They are eating this up. Whether it is just shorting these risky stocks or taking advantage of the arb opportunities. I‚Äôve counted 6 recently merged SPACs that have significant spreads between the common stock and warrants. Arbitrageurs are locking in these gains - eventually taking retail money. 

I know I sound lame but this EV hype is getting dangerous and people need to be aware of how this will end. Some will make money short term and know when to get out but a lot of ignorant people are going to lose money once the dust settles with all this.

I'm not so sure anyone has actually done their DD, numbers aside, their YouTube channel is filled with videos of them everywhere, have a look and make informed decision based on that and other factors._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ MUFG DD TL;DR: MUFG's price is way under the actual value of the stock. The MUFG $5 2/19/21 Call option at .10 is beyond undervalued.

Yesterday, I posted my [gains chart for the past month](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k6u2m2/thank_you_all_for_changing_my_life/) where I've consistently been moving up to what amounted to a +780.93% return on investments. I did this through personal research into stocks, statistics, value ratios, and game theory. I've listened to what successful people were doing on this sub and modified it for my own personal strategy.

People have been asking what my positions were so I've decided to start doing write ups. I'm currently invested in 12 companies, most which have already made me profits. My strategy is simple, find companies that are very undervalued and compare the risk to reward ratios for the various call options.

Today, I want to tell you about MUFG. 


**Value Ratios**


Earning per share - .24

Price per Book - .36

Projected Earning Growth - .83

Annual Dividend is at 5.29%

These numbers by themselves tell me that the current price of MUFG is way below what the actual value of the stocks are. These value ratios mean that the stock price is heavily incentivized to go up.

This company has already hit two major floors, one being the major sell-off since it's high at just over $8 down to a floor of around $5, and a floor of $3.43 after the Coronavirus sell-off. I'm not worried about this stock crashing anymore because it has already crashed as hard as it can. It is currently making it's recovery.

In January, Biden will take over as president and I anticipate many policies will be made to get an actual economic recovery underway. I don't believe this has been priced into MUFG's current price yet. 

I understand this is a Japanese company, but we have to understand that the stocks in an American stock market are pushed mainly by American investors. Once more Americans have disposable income, there will be more money thrown into the stock market, and I believe that if the actual value of MUFG doesn't entice investors, it's 5.29% dividend will.

Options for this stock are pretty low volume. I bought 50 shares of MUFG $5 2/19/21 at an average of .12 per share. This is a price I would expect for a weekly expiration, not one in February. In order to profit, the stock needs to hit $5.13 by 2/19.

The floor of this stock before the Pandemic was already at $5 and was making a recovery before Covid struck. I don't see how this stock does not eventually go back up to it's floor of $5, if not surpass that floor and go on to $6 or $7.

Again, at calls prices at .10, I felt that it would be ludicrous to not throw something in and see if I'm right.

After it's first major sell off, MUFG hovered around $5 a share before it started going back up. This was stopped by the Coronavirus outbreak, which caused another sell off to $3.43 in March. Ever since then, this stock has been making a slow, but steady climb up.

The stock has already grown 28% since hitting it's floor in March. It showed recent highs of 4.62 on 11/17 and 11/24. In order for it to hit 5.13, the stock needs to grow just 16.85% more.

Unless something crazy happens, I don't see how this stock doesn't hit at least $5.13 by the time this option expires. I honestly wouldn't be surprised if this stock was around $6 or $6.5 by the time all is said and done.

Once people realize the value of this company, people will buy shares. Once people buy shares, people will realize that the options are valuable. Once people realize that, the price of the option should go up.

For $12 and option, I am giving myself the opportunity to make a huge return on investment if my math and logic are right. If it doesn't hit, I've really not lost that much money.

How did I make 780.93% return on the stock market this past month? These are the types of bets I make. I've had more hits than misses, and the hits easily outweigh the misses.

If you liked this write-up and would like more, I'm happy to present write-ups for some of my other positions. I have call options for TROX (Already up 59.22% with an expiration in 2/19), UNM (bought at .20, up to .53, exp. 3/19), KNOP, LFC, SPTN, GTN, PTVE, AMKR, CS, and TKC. Please fill free to nitpick, ask questions, or shoot my theory down.

Don't rely on TA alone. The market sentiment was weak this week because of the SaaS sector earnings risks and the desire of hedge funds to get in cheaper for a second December rally. HOHOHO.

Salesforce got hammered to create enough delta for a gap up back to $250+ for accumilation. 

Snowflake couldn't stay down and its valuation is absurd, approxiamtely the size of IBM.

Palantir will retest $30 and breakout, just because SNOW did. ($370s) It's up to 2.5X PLTR market capitalization with half the revenue and an operating loss of 14 million. These SNOW investors paid up early for next year 2022. All the Warren Buffett hype and it's paid for WallStreet IPO client/Brokerage PR bias shilling (even by Cramer who won't support PLTR because of the Direct Listing model as an ex-hedge fund manager)

Facebook's underwriters were¬†Morgan Stanley,¬†J.P. Morgan,¬†Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, Barclays and Allen & Co. - and they fucked Facebook with a botched roadshow and  didn't say anything meaningful to shore up its 16 month share price collapse. 

They were too busy being bearish on FB and probably shorted it themselves, especially Goldman Sachs. 

Peter Thiel is a Director on the Facebook Board and remembers what low value paying $350 million for IPO offers.

Thiel and Karp dumped very cheap shares on the first trading day to provide liquidity and Wall Street was (by law very neutral but with a bearish vibe with chicken little risky risky!!!) 

This company would have been IPO listed at $35 a share, still making it much cheaper than the Snowflake IPO. But you can't withhold Wallstreet its tendie tribute. Thiel took it directly to the exchange. 

Meme stock or not, I'm disappointed to see the lack of faith in this company because of a broad market shakeout. $21 was a great entry point, but people expect to realize their ideal oversold wet dream. The Germans are bullish still calling it the next Tesla fairy-tale story. Karp is phil-German and speaks fluently while studying in Frankfurt for years and considers it his cultural homeland. Thiel is German American. So was Wernher Von Braun...*cough Elon Musk the South African/Canadian of Dutch ancestory.

## NIO Recap

**0DTE Prediction you should have chosen from the last post:**

* *"If NIO breaks support at 44.06 ish or bounces off resistance at 47.85 ish, expect downwards PT of 44.03 - 38.53 and below.*
* *Play: 42p 12/04 exp or 43p 12/04 (only play in the morning)"*

## Today's Price Movements

**Monthly Prediction you should have chosen from the last post:** 

* *"If NIO breaks support at around 44.41, look for 37.32 by 12/7 - 12/9 and 35.97 by 12/8 - 12/14."*
* *Play $30p 12/16 exp"*

&#x200B;

**Monthly Outlook**

On the 1D timeframe, NIO doesn't have support until 33.56. However, a pivot point sits at 40.54.

Theoretically, a pivot point is a price level used by professional traders to assess whether prices are bullish or bearish.

"If the prevailing market price is above the base pivot point, it suggests bullishness. If the market is below the base pivot, it suggests a bearish tenor."

On 12/2, NIO reached through the pivot point and jumped back up, creating a long wicked heilkin ashi. Notice how the open and high prices are currently synched on the downtrend? Theoretically, this indicates a STRONG bearish momentum. 

The next support level on the 1D timeframe sits at 33.16

1. If TSLA breaks through resistance at 595.68, look for a price target of 621.85 between 12/4 - 12/8+

TSLA extended its uptrend support and has currently wedged itself into a rising wedge (bearish). 

&#x200B;

**12/7 Weekly Outlook**

Tesla needs a nice pop on Monday to the resistance of the rising wedge, which is right near the resistance level of 622.66. It exceeds that price, then the bearish wedge has failed, and TSLA's sentiment will be bullish.

* *Play 34c 12/11 exp. or 34c 12/18 exp*
* *If PLTR breaks support around 22.86 the look for a PT of 21.22 - 16.02 between 12/11 and 12/18 (For some reason, I didn't include a position for this possibility. For next weeks prediction that will drop Monday morning, ill provide a prediction)*

&#x200B;

**Monthly Outlook**

PLTR is deciding whether to bounce off uptrend support or leap out. We will have a more precise direction at close on Monday. 

## Today's Price Movements

Open: 24.88

High: 25.24

Low: 23.51

Close: 23.85

&#x200B;

It would have helped if you didn't open a weekly/monthly position because PLTR didn't close around 27.48, and I didn't provide a position for the bearish possibility.

0DTE Prediction you should have chosen from the last post:

* If PLTR bounces off resistance at 24.37, look for a price target around 22.36 - 18.64.
* Play 22.5p 12/04 exp

**I'll mark this one as a loss. Not good enough.**

Thanks, 

NightMan_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Fellow autists, it's been a wild ride. Net green after almost a year. _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ It's a sort of stimulus injection _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ GHIV TO THE MOON üöÄüöÄ (DD) 
Real estate investor here. If no one buys a home at all in 2021 buying GHIV still works and this is why:

Homeowners rolling over old mortgages into new ones accounted for 62 percent of all lending activity in the second quarter of 2020, up from 54.5 percent of loans in the first quarter of 2020 and from 39.6 percent in the second quarter of 2019.

Even your grandma is getting a refi for 2.5%, and she owned her house outright. Good job grandma.

Metro areas with at least 1 million people that saw refinance activity at least doubled, year over year, in the second quarter of 2020 included¬†Washington, DC¬†(up 219.9 percent);¬†Milwaukee, WI¬†(up 213.1 percent);¬†Austin, TX¬†(up 211.9 percent);¬†Raleigh, NC¬†(up 205.3 percent) and¬†Birmingham, AL¬†(up 198.4 percent).

United Wholesale Mortgage (UWM) underwrites loans for mortgage brokers, banks and credit unions. It doesn't lend directly to borrowers.

They play the middle. They don't hold the loans. They don't employ bankers. They use independent brokers. They are transactional, and there is ALOT of transactions in this current low interest economy.

Homeowners deal with the company's loan servicing department. Founded in 1986, United Wholesale Mortgage is headquartered in Pontiac, Michigan, and is one of the top wholesale lenders in the country.

Ok, cool but what makes them special?

United Wholesale Mortgage (UWM), the #1 wholesale mortgage lender, set a company record of $107.7 billion in mortgage loan volume in 2019, more than doubling it‚Äôs 2018 production of $41.5 billion. In doing so, it broke the wholesale industry record of $103.3 billion of mortgage loan volume previously set in 2005 by Countrywide Financial. UWM also secured the title of #1 wholesale lender for the fifth year in a row which has never been done before in the industry.

These guys are literally the McDonalds of mortgages. Their rates are the lowest, their fees are the lowest, and they are the most competitive all around. Their growth and numbers prove it. 

Now before you wet your pants with excitement. 2021 will see some downturn in the housing market due to foreclosures. This may or may not effect the mortgage industry on paper, but it could drive down sentiment. So if you have the patience, this is a solid play for long term with room for alot of growth.

Either way, if you don't buy the stock, you need to give these fuckers a call. 1.99% on a 30 year fixed if you qualify, and if you would save money by getting the mortgage refi, use that savings to buy the stock, then you don't have to come out of pocket.

After writing "The Gayest Gay Bear Post in WSB History," I am now balls deep in SPY puts and VXX calls, up to a whopping 25k total with nearly 10k of that expiring on December 18th.

I am so confident we are going down next week that I'm willing to make another bet. I will donate $100 to the top 10 upvoted commentors below if SPY closes below $360 by next Friday.

On the other hand, if SPY closes above $375 next Friday I will get a tattoo of Jpow's face above the words "Don't Fight The Fed" on my ass. This will serve as a lifelong reminder that the Fed does have true power and isn't a deflationary scam operation pumping up meaningless bank reserve accounts which aren't being lent out and aren't entering the economy (which is the actual truth). If anyone wants to go ahead and design a black-and-white Banksy style image of that for me ahead of time I'll pay you for the efforts if I decide to use it. But I won't need to because this shit is GOING DOWN FOLKS!!!

This is the single largest bet I've ever made on a single play in my 20 years of trading. I wouldn't have done that if I wasn't extremely confident in my thesis and my timing. Most of you will all repeat the same thing. "You are early, should have gone for X month." As if you retards could time a market crash lmfao...

When the dust settles I will either post gain porn or loss porn. I will either have a tattoo reminding me of my worst bet ever and the need to be safer in the future, or I will have cash taken from the same retarded hands who bought the top and called me an idiot while doing it...

Plus some other random shit that doesn't matter much._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Listen retards, CRM should be your major easy-money move next week (fool-proof instructions inside) **Basics**

Salesforce is a San Fransisco company that offers **C**ustomer **R**elation **M**anagement software (and hence the symbol CRM). It's not a  joke company like many other shilled on WSB. Salesforce has a market cap of $200 billion and is one of the 30 companies listed in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA).

**What Happened**

This is the price chart for Salesforce (CRM) last week:

https://preview.redd.it/9sqm4nur2a361.jpg?width=300&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e71b4aee8595c1e3a5a2f1220fedc017c21153f2

The sharp drop happened right after the earning call. Was the earnings number disappointing? No, in fact, it was stellar. While the average expected EPS was $0.75 per share, the actual number turned out to be $1.74.

But Salesforce also announced that it's in the process of acquiring Slack (WORK) for 27.7 billion dollars. Some experts said Salesforce is overpaying for Slack and a huge sell-off followed, resulting in a 40 billion drop in Salesforce market cap.

So, think about it. Salesforce acquires a company for 27.7 billion and its market cap goes down by 40 billion. In other words, 2+2=3, while usually with a merger you expect 2+2=5.

**What Happened Next**

After the initial shock, analysts and the public started to reassess the situation, and many actually praised the acquisition.

Jim Cramer (the guy who is the WSB for boomers) [said "Salesforce Has 100% Upside After Buying Slack"](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jim-cramer-salesforce-100-upside-173302345.html). He's been shilling the stock on his show every day as well.

Multiple analysts upgraded their Salesforce recommendation to Strong Buy and raised their price target.

Since then, the initial price gap has been filled a little. The price is currently about $226. But a full recovery to pre-EC prices ($240s) and higher seems imminent.

Traders have a "3-Day Rule" according to which they don't touch a stock that has fallen sharply and suddenly for 3 days to let it sink to its lowest and see where it goes from there. Those 3 days for CRM are passed and it seems to be rising.

**What's Coming**

[Salesforce Investor day](https://investor.salesforce.com/events-and-presentations/event-details/2020/Investor-Day-2020/default.aspx) is on Tuesday (Dec 8) in the morning. They will probably clarify the necessity of the slack acquisition and their plans to profitably integrate it into their core business.

Also, a lot of institutions see this drop as a good opportunity to get in, so the demand is high.

**What Positions**

Do NOT buy weekly or far OTM options. Consider the following (ranked from riskiest to safest):

\- 230C 12/18/2020

\- 250C End of year-February

\- 270C March-May 2021

\- 300C June-July 2021

\- The stock (CRM) if you want to hold for 6 months or more.

**When to Buy**

Do not FOMO. I don't want you to buy in pre-market or when it starts high on Monday and then curse my name when it goes down some in 2 hours.

I think this will certainly go up, both short term and long term,  but there will be dips along the way. Wait for the dips to buy in.

Regardless of outcome Monday morning will be a good time._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ FREE MONEY ALERT [2]: Best Buy ($BBY) ATM, 1/22 EXP 105C This one is quick since the CRM alert, don‚Äôt expect them this often. For those of you who missed the CRM Calls purchase point Wednesday morning and know what the fuck you are doing, I think writing the shit out CRM Puts is still a money move. But I suppose some people might want a cheaper call premium play, with less news and shit, and most you fucking idiots need all the help you can get. 

BBY is another strong options play, I‚Äôll be looking to purchase early next week based on futures and overall market sentiment. But another drop today closed the deal for me. Sticking with ATM calls due to low cost, and we could definitely fall into the 95 range briefly. 

Weekly puts are incredibly cheap, consider mildly protecting your call position over the next two weeks if investing significant equity (sell them fast though!). But this decline is undoubtedly near an end and this bitch is turning around shortly for a couple of reasons. 
Don‚Äôt get too technical about the purchase point, current market value is solid as it is. 

First off I don‚Äôt like this company in terms of a long term prospect, given the Covid sales bump combined with the vaccine news, but cases are worse then they‚Äôve ever been. Essentially a 9/11 every couple of days.. So that‚Äôs good for this one I guess... but as I will probably explain every time, when I give these alerts I‚Äôm telling you the price will move upwards enough within the expiration date to exceed theta, but I don‚Äôt provide sell points. 

First thing first, the boys at Best Buy are doing a good old fashioned buyback this quarter, so that helps make things guaranteed. We are down well below short moving averages and at our five year moving averages for those of you that give a shit. 

The company has been performing exceptionally during quarantine and has a strong bottom line (Yes I know it went down a bit due to logistical costs of online sales). We will definitely see some positive growth over the next month or two, and it‚Äôs another clear example of a stock that is being majorly oversold post earnings. 

If you start typing under the impression I think BBY is going to fly to 125 in two weeks you‚Äôre a fucking idiot. Don‚Äôt bag hold dumb fucks, especially if you buy OTM calls. 

Don‚Äôt think writing puts is an awful strategy on this one either, but think CRM is still better, and you can soak up way more premium with its current IV and volume._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ A song for the fallen autists. _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Well boys, there ya go. Mostly from last fall but I have finally come to terms with my decisions. Thinking about givin' her another go... _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ THANK you so much WSB, this is awes... oh... oh wait. Shit _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $GME is a SCREAMING buy. But AFTER earnings‚Ä¶.. Obviously, $GME Q4 results are a day of reckoning for this business. I have long been tracking this company but I only recently got in with some skin in the game (disclosure ‚Äì I own \~3000 shares; I am also new to WSB:)). I also think Q3 is an important moment for the company given the institutional dynamics, but **I do NOT think holding through 12/8 would be a good gamble** (which is why you are seeing several people sell their shares to buy in later). Instead, I think there is a better way to play earnings on 12/8.

First off, as everyone knows, Q3 results are going to be ugly. Some have made the argument that the market has already priced this in, but this is only partially true. **Market pricing is dictated by both event-driven probability and hype.** I would guess that the probability of GME missing consensus estimates is \~50/50 (note missing consensus estimates is different from negative growth which is guaranteed in this case). Nobody knows where things will shake out, so the market will price it as such. However, there is a tremendous amount of hype around this stock (for good reason in my humble opinion), which is why I think this stock is trading well heading into an earnings announcement for a turbulent quarter.

Now, **one way to estimate performance is by using credit card activity as a proxy for performance**. We can then use this and compare it to consensus estimates by research analysts:

*Same-Store Sales*

* Telsey: -27.0% (as of 12/2/20)
* Wedbush: -20.0% (as of 12/4/20)

**If you look at credit card data scrapping services, it looks like the quarter will end down around 25 ‚Äì 30%** (based on the service you use). Obviously this is close to the Telsey number, but its worth noting that these credit card services slightly overestimated performance in Q2 (so the number will likely be closer to -30%). **Therefore, I have a feeling that this stock is going to sell-off significantly**, **making it a much better entry point versus pre-earnings.**

**Personally, I am still long this stock, but it seems like the stock is going to drop in the immediate aftermath of the earnings release, which is why I will be holding off from buying on Monday. I‚Äôm definitely going to scoop up some more after earnings however!**

FEAC is a SPAC being used to send the company Skillz Inc public. A SPAC, In short, is a company that forms for the sole purpose of bringing another company public. The company backing this SPAC is no other than the same which backed Draftkings (Flying Eagle). Flying Eagle‚Äôs CEO is Harry Sloan. He has been in the business a long time. He was a founding investor and board member of a company you might have heard of - Bethesda Games. So either he has a great eye for this or he is super lucky - Time will tell. 

Skillz is an online mobile multiplayer competition platform that helps developers monetize their games. You likely haven‚Äôt heard of most of the games Skillz‚Äôs represents, but your grandma probably has. They are: Solitaire Cube, Blackout Bingo, Pool Payday, 21 Blitz and more. All of these are listed on the Apple and Android App Store. All highly rated and with thousands of reviews. The thing that makes them unique vs. other games is that you can 100% legally gamble in them. They accept PayPal and most major credit cards. All withdrawals of winnings can go straight to your bank account. How they managed to get this pass both major App Stores and the US gov I can‚Äôt seem to figure out. 

Noteworthy Facts:
1. Forbes named it on its list of the next ‚ÄúBillion dollar start ups‚Äù. CNBC named Skillz the ‚Äúglobal leader in eSports‚Äù. 
2. Skillz players averages 65 min per day. To put in perspective, Netflix only averages 50 min per day, per user. 
3. They expect user growth to get into the ‚Äúhundreds of millions within the next two years‚Äù. 
4. 10 different SPACS tried to bag Skillz IPO, but they decided to pick Flying Eagle because of Harry Slone‚Äôs success. 
5. Financials: Third Quarter Revenue of $60 Million (Up 92% Year-over-Year), Revenue for Year to Date of $162 Million, (Up 91% Over Prior Year). Full Year Revenue expected at $225 Million. 
6. Working towards being incorporated into Peleton bikes. 

Skillz checks the box on financials. The rest is up to interpretation. The important take aways for me here is that it‚Äôs backed by a guy with a great eye for gaming and a company that has somehow added gambling to these games. I also am seeing little talk about it on stock forms (only 2 posts on WSB in the last 3 months) and the general media for a company that is getting high marks from some major hitters like Forbes and CNBC. It‚Äôs been on a steady rise since it officially announced its IPO on Monday, so don‚Äôt expect a 100% return, but it‚Äôs in no way done. 2 rocket ship emojis

Data on their Factor D drug (PNH target) coming out this weekend, Japan approval on their drug may announce next week as well as their P1 data on an antiviral in investigation against Covid and Yellow fever (YF has a \~25% fatality rate so even the P1 data should show signs of efficacy or not) and maybe an update on their FOP drug.

Company has 150 mil cash, potential to receive 22 mil cash upfront "bonus payment" upon Japan approval announcement along with non dilutive financing!  The new drug approval yesterday means the company moved from \~6 mil rev/quarter to 20 mil rev/quarter overnight with an estimated climb towards 125mil rev/quarter over this year.

This company is in the USA!!!! Let freedom ring!  YOLO!

Looks like a great data/PR update about on BCRX's Factor D drug.  Why does this matter you might ask...  The price of the competitors drug (if you could even consider them that) is still considered to be in the top 10 most expensive drugs in the world for a single targeted disease (PNH).

BCRX's **Factor D drug may be able to tackle PNH along with several other Alternative Complement Pathway disorders & diseases** and **may be revolutionary in the world of medicine** if it even comes close to maintaining the same results through P3 trials as the current dose ranging data has demonstrated._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Economies of Asian countries expected to bounce back faster than others...go long on low value Asian companies _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Ark took a major $14M position in $JD Clearly Ark Investments is not worried about Chinese stocks being delisted.
