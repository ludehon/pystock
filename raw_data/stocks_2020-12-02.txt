"As a software technology company, the unique aspect to consider with Sabre Corp. (NASDAQ: SABR) is its involvement in the global travel industry. The company‚Äôs portfolio caters to airlines, car rental companies, travel agencies, and hotels helping to manage operations like reservations, back-end revenue management, flight crew management, and even flights. Sabre also operates a travel marketplace processing travel arrangements.  Earlier this week the company‚Äôs technology was implemented by Gulf Air, a top carrier in Bahrain. Croatia Airlines, GOL Airlines, and BIDTravel have all recently signed or enhanced agreements with Sabre. 

Considering the SABR stock was trading as low as $3.30 in March, it‚Äôs clear that reopening optimism ‚Äì specifically in the travel industry ‚Äì has helped. This week, shares reached highs of $11.73. Analysts at Deutsche Bank recently boosted their price target on SABR to $12 from $9 but still have a Hold rating on the stock. With the idea that travel picks up because of a vaccine as a solution to treating coronavirus, the backbone/pick and shovel stocks shouldn‚Äôt be forgotten. In Sabre‚Äôs case, the company expects that pent up demand for travel should firmly establish a more profitable recovery from the pandemic."

I am aware that some of you have curious as to why RKT has not taken off already. I wish to know too. I sent some info analysis to an elder of mine who has been showing me some things that he has learned over his decades of investing and he sent me the following reply. 

I hope to get some thoughts on this reply. 

‚ÄúMy reactions to Rocket Mortgage are:
1.If all goes well like their predictions these would be good returns BUT
2. In the 2008 crash one strategy was for a big organization to form a separate mtge
company, and sell the stock in this separate corporate entity. Then the new entity loaded up
with second rate mortgage risks (which of course paid higher interest rates) which the shareholders could (from a practical point of view) not really evaluate. When many of these mortgage borrowers went south and could not pay this had a major impact on the profitability of the overall return of the portfolio of mortgages. This then had a dramatic  effect on the price of the mtge company stock, The losses did not affect the big organization which also benefited from all the underwriting fees which indirectly were paid for by the mtge company shareholders. Many of these holders would not have invested in low quality, high risk mortgages directly if they had known the level of risk they would be running. There is plenty of boilerplate (cover-my-posterior) language in the fine print of what you sent me.‚Äù (Here he is talking about the analysis report I sent him)

‚Äú3. Will the Biden administration promote a booming economy with more regulations and higher taxes?
If the economy slows down the first to suffer will be these lower grade mtge's. I personally don't like
complexity when it can be avoided by a more direct approach. Of course, if interest rates are high enough
an organization can survive even knowing that a number of lenders will fail along the way. Loan sharks
have played this game forever. Maybe that is not what they are doing here but I see no references stating that Rocket is seeking only high quality lending risks--the kind JPM is glad to issue loans to itself.
I may be wrong but I did not get a "good feeling" reading this material. All these so called certified
evaluators have (as pointed out) some conflicts of interest because they are paid by JPM, What does
an independent evaluator who sells only info to its customers and has no advertising or other relationship
with a "Rocket" think? Probably no one is covering this entity so you will never know.Do you want to be
a high interest rate money lender to a group of higher risk borrowers? If so, Rocket might be just the ticket.‚Äù_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Where do you find out about stocks before they pop?

Buy Walmart!
Trust me, You don‚Äôt want to miss out


Overall:
Walmart‚Äôs new online Walmart plus service is very enticing and costs little to run compared to Amazon. They could become the future Amazon if the amount of people with Walmart Plus continues to grow. They should make a lot of money online during the Christmas season and pandemic and you should expect very high earnings going forward.

Walmart is making a push into the pharmaceutical sector, investing money into the space. They also announced a healthcare/ health insurance 
program recently. Health is an area of huge potential due to the Pandemic causing focus on the health sector.

Walmart is the largest retail store but was not affected to badly by the pandemic. Since they are the largest retail store you can except the stock to rise after the current restrictions on retail stores are lifted without having to worry about it falling with bad pandemic news.

Walmart is:
- A new online retailer with huge potential 

- Growing in the healthcare and Pharmaceutical industries

-Set up to make money distributing COVID vaccines

- The largest physical retail company in the world. (Physical retail is a sector that goes up a lot with good pandemic news)

These types of stocks are all stocks that people look at to find huge potential in growth. Walmart is really innovating and putting themselves in a position to grow a lot as a company over the next few years. There‚Äôs a chance that they will become the world largest online retailer and worlds largest Pharmacy along with them being the worlds largest physical retail company. That might seem ridiculous but it is entirely possible. If you think this is bullshit I encourage you to read the three news articles below and my in depth analysis of the stock.





Thing to read (references and today‚Äôs news):

1. 
[Understanding Walmart Plus](https://www.forbes.com/sites/joannasciarrino/2020/09/15/walmart-plus-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-new-walmart-delivery-service/?sh=2acacc8b1085)

[Walmart Opening Pharmacies](https://www.fool.com/millionacres/real-estate-investing/articles/walmart-to-open-health-superstores-what-it-means-for-real-estate-investors/)



My Findings:

1. 
Walmart is really pushing their new online store service Walmart Plus. Walmart Plus is like Amazon prime except Walmart Plus offers same day or next day shipping for free on any purchase and same day free grocery delivery. They are one of the only companies in the world that can do this because of their nationwide retail stores. Walmart retail stores near almost every town which allows for the faster delivery than Amazon. This faster delivery will entice people to join Walmart plus and gives them an advantage over Amazon. Faster delivery allows for them to ship perishable goods like groceries because they will stay fresh during the same day shipping. Walmart also can keep costs at a minimum for the service. Unlike Amazon they do not need to pay for huge warehouses and warehouse employees because they have many stores already established. Amazon also has to ship your products across the country first in a semi truck to a warehouse, then from the warehouse onto a separate delivery truck that goes to your house. Amazon has to pay Warehouse costs which include property taxes, upkeep, and the huge initial cost to open a warehouse. They also have to pay employees at the warehouses. They also have to pay for semi trucks, last mile delivery vans and the salaries of the employees driving them (or pay for a service like UPS).
Keep in mind Amazon has become one of the largest companies in the world. Walmart offers faster delivery while avoiding the fees for warehouses (they use their stores instead). They also have much lower costs on delivery. (They ship your products straight from your local Walmart to your house). If Amazon has become one of the top 5 companies in the world imagine the money Walmart will make by offering a similar service with faster deliveries with much less operating cost. With the bump in online sales during the Christmas season, and people turning to online shopping, Walmart can expect to gain a lot of new users on its new Walmart Plus service. This makes Walmart a strong growth tech stock that could become the next Amazon.

2. Walmart is making big moves in the pharmaceutical space. They are opening more pharmacies and putting money into their pharmaceutical programs Walmart announced a new Health and Wellness EVP Dr. Cheryl Pegus, the former Chief medical officer of Walgreens. They should be able to make easy money with covid vaccine distribution and start making more in the pharmaceutical space overall. They are looking to take over CVS as the largest pharmacy In America. (They are currently the second largest) Walmart also started a healthcare program looking to capitalize on the health insurance market and take some of the market from companies like blue cross. They are looking to combine their new ventures into health with Walmart Plus and roll out a program to deliver perceptions to your home. There are rumors Walmart could even be able to deliver covid vaccines to homes once they are available. Take that with a grain of salt as it has not yet been confirmed by Walmart.


3. Walmart is the worlds largest retail chain. You would think that that they should have taken a huge hit with the pandemic like most other retail stores. They did not however and actually reported a 6% average grown in overall sales at retail stores. This is due to Walmart being an essential business because they sell groceries and other essential items. People still shopped at Walmart even with the pandemic going on which makes them a very stable stock. Just because they didn‚Äôt go down with covid does not mean they won‚Äôt go up when it goes away. I expect large gains in the stock once the pandemic is over.

The firm said Palantir is trading at a ‚Äúsignificant premium‚Äù compared with its peers, with its stock more than doubling since it went public Sept. 30.

‚ÄúWith PLTR up 155% since listing with very little change in the fundamental story, the risk/reward paradigm shifts decidedly negative for the shares,‚Äù Morgan Stanley analysts wrote.

Co-founded in 2003 by tech investors Peter Thiel and Joe Lonsdale, CEO Alex Karp and others, Palantir provides data analytics software and services to government agencies, including the Defense Department, the Food and Drug Administration and the intelligence community.¬†It also sells to companies like aircraft manufacturer¬†[Airbus](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=AIR-FR)¬†and energy producer¬†[BP](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=BP.-GB).

‚ÄúWhile strong 3Q20 results highlighting sustained momentum in the government vertical, accelerating growth in the enterprise and record margins of +25% represented a slight fundamental uptick versus initial expectations ‚Äì we believe much of incremental move since 3Q20 results (shares +75% over the past 2.5 weeks) are likely related to factors outside of fundamentals, including strong retail long-interest squeezing strong institutional short-interest,‚Äù Morgan Stanley analysts wrote.

Today their contract expires with Nextar. They have been negotiating and claim Nextar is the devil and is raising prices too high. This could cause exponential customer loss, stock plummet. 

Dish also got into a bidding war and overpaid for SPECTRUM wireless contracts they spent roughly 20 bn to aquire. This was earlier in the decade. However, the time is running out and they have yet to produce the build-out requirements for these by the FCC. The march 2020 deadline already passed and the next step is them failing to meet the 2023 deadline. They will face a 72 million dollar penalty should they fail.

 The bull case here is that sprint and t-mobile merger failed and that Dish received an upgrade to Buy by some analysis because they predict Verizon may want to purchase these contracts for their network so that t-mobile does not obtain it. 

Backstory, I have worked for Dish and they are horrible. Dish loses 671K customers annually. Currently with somewhere around 13.9 million. They also own Sling TV which is terrible and loses large amounts annually. The representatives that enter your home are micromanged into selling a minimum of $34 a job of upcharges on anything from HDMI Cables to full sound systems or smart home devices. 

Dish has cut a huge amount of internal and external workforce this year amongst COVID-19 as well as raising the requirements for technicians to sell more. COVID may have brought in more temporary customers but with this blackout and more annual customer loss than their competitors I see this a potential shockwave into bear territory for the company if they fail to make a deal.

Problem is, it feels as if I'm banking on either the hype of the market, or recommendations from friends & the internet. My most recent loss on Palantir taught me I need a step-by-step process to do so. 

So, what is the best way to go about finding a stock the proper way, specifically for swing trades?

So, I received a stock award from my work. The total amount granted was 400 unvested stocks. For 3 years 1/3 of the stocks will become vested at which point, I'm told, I'll be able to sell the vested stocks at their market value. 

I have a couple of questions, as all of the sites I've used to research use jargon which I'm currently unfamiliar with and its leaving me very confused. 

1. When I received the grant, the per share value was around $150, and is currently sitting at around $300. However the account shows a potential value of over $17,000 (equaling out to about $130 per share for the first 3rd of the shares). I'm wondering where this number comes from and how much I should expect the first 3rd of the shares to be worth when they become vested later this month? - I had expected the number to be much higher. 

2. How long does it typically take from when I try to sell (I assuming a similar process to selling regular stocks - where I will usually do a market order) to the time I should expect to receive funds? (Ballparks of one-two weeks/months is fine)

Especially when some of the larger stocks only increase $1-$4 in a given month-to-month span. Whereas, some smaller ones can increase much quicker.

In the late 90's we had a similar Tech/Digital stock rally. Back then it was web page development and internet providers, now it's electric vehicles and big data. "Stonks" were only going up, up and up. You heard things like - Dude, its a new economy, this is the new normal. This is the future, you can't use old models to define value. Die all boomers and burn traditional stocks (ok I might be exaggerating on this one)

&#x200B;

Anyway, I was a finance major at a prominent university in London, UK. I was destined for greatness (and an trainee spot at Deutche Bank's analyst desk). My friend - let's call him Eli, because his name was actually Eli - was a stock genius. Everybody is a genious in a bull market, put some money in to a company in IT and bam! You had LOL GAINS. Eli was good for about 350kUSD at one point. Or I should say, 350kUSD nominal value in stocks. Because, its not money until you sell. Eli learned the hard way.

&#x200B;

The "dip" came. Eli thought "stonks only go up" I'm gonna "buy the dip". Eli bought and bought, he also had a debt position of about 25% of his portfolio. This increased to 50%. The bank called, Hey Eli - that collateral isn't so hot anymore, pay up dude. Eli paid up. One year later he had -13kUSD on his account for accrued interest rates and trading fees.

&#x200B;

So what's there to learn. Well, depends on how risk averse you are, but I see a lot of new investors that ask about when and how to take home profits. There is no rule or best practice, but here's at least an idea that I'm using myself.

&#x200B;

1. I don't let a stock grow beyond 20% of my portolio, if it does I automatically start scaling back profits
2. I always keep a 10-15% cash position so I can take advantage on dips or other opportunities. This money has had a ridicoulus payback over the years.
3. For every 20% growth I take home 20% of the profit, no matter what. For crazy rockets I might take home more, say half the profit of every 20% growth.

&#x200B;

So what do I do with my profits? Well, I do a few things.

&#x200B;

1. I reinvest them in to other stocks, so I make sure I have a short list of alternatives at all times
2. I put them in the cash position so I can be opportunistic (but still max 15%)
3. I buy my wife or kids presents, I pay off mortgate, I get a nice Rolex or refurbish the house.  Its money. I have money so I can spend it, use it.

&#x200B;

Moral of the story. Make money, you probably won't see another opportunity like the one of the past 6 months. Its not coming back for a while. Don't step out of the market, pick your stocks wisely, keep some cash to pounce on some disappointing Q4's and remember its not money until you sell.

I have been very passionate about investing ever since I started late last year. I finally decided that it's time to share some of my research with the masses. I am now releasing Part 2 of my research article about DraftKings (NASDAQ: DKNG) in the link below. You will be able to see the link to Part 1 within that article. I am a long term investor and I relentlessly research to find companies that I can buy with confidence and hold in my portfolio for a long time. (3 years, 5 years, 10 years, 20 years, etc.). I'm looking for companies that I believe have the potential to 10x within the next 5 to 10 years. I want to know so much about a company and have so much conviction on it that I feel comfortable holding it through big drops in the stock market and adding to my position during these times if I can. In this article I walk you through my framework of trying to figure out if the stock can 10x from here. The factors I consider are: (1) Leadership (2) Risks (3) Price and (4) Growth. You can read it at this link if you like:

Stay diamond handed_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ American not allowed to trade in the UK Some context; I have dual citizenship (American and British), and I currently reside in the UK. I have no US 'home' address.

I'm a newbie to stocks and trading but have taken an interest over lockdown. I've been looking at some apps to start stock trading, namely Revolut and Trading212. The problem I'm having with these apps, as well as other websites, is that as American different tax laws apply to me (unsure about the details). 

Essentially, I go through the sign-up process of these sites/apps and indicate that I'm British, at some point they ask if I hold US citizenship,  when I answer yes to this they prevent me from trading stocks or opening an account. On Trading212, I didn't disclose my US citizenship and through a background check, the same thing happened. 

My friend suggested using an American based trading site, but I tried on a couple of sites and can't create an account without a residential address in the States.

I feel grid-locked and don't know how or if it's possible for me to be able to buy stocks with my circumstances.

 Any help or guidance to push me in the right way would be much appreciated._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Can apply breach the $125 resistance?

I have been looking to get into stocks and was trying to find a good app or website to use from South Africa. The usual suspects being recommended on this subreddit mostly don't work for us here and I've had to shop around a bit. I tried Plus500 recently but quickly found out that they really don't want you to make money on there. After depositing funds, whenever I tried to open a position on something I felt was looking good they would tell me that "certain predetermined trading limitations are in place" and they "cannot specify the exact time when a limitation might be reached or its value". This basically only happened on stocks that were doing well, or looking like they would do well. They then told me the limitations were temporary and the stock would be available for purchase at a later date. Kind of pointless even bothering if that is the case, I would say?

Anyway, I am just looking for an app or website that allows me to do what I want to do when I want to do it without leverage or any other strings attached. I don't want to invest or deposit a lot, I just want to tinker a bit to try get the hang of things with a little extra cash every now and then. I'd obviously love something like Roobinhord, which everyone here seems to use, but that can't be used outside the US as far as I can see.

Thanks in advance for any advice or suggestions. If you dudes want to know anything else just shout and I will reply as soon as I can.

Hey everyone! So, let‚Äôs start with the recap of yesterday as we saw the [NASDAQ COMPOSITE](https://ibb.co/PzNKCYh) leading the way up almost 1,3%, finishing at a new record high, the [SP500](https://ibb.co/syB7wP4) also up over 1,1% and finishing at a new record high, while the [DOW](https://ibb.co/HggpWGF) had smaller gains but was still up to intraday records before finishing over +0,6% for the day. The [VIX](https://ibb.co/SDCq7vf) rose for the day after opening at 20,2 and as you can see in this [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/0n1TDKt) big gains were led by the FAANG stocks with Apple, Alphabet, Facebook and Netflix gaining over 2% for the day while Amazon and Microsoft also were up at least 1%. This pulled the big indexes higher as they account for a big part of them.

Over 60% of companies were advancing on average volume while companies moving above important moving averages continued to climb as we are going into a very risky market, as to many companies are trading high at the moment and are due for a correction. [CHART](https://ibb.co/DfgJ12R)

The biggest gaining [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/T8NPW6W) yesterday were Communications, Financials and Technology with most sectors being in the green, except industrial, as the laggards from yesterday were small cap growth companies and especially those from CHINA, like NIO, Alibaba and others, that have suffered from the recent news that the US is looking to delist some of them if they do not meet new standards. [CHART](https://ibb.co/gmpRVWW)

Here are the most interesting economic events and data for [TODAY](https://ibb.co/cyp7x5W), as we will see how Mortgage Applications and ADP Jobs are going. Afterwards a couple of FED leaders will speak before we can take a look at how the Petroleum Inventories are going.

While [GREAT NEWS](https://ibb.co/1d6y1yh) started to pop in the early morning as the UK has become the first country to authorize the Pfizer vaccine for use.

This news are already baked in the market in my opinion as investors were already expecting this to happen sooner rather than later, but this are still very good news to hear, as a confirmation is still great to have, rather than just expectations. I expect the US will soon follow in the next 10-14 days to approve both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccine, that might just have a bigger impact on the stock market, but I would be careful until then, as we might get a correction in the stock market after this huge rally before we can move on even higher, as I fully expect this bull market to continue into 2021 and 2022.

Well yesterday, as I expected Nikola [tumbled again](https://ibb.co/2hzPCJL) after the insider lockup period expired, as only the possibility of Milton selling his shares has spooked the market after an already bad day with the GM deal disappointing investors. As the original deal is null and void with GM not taking any stake in Nikola or helping with the engineering or manufacturing of the Badger pickup truck. The only good thing in sight for the company is the possible hydrogen fueling station network partnership by year end as announced by the management. I maintain my sell opinion on this stock as I predicted a 15-16$ in the future when the stock was trading over 20, I think it has more room to go down, it might go to single digits in the long run, as the company has become very shady after the fiasco with the misleading tactics and no breaking new fuel cell technology.

On the other hand, Salesforce crushed [earnings](https://ibb.co/XCzz5Mz) expectations, as they beat the EPS by almost 1$ and had a revenue beat of over 160 million$. They also raised [guidance](https://ibb.co/JRf2G3j) for both revenue and EPS for next year way above the consensus while also maintaining cash and equivalents at over $9B, up 45% for the year.

The company also officially [announced](https://ibb.co/whYVfzC) the acquiring of Slack in a deal worth almost $28B. This will result in the Slack software being incorporated in every aspect of Salesforce cloud offering. This 2 will be the biggest competitors yet for Microsoft. So, I believe after the dust settles, and CRM stock finally gets back on track, we will have a good long term growth opportunity with Salesforce.

Slack also reported earnings yesterday after the bell as the company [posted](https://ibb.co/N6Qnw7M) a beat of estimates and an increase in paid customers and billings.

We also got some [numbers](https://ibb.co/6rNGCnZ) from Cyber Monday sales as the spending increase over 15% but, this was not enough to meet all the estimates as holiday shopping has been probably spread through the whole month of November and will continue to go strong in December in my opinion.

While on the economic front news were not so great as the [November ISM](https://ibb.co/3yM4Hwc) index fell shy of expectations with light vehicles [sales](https://ibb.co/PG09TRf) dropping by almost 1 million from last month and are way below the year ago period.

But we did see some big improvements in [construction spending](https://ibb.co/cc5z2wq), as the numbers came in about half a % better than consensus and are up 3,7% year over year while the [November PMI](https://ibb.co/6JzRnJ1) index saw the biggest improvement in over 6 years.

The biggest earnings that will be released today will be from [CrowdStrike](https://ibb.co/RvSk8SJ) and [Okta](https://ibb.co/RDrYy8K), as I expect both of them to turn out a positive EPS, as we might see some momentum in this stocks if they don‚Äôt disappoint.

I greatly expect the [IPO](https://ibb.co/pKzxhmK) of AirBNB, as this could become a company that will benefit a lot from the reopening of the world in the next year or two.

What have I done._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Views on PLTR as a company, not as a meme stock Hi, so i‚Äôve been lurking in r/stocks and wsb for quite some time now, thought i‚Äôd start being a little more active.

I entered PLTR in the 14/15 range and had always intended to DCA up to increase my positions in the company as a result of my DD.

My DD on PLTR looks really positive to me due to the fact that 1) govt contracts are just going to continue increasing (they won a legal battle with the us govt over getting blocked iirc), 2) their commercial software is just taking off, and 3) growth in my opinion is going to be insane considering they only had a mere 125 customers at the time of their last report.

What i did not expect was the crazy surge it had. That said, the volatility don‚Äôt really bother me as much as I own shares and I truly believe in the business. This much correction was pretty much expected, not to mention potential volatility for the upcoming lockup in Feb. 

Was wondering where do you guys see this stock at this time next year?
And when do you think the public will stop thinking of this as a meme and/or a pump and dump?

I have some questions regarding IEP's dividend. Essentially, it seems to be too good to be true. Is there some risk factors I am missing? I put some risks factors below that I thought of, along with a question on margin. Please let me know what your thoughts are. 

 It looks like the dividend is $8 a share, or roughly 16% now. If someone were to have margin with less than 8% interest, why wouldn't it make sense to put it in IEP?  You would need to have some money to pay the interest until the first dividend, but then a portion of the dividend could be set aside for the interest and the rest for taxes/reinvestment.

The stock price could go down, but it was relatively stable through Covid, and in general it appears. It doesn't look like it would drop more than 16% based on its history. It could happen, but based on past history seems like an acceptable risk. If necessary, you could leave the money in long term and outgain a price drop in shares for if you sell.

They could lower the dividend. This seems like the likeliest obstacle to actually earning the 16% annually. It looks like the dividend has been at least $4 per share annually since February 2013, so maybe this isn't as much of a risk? It just seems incredibly high. 

The reason for a high dividend in the first place would be to maintain interest in the stock.  Therefore if they need to create this interest, perhaps they have a reason for it? I don't typically notice high dividend companies, so maybe this is normal for the sector? 

If the stock price decreased and they cut their dividend, both of which could happen simultaneously; that seems to be the worst case scenario, outside of outright company collapse. There wouldn't be a way to recoup the stock price loss through the dividend anymore, and realizing a loss looks likely as I would move on if they weren't going to reinstate the dividend in the future.

# My Thoughts on Kohl's Fundamentals:

Let me preface this by saying I am a millennial, not a boomer, nor Gen Z.

To be frank, if you would have asked me a few years ago about Kohl, I would have told you that their store is crap. Nothing cool there. I'd lump it in the same category as ROSS, Marshalls, etc... Nothing too special. Cheap garbage, etc... But most importantly - not a "cool place" to shop.

**This reflects my personal experience at Kohl's. Yours may differ or vary. I suggest you ask someone who frequents Kohl's, Sephora, or both for more information.**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**However, ever since Amazon started accepting returns at Kohl's - things have been significantly different.**

When you return stuff on Amazon, you could pack your return into a box and drop it off at a drop off location. Or, you could initiate the refund online, then bring it into Kohl's. When you do it this second way, you don't need to package anything. You don't even need the original box. If you bring in your item without the original packaging, they will put it in a bag for you, and they will also give you a various in-store coupons to use, such as a 25% coupon (to try to get you to shop there).

**A lot of people return stuff from Amazon at Kohl's.**

There's always, without exception, a line for returns whenever I go. Fortunately, this line moves pretty quick - but the foot traffic from working with Amazon to accept returns is absolutely immense.

**After I return stuff, yes, I usually do browse around.**

However, obviously Kohl's has a lot of space and a lot of offerings.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**My instinct is telling me that they'll keep reducing their offerings from their "boring part" of the store.**

By "boring part", I'm referring to the kitchen, dinnerware, cookware, appliances, and other non-clothing parts of the store. (Well, at least it's boring to me)

Let's be honest here - to be frank I never shop these aisles, and I usually don't see that many people shopping there.

**So in my opinion, that's excellent real-estate to build a "store-within-a-store" experience.**

It makes it more exciting. It makes Kohl's even more "cooler".

(Note: I know it sounds weird, but by "cool" I mean like target, for instance. A lot of people my age "love target". It's just the experience in there.)

**Yes, Sephora is "cool". Ask any girl you know if they'd rather buy their makeup/skincare/beauty items at Sephora vs Ulta vs Other Stores.**

From my experience, Sephora has the significantly better experience. It's much more inviting, and women who shop at Sephora usually end up spending a lot.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**I've been in Sephora numerous times with my lady. I never buy stuff here, but I've always watched her spend an excessive amount of money. The Sephora experience does get you to buy buy buy.**

I'm a straight male in his late 20's. I have an electrical engineering degree, and I run a few E-Commerce projects. I enjoy advertising, and I'd like to think I'm pretty passionate about business. That's why I go in with her whenever she goes shopping with me. (Just a little context about myself)

Yeah, I love the way Sephora lays out their stores. Besides how friendly the staff are and how "proactive" they are in trying to ask if you need help (because the customer is KING, or in this case QUEEN)... my next favorite part would probably be all the upsells that you see when you're waiting in line.

Their store, their loyalty program, and their experience is pretty damn good, if I may say so myself. It's pretty easy to shop, and their service is pretty good. I've asked my lady, and she says that she feels "Sephora focuses a lot on making sure they maximize the order value of that customer's purchase".

**Hear me out here. What she's trying to tell me is that Sephora does "audit" or "gauge" customers to some degree. Here's what I mean by that:**

* When you walk in the store, they usually ask you, "Are you looking for anything in particular? Or are you just looking around?"
* \^ If you're just "looking around" - everything looks enticing. You can try stuff, look at different brands, and they have all different price points for every customer. (A bit different now due to covid, but you get the point)
* \^ HOWEVER, if you're "looking for something in particular" - that means you're a customer with high intent to purchase. If their floor staff gauges that you're a customer with high purchase intent, you'll probably find yourself getting approached by a knowledgeable & enthusiastic sales person to help you out. **Yes, this is pretty cool. I don't know if they mention this explicitly \~ but this has been the experience of my lady friend when I asked her to really analyze this. That passionate sales person will end up helping you much better, as well as (hopefully) convincing you to spend a bit more and have a better experience so you'll be back.**

&#x200B;

Interesting point. One should note that they're always incentivizing you to buy more. **In other words, they've built their own community of people that are all interested in their products.** You walk in to buy something, then there's another sale a few weeks down the road, then there's another event another few weeks down the road, coupons, discounts, etc. - point being, they know how to make you shop and spend.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

# Okay, let's talk about Sephora's app. I think it's relevant because Sephora does the shopping experience pretty damn well, and Kohl's would more than likely benefit from that in numerous ways.

(Disclaimer: I don't use the app. I've made my lady, who is a Sephora shop-a-holic, give me the rundown - and I've reiterated to her to try to make it as unbiased as possible so that I could get an analytical perspective of it)

* They've created their own version of a "beauty community" on the app.
* Girls would go on there, and post about what they bought. What they recommended, upcoming stuff, etc. They're building conversation around certain products, launches, reviews and experience, and so forth.
* \^ That provides the **confidence in the specific brand in question**. I'd say that leads to upsells.
* Also, because the app is so user friendly, it's pretty easy to end up clicking the buy button.
* Overall, it's a good shopping experience that gets you to spend. Almost like "virtual styling" - in a sense. Yes, if you need help on the app, they will give you someone to help you.

***On this note, Sephora has in-store pickup. I think that's the key right here - because otherwise I'd just say that "why not buy it from Sephora's app instead".***

Well, a lot of girls actually do indeed use in-store pickup. (Well, a little bit less now due to covid, but it's still quite formidable)

**My guess is that this would lead to much more foot traffic. This is a similar situation like how partnerning with amazon simply to accept returns already leads to a significant boost in in-store traffic. Plus, Kohl's incentivizes these customers to shop afterwards via coupon when you make your return. I'd only assume they'd do the same if you went in to the in-store Sephora. Don't forget, they are sharing the operating profit equally.** ([**https://prnt.sc/vtukar**](https://prnt.sc/vtukar))

# Very interesting, indeed. Imho, this is added value for in-store shoppers. It differentiates Kohl's offerings from competitors. It'll boost foot traffic.

In addition \~ hopefully, Kohl's also learns a few things from Sephora in terms of their website experience. Overall, I see this as a huge plus for Kohl's. Sephora is the more modern company \~ it's always changing, always adding new brands, and trying to stay at the forefront of the beauty industry.

In my honest opinion, I think this is a huge win for Kohl's. More foot traffic. More shopping. And most importantly, more LEARNING. My guess is that Kohl's will be able to increase their average order values, customer loyalty, as well as customer experience by working alongside Sephora. In other words, now it becomes Sephora's incentive to help Kohl's accelerate in the years going forward.

Anyways, that's where my head is at so far.

Hopefully later on when I have more time, I can do a more in-depth fundamentals analysis on them.

There are probably a lot of other things I'm missing here, both good and bad - and so I hope that any discussions here could provide more insight.

# What's your experience at Kohl's?

# What do you guys think about this partnership?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Should we be expecting "back to normal stocks" to rally again on FDA Vaccine News? If you go back and look at the charts recovery stocks:(Oil, travel, restaurant, hospitality basically anything shuttered by covid) rallied hard on Vaccine news on Nov 9th.  Still kicking myself for not putting more money into recovery stocks before nov 9th.

Do you speculate we will see another rally once FDA approval is announced?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $WKHS down -22% after hours on rumors of USPS bidding delay to Q2 2021 https://www.trucks.com/2020/12/01/postal-service-delays-mail-truck-replacement-contract-again/

>Already years behind schedule, the U.S. Postal Service announced another delay in its efforts to award a more than $6 billion contract to replace its fleet of aging mail trucks.
The Postal Service told Trucks.com that it expects to reach a contract with one or more of the teams bidding for the business in the federal government‚Äôs second fiscal quarter of 2021. That works out to the first quarter of next year._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ It's that time of year.... TAXES!! What to do about losses? It's time for me to do some actual tax planning instead of just "hoping it works out".   My numbers are small potatoes but hopefully some of you are in the same boat and can also get some useful info.

During the March crash I panic sold (yes, rookie ass mistake) and I have realized losses of \~$10K in my regular taxable brokerage account.  I've been dumping money back into the market and have UN-realized gains of approximately $40K.

Is this where I'm supposed to sell some of my winners to realize a $10K gain, then immediately rebuy for the same price?  Will I essentially not pay taxes?  $10K loss in March, is offset by the $10K gain in December.  So my total for the year is approximately $0.

Am I doing this right?

Edit:  I am in the USA. _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Intro to Investing I'm ready to make my first stock investments and looking for any tips. I've read a few articles that list companies offering investment credits, bonuses, super low cost buy-ins, etc. but not sure if those companies are reputable. I'm looking to invest probably up to $500 at this time just to start to get my toes wet. 

Any companies you recommend? I'd love to be able to use an app on my phone or an easy web interface, and do the managing myself vs having a broker.

Anything I should immediately avoid or definitely make sure I do? 

I know this is a huge topic, but any info helps. Thanks!!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Why did PLUG drop so much? Curious why PLUG dropped almost 10% today. Was this just a rotation out of the ev/clean stocks or is there something sketchy going on?

It's my second largest position and I got really nervous. Looking for opinions from people on this one...

Hopefully it doesn't drop like the chinese ev stocks?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Preferred v. Common Shares It seems to me from experience that Preferred v. Common shares can be whatever the board of directors wants.

For example I could give Preferred shares voting rights and Common shares no voting rights, which is contrary to "common wisdom" which we are all taught when beginning with investing.

Why are we taught that common shares have voting rights and preferred shares have no voting rights but liquidation/dividend preference, if that's only true for some companies?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ What happens to your portfolio during M&A? In reference to Salesforce acquiring Slack, how does it actually pan out? I understand the acquisition is subject to approval but let‚Äôs assume it‚Äôs all approved.
