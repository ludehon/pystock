It was going up and down that day so I thought I sell at $44 again but the system had an error and I could not trade the stock that day anymore. Of course it went downhill from there.   
So I thought I just sit it out because I was quite positive that it will go back up eventually.   
A year later, and it is back up again. So I was checking my account and noticed that even though the current price is higher than my buying price ($40.29 to $40.70), I have a negative of around ‚Ç¨125.

Update: current 'unrealized' gain this week of $1,900 or 3% On Sunday I posted my [game plan for the week](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/jz7n7u/i_draw_with_crayons_so_you_dont_have_to_last_week/) outlining some stocks that were on my watchlist in terms of technicals and entry-points. I updated my plays on Monday morning with my positions.

Due to the short trading week I will be looking to HODL all these positions until next week and maybe close out Monday if we get another pop. I'll still be putting together my game-plan on Sunday for stocks to keep an eye on just incase I close some positions Friday or Monday and free up some capital.

Keep in mind Monday after I entered these positions they all continued to dip. **I was down $600** by mid-day of the Monday trading day, but I wasn't even sweating. I have good entry points and am prepared to HODL shares as always. Yesterday and today was some nice price action for my account as yesterday I regained my losses from Monday and reclaimed the green side and today also gave me a nice jump. Up $1,200 just today on my positions.

These are currently 'unrealized' gains because I haven't sold my positions yet and anything can happen.

**New Position**

**PTON:** Yesterday PTON dipped hardcore down 6%. It was too tempting to resist and sold a put to open when it was down 4%. It continued to dip some more, but I am ok with that. 

I sold the December 11 2020 $101 strike put for $3.6 or $360 in premium. Break-even point is going to be if the stock dips below $97.40, which I dont think it will get that far. If it does I'm completely ok wheeling this stock. It's got strong fundamentals and also a nice IV to collect premium.

**Current Positions**

**PTON:** Mentioned above.

**FB:** Had a nice gain here, will look to close out next week if it continues going up. My strike is pretty safe here and I don't think it will be getting contested.

**KR:** Shares + covered calls. This thing barely moves, but I do expect a very slow grind up.

**LULU:** Going to exit this position next week if I can squeeze out another 10% gain. It's December 18 expiration so it still has a long time to go just for that 30% gain.

**MSFT:** Shares. Slow and steady grind hoping I can get closer to my price target of $220 where it will meet the armed guards of the resistance.

**NVDA:** Shares. Had a good little pop today, I still think this can get up to $550 before I close out my shares and look for new opportunities.

**SHOP:** Shares. SHOP had a great today. Started the week at the bottom of the trend/channel and is starting it's grind up to the upper side. Looking for $1,050 before I consider exiting my shares.

[Positions Screenshot](https://imgur.com/a/4ZlNIfI)_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Simple question: is it possible to predict a stock split? Dear fellow investors,

you can notice from the title of this post that I am not the most experienced investor yet. Therefore I have one simple question : are there any indicators, which could point toward an upcoming stock split? Or are stock splits something, which CEOs just decide to do from time to time?

Why am I asking: TSLA. Their stock is slowly going in the direction of 1000$ per share (again). Last time Elon said he wants to split to stock, so it can become "cheaper" and therefore accessible to more investors.

On the other hand: Amazon. Their 3000$ per share monster should be already split (based on the reasoning of Tesla), but it isn't yet. 

What or who decides to split a stock?

At what point is the stock market going to more accurately reflect the economy?  I'm happy about the gains but is anyone else waiting with bated breath for the coming contraction?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Dividend Capture Strategy This tutorial is the process that I go through using dividend stocks to find and evaluate my swing-trades every month. If you have any idea‚Äôs or questions about the strategy, please comment below. 

Lets say that we have a stock XYZ that pays a dividend on a monthly basis. At certain points during the month we might not know when the next dividend payment will ‚Äúofficially‚Äù be paid out. Most monthly dividend stocks pay their dividend in a pattern each month like on the 2nd Friday of the month or the 10th trading day of the month, etc. The company usually doesn‚Äôt publish this information but if you inspect the historical data then you can see the trend or pattern that they use for their ex-dividend date and record-date. We might be able to estimate when the ex-dividend date and record-date will be but until the company officially announces these dates then it will only be an estimate. The day when the company actually announces these dates is referred to as the dividend declaration date.

After the dividend declaration date occurs we have all the dates that we need for the swing-trade, namely: the ex-dividend date, dividend record-date, and the dividend payable date. If we are not able to estimate these dates before the dividend declaration date then it will not be possible for us to do the analysis needed to setup our dividend swing-trade or dividend reinvestment position. For this reason, I typically only enter positions when the ex-dividend date has been confirmed by the company. 

Now that we have all the dates that we need we can start looking at what each one of these dates means.  If I want to collect the dividend on each share of XYZ that I purchase, then I must make sure that I buy XYZ shares before the ex-dividend date. If I buy a stock one business day before its record date, my trade will only settle the day after the record date. I would therefore not be a shareholder of record for receiving the dividend.

So, in order to make sure that I qualify for the dividend I want to buy the stock at least two business days before the date of record, or one day before the ex-dividend date. 

[Where to buy](https://imgur.com/a/ohm0AgT)

Using the graphic above as an example I would need to buy the stock on Monday the 5th to be eligible to receive the dividend payment. Monday the 5th is two trading-days before the date of record and one trading-day before the ex-dividend date. Now it should become more obvious why I use one trading-day before the ex-dividend date as the sell date for my swing-trades. This is a major part of my strategy as I use the run up into the dividend ex-date to make swings.  

The goal for my swing-trades is not to capture the dividend but rather sell my shares at a premium price to the buyers that are willing to pay a premium during the days leading up to the day before the ex-dividend date so that they will be on the record books and will therefore collect the dividend payment for the stock. You can receive gains many times the amount of the dividend by buying early and then selling the rights to these dividend shares 1 day before the ex-dividend date.

People who are in search of high dividend yield using the dividend capture strategy are willing to pay a premium for their shares in the days just before the ex-dividend date because they don‚Äôt want to miss out on the dividend payment. The fear of missing out is a very motivating force in the minds of men and women alike and it can be seen in the data that I have collected over the last few years.  

So just to recap the overall strategy is to find a dividend stock that typically has a run up into the ex-dividend date.  To do this I look at historical data 2-14 days prior to determine when the run up into earnings typically starts. 


A couple of suggestions:
1.)	Don‚Äôt swing trade stocks that are at or very close to their 52-week high 
2.)	Look for stocks that have been in a down trend since their last ex-div date 

Example: 

To start I narrow my search to stocks that have an ex-date 2-3 weeks out.  This usually brings my window of stocks to research down to about 30-40 stocks.  For this example, I will be looking at stocks with a confirmed Ex-Date between 12/01/2020 and 12/10/2020 this narrows my window down to 18 tickers. 

The stock Tegna (TGNA) looks to have a pretty good setup to me.  TGNA has a quarterly dividend.  At the moment it is about 20% off of its 52-week high..  For this example, I am going to look at the previous 24 dividend Time Periods to determine statistically when Is the best time to buy. 

The below chart shows historically what day has been the best day to buy if I plan on selling the shares 1 day before the ex-dividend date. The chart shows from 2 days out all the way to 14 days out as I have found this Is the sweet spot for the run up into ex-dividend. 

[Historical % returns by day](https://imgur.com/a/Ovuuyh9)

It is clear that for TGNA buying 13 ‚Äì 14 days out is the way to go (remember this is looking at the pasts 24 dividend periods or 6 years).  Though all of the days running up into ex-dividend are positive.  This is a great sign as history is on our side that this is a good stock to dividend swing trade with. Meaning that historically if I consistently bought all days 2 through 14, I would have been profitable.  To take it one step further I look at what would have happened if I bought 14 days out for each of the previous 24 dividend swing plays. 

In the below chart you can see the exact percent gains for each of the last 24 dividend swing trades if I went with the 14 day out strategy.  When taking a closer look, we can see that there have been swings has high as +30% and as low as -10% which is huge.  I prefer to take a safer approach as I am really only going for a small 3-5% gain each month as I have found that works a lot better in the long run.  

[14 Day Returns for each of the pervious 24 dividend periods](https://imgur.com/a/OhWXVxY)


To go with a more conservative approach I look at the previous 24 dividend periods for 6 days out.  What I find is that only 2 / 24 previous swing trades on day 6 would have resulted in a loss and only one of those periods would have been significant.  This is more of my style and likely the play that I will go with. 

[6 Day Returns for each of the pervious 24 dividend periods](https://imgur.com/a/zZG1zZh)

Since the confirmed ex-date for TGNA is 12/10 I will be looking to buy on 12/2 and sell on 12/9.  For this specific example looking at the data I can see that days 2-14 have all be profitable I will likely buy in slowly over the entire period with the majority of shares bought on 12/6.  

I have used this strategy for quite some time and have basically perfected it to the point where on average I am getting returns in the 2-5% region per month.  There are other ways to improve this strategy as well, but I wanted to see if people here were interested in this type of swing trade.   


Important Terminology: 

 Ex-dividend Date: Is the day in which the stock begins trading without the subsequent dividend value.  Investors who purchased the stock before the ex-dividend data are entitled to the next dividend payment while those who purchased the stock in the ex-dividend date, or after, are not. 
confirmed ex-dividend date ‚Äì This is the ex-dividend date that has been officially announced by the company on the dividend declaration date. 

dividend capture strategy ‚Äì A dividend capture strategy is a timing-oriented investment strategy revolving around the purchase and sale of dividend-paying stocks. Dividend capture is specifically the practice of buying a stock just prior to the ex-dividend date in order to capture the dividend, then selling it immediately after the dividend is paid.

Jumia NYSE: JMIA 

I provided a full description if you care to read but, here is the Reddit analysis you care for. Think of Africa for a second. It‚Äôs not a country fyi, it‚Äôs a whole continent of people. A country that is developing so rapidly right now due to the boom of technology at our fingers. A country that every single big tech is trying to get into. Google literally flies wifi on top of Africa to provide wifi to the poorest regions. The people in the richest regions are so rich that they travel the whole world like maniacs. Think of the movie black panther showing the potential in African society. That utopia society is happening now. Africa is growing. So invest in African e-commerce. Invest in a company that is so overlooked. It‚Äôs growing now and it won‚Äôt stop soon. This is gonna be a 2 year hold guaranteed for me. I‚Äôm not taking this out of my portfolio to even avg down. JMIA to the moon baby. 

They got a market cap of 3 BILLION. This isn‚Äôt a small cap. 6 week rally of 400% so far and not slowing down. While everyone investing in China for EV, why aren‚Äôt you investing in the largest booming economy. Do you own DD and check out how much Africa is growing. Buy the rumour before it‚Äôs mainstream. E-commerce is the fastest growing economy and I know all of you already buy from Amazon Wayfair Etsy eBay shopify etc. I hope this brings some light to JMIA and if you aren‚Äôt investing atleast open up to African economy. No rocket emojis.

Upside looks good and small downside._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ From the 30m perspective the price of ZKIN is in a descending triangle pattern and is most likely to retest weekly resistance level, which now acts as support located at $2 per share. I vanna share my ZKIN 30m analysis with you/

On 30m time frame of ZKIN we can see that a descending triangle has formed which has bias to  break to the downside as the bullish momentum is decreasing.

The formation has already managed to see a break to the downside, which dip was bought during the analysis, but it‚Äôs too early to call it bought dip because first of all the trend line resistance of this triangle have to broken in order to cancel this bearish formation.

Break of $2.50 will deny the bearish outlook, while the break below $2.16 (recent low) would bring bearish momentum pushing the price further down to $2.

MACD is performing a next buying wave test, a break of $2.50 can possible result in another buying wave on this time frame.

RSI is in clear uptrend of higher lows.

Price found support at 20 EMA on 15m time frame.

Overall the look is more bearish then bullish and the retest of weekly resistance, which now acts as support located $2 per ZKIN share is expected. 

We consider this move as a healthy correction from the 80% spike, the fact that the price is above $2 is very bullish in short term._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ You should be careful about ‚ÄúRecovery Stocks‚Äù I see a lot of posts about investing in airlines, hotels, and all this stuff. It‚Äôs not a bad idea, to be clear. Obviously as the pandemic winds down people will resume old travel habits for the most part. But just because the industry will recover doesn‚Äôt mean the companies will. A lot of people seem to be taking that for granted.

The US (and most of the world) entered the peak (not the beginning) of the financial crisis in September, 2008. By January, I‚Äôm sure plenty of people had the awesome idea to invest in some recovery picks. 5 months after that, in June 2009, GM filed for bankruptcy protection. That‚Äôs a 9 month lag time. The peak of the COVID outbreak was March and April, so a similar 9 month timeline runs through January. We aren‚Äôt there yet.

Remember 9/11? That was in 2001. Everyone knew air travel would eventually recover. It wasn‚Äôt at all crazy to invest in recovery plays after a year or so. But not everyone recovered, as Delta Airlines filed for bankruptcy 4 years later, in September of 2005.

‚ÄúAre You Ready for the Technological Revolution?‚Äù is an omniscient article that was written in February of 2015. Tech had already taken off and the sectors dominance was inevitable. RadioShack (a tech specialty store) missed the memo, they filed for bankruptcy that exact same month. 

The point of all this, **and the tl;dr**, is that it‚Äôs not as simple as recovery = profits. No matter how amazingly the travel industry rebounds in 2021, it‚Äôs a certainty that there will be casualties and money will be lost. Please, choose carefully.

It doesn‚Äôt take a genius to predict a similar spike in response to papa Joe winning the election. The bulk of this sale spike may not have even materialized since many of the biggest gun buyers still expect Trumpy to stay in power, and also because discretionary spending has been impaired without a second round of stimulus and persistent unemployment. Another round of stimulus checks and a full concession by Trump will spur unprecedented gun sales. The market leaders, Smith & Wesson (SWBI) and Ruger (RGR), are my picks because reasons but it doesn‚Äôt really matter which gun stonk you stonk. 

For the longer term, will Joe have the eggies or political ability, or time, to take on the gun industry? Probably not. He will piss people off whether he takes a strong stance on guns or not, but with Trumpy gearing up for a 2024 run, Joe has more to lose politically by pissing off gun loving conservatives than progressives who will vote for him in 2024 no matter what. 

With cannabis, Joe has a political layup at his disposal. Expect further legalization of marijuana in the very near future. NIC Inc. (EGOV) is my personal favorite but like guns it‚Äôs an industry play so the others should also fare well.

The filing was obviously related to COVID and with other stocks finding their footing again, WLL seems poised to jump for extremely hefty returns, unless someone sees an alternative angle to this which I do not. I‚Äôll explain: 

In January 2020, the stock sold around $500/share. 
In 2018-2019, the stock sold around $1-2k per share. 


Right now, it‚Äôs trading at $20/share. It‚Äôs only up $5 or so from it‚Äôs lowest point initiated by the bankruptcy. I don‚Äôt see legitimate reasons on why this isn‚Äôt going to skyrocket sometime soon. It‚Äôs risen ~50% this month alone while still trending at the named share price. I don‚Äôt see why in a few months to a year it won‚Äôt return to at least $250-400/share. I mean, pure speculation, but why wouldn‚Äôt it?

**NOTE** 
This is NOT a Marijuana company. This is a Hydroponics and supply company that will SUPPLY marijuana companies that are going to be sprouting up throughout the nation as more and more states will inevitably legalize recreational or medicinal use of marijuana and GRWG aims to become the major supplier of all these companies for their tools and equipment to make their products.

I‚Äôm 33 years old, and begin investing during college (more than 10 years ago).  I‚Äôve learned a ton, and built a substantial portfolio over the 13ish years since I began.  I‚Äôve also done a lot of dumb stuff over the years, and learned a lot of expensive lessons. To me, this is the roadmap to begin investing.  



***Step 1) Be sure you‚Äôre financially ready to begin investing.***
In my view, building an investment portfolio is like framing a house.  This is an incredibly important step in your financial security, but needs to be done after you‚Äôve laid the foundation.  I highly recommend Dave Ramsey‚Äôs baby steps (I consider my stock account baby step 4).  Read this and watch his youtube.  Bonus points if you can answer callers questions before Dave does on his radio show.  Another great resource is /r/financialindependence .  your stock portfolio should not be money you need in the next 5 years, preferably 20 years.  Put it in there, and don‚Äôt take it out.


***Step 2) understand your goals the first year (Year 0-1)***
In the first year of investing you have three main goals.

 
‚Ä¢	**Don‚Äôt chicken out.**  Pulling the trigger is the hardest part.  You make your first buy then you open your account 30 times the same day to see how it‚Äôs performing.  You‚Äôre probably doing this not because you‚Äôre afraid of losing money, but you‚Äôre afraid of failure or looking stupid.  You might tell yourself, if I learn to do research I can increase my chances of being right. This is dumb.  The most important thing is to start the trip.  Think to yourself, if you need to travel across the country by road and your options are to take the minivan you have now, or wait 3 days until you can get a sports car. Which is a smarter move?  Get your ass in the minivan.

‚Ä¢	**Don‚Äôt commit a financial blunder.**  For any of you who play any competitive video game with a ladder you know there is a commonality across all of them.  To climb out of the bottom 50% of any ladder, all you have to do is not commit blunders.  You don‚Äôt have to do anything fancy, you don‚Äôt have to be flashy, just don‚Äôt fuck up.  This is 100% true in the stock market as well.  This means you don‚Äôt have to do any financial analysis your first year.  Keep everything as simple as you can to start.  There is still plenty to learn from investing in an ETF the first year, and the third bullet will take enormous amounts of energy.

‚Ä¢	**Learn to manage your emotions.**  The first year is an emotional whirlwind no matter how much you‚Äôre investing.  Your primary goal above everything else is to learn to act calmly.  If you check your account value every day, you‚Äôre training your brain to inject dopamine every time your account goes up.  This is really, really bad.  You‚Äôre going to have a bad day in the market, and your brain doesn‚Äôt get the dopamine hit that It‚Äôs used to. This leads to panic selling and grief.  If you learn this skill early, I‚Äôm 100% convinced your set for life.  The rest is easy.
The other part of this bullet is Reddit is the Instagram of stock market gains.  People only post what they want you to see.  Only the best get upvoted.  This gives us a warped sense of reality, and what our expectations should be in investing.  Don‚Äôt get caught in the hype. Don‚Äôt YOLO.

***Step 3) what do I do after that? (Year 2-5)***
Holy shit, if you make it here, the fun begins. If you can master your emotions you can then begin to nurture this hobby.  Continue regular contributions to your account. Once it‚Äôs in the stock account, don‚Äôt think of it as spending money anymore, it‚Äôs now investment money.  Find elements of the stock market that interest you and learn more about it.  

If I were to give one thing that you should begin learning now and have down cold it would be ‚ÄúWhat changes a stock‚Äôs price and how does that relate to the value of a company?‚Äù

-understand what market capitalization is, an how it relates to a stock price.  What financial tricks can a company play, and how will that affect the stock price, but not the market cap? To me, this is critical to understand.

-be able to know the rough market cap if any major public company you come in contact with on a regular basis. 

-Time value of money.  You don‚Äôt need to know the math, just the concept.  How this relates to opportunity cost. 

-understand how earnings and earnings calls actually affect stock price.  You don‚Äôt need to actually monitor these, but just understand how earnings and earnings expectations relate.

Once you get that down you‚Äôll find other areas of stocks/ finance that interest you. Do you like to do financial analysis? Learn that.  Do you like to think big picture? Invest your time there.

***Become an investor, not a trader.  Investors are ‚Äúgood business collectors‚Äù.***

As you contribute more money into your account, begin picking up individual companies.  Your contributions should be retentively small compared to your overall portfolio.  If it‚Äôs not, then contribute more to your ETF.  For the next 5 years, commit to having no more than ¬Ω of your portfolio in individual companies.  This will mitigate risk, and allow you to learn about individual companies and how to look at them.  My suggested method for finding your first few individual companies are ‚ÄúWhat industries are coming in the 3-5 years, and what companies are the best positioned to be there‚Äù.  Only do that for industries you understand (unless you‚Äôre a doctor don‚Äôt mess with bio-tech).  Some of the meme stocks, are actually great for small individual stock pickups in this stage.  Don‚Äôt invest in penny stocks (or anything with a market cap under $2B) until you know what you‚Äôre doing.  I‚Äôve lost way more money in shit like this than anything.  Also, don‚Äôt fall for value traps (moderate or shitty companies selling for a deep discount).  It might work every once in awhile, but that‚Äôs not our game.

At the end of the day, keep this as simple as possible.  If something doesn't feel right, dont do it.  I hope this gives you the push you need to get started, and help someone out there._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Microsoft said to launch Xbox Series X game console in China next year after getting certified https://www.scmp.com/tech/gear/article/3111323/microsoft-said-launch-xbox-series-x-game-console-china-next-year-after

Microsoft Corp‚Äôs next-generation Xbox Series X is expected to be released in China next year, according to analysts, after a recent decision by mainland regulators to grant the company a certification for an unnamed video game console.

The US tech giant received a China Compulsory Certificate, also known as the 3C mark, from the Certification and Accreditation Administration of the People‚Äôs Republic of China. The 3C mark is the official safety authorisation for products imported, sold or used on the mainland. That followed a separate 3C mark granted to the company for an unnamed console in June this year.

Analysts indicated that these certifications point to the imminent launch of the Xbox Series X, along with its lower-grade variant the Xbox Series S, in the world‚Äôs largest video games market. Sales of the two new game consoles started on November 10 in many markets around the world.

I got in at 10 and 15. Way before the hype started and just after Cathie Wood. I really believe this is a great company with a solid product. However as a developer myself there is things I do see as a problem.

Palantir is an analytic infrastructure to companies, they are invaluable to companies that hold a big amount of data but has no plan or way to actually structure that data. I believe once you start using Palantirs products it's very hard to quit. 

&#x200B;

**The product**

In order for Palantir to sell their product they literally have to get their FDE ([https://www.palantir.com/careers/teams/forward-deployed-software-engineers](https://www.palantir.com/careers/teams/forward-deployed-software-engineers)) onsight. 

A lot of people have no idea what the hell Palantir does. They don't have a massive database where you just can pick out data from and spy on people. What they do is extract the companies data from different sources, structured and unstructured. Clean it and run it through various ML models in order to make sense of it. What they are actually are doing is building these huge interconnected pipelines between all the datapoints, things that had no connection before suddenly do. This is MASSIVE for companies, they can ask the right questions now. The have the answers infront of them, they just have to ask for it.

**The issue**

My whole problem with Palantir is that they are heavily dependent on this process, they can't just sell a product and one the same day have it working. They actually have to process the data for a few weeks before they have a working product, this is basically consulting. It's not scalable, it's customizable. They need units on the ground all the time for new contracts. 

&#x200B;

Now from my understanding it's actually improving, they are quicker and quicker with integrating new customers but I just can't see how they will scale as fast as people think they will. I don't think they can grow at an amazing pace.

&#x200B;

**TL;DR**

I'm currently looking to invest in a certain growing industry, but I'm not sure how to best maximize my profit off of the industry should it explode. I wanted to ask about economics here.

Let me present a scenario. Say Company A is a large corporation worth 100 billion dollars. It specializes in Real Estate. It is looking to get into a new industry in order to diversify its revenue streams. Let's say they want to get in the industry of selling Umbrella Hats. As of right now, the umbrella hat market is relatively small(about 6 Billion dollars in sales per year), but Company A believes that the Umbrella Hat market has the potential to expand exponentially, reaching 70 billion in sales in 10 years. Right now, Company B is a small company with a market cap of 20 million dollars. They made 7 million dollars in revenue last year and have successfully turned a profit. The market would be expanded by Company A, whose innovations in Umbrella Hat technology would cause a boom in demand and increase the public's knowledge of the product.

I am a potential investor looking to enter into the field. Say I want the highest return on my investment possible. I fall somewhere between the spectrum of risk neutral to risk loving, with my stance being closer to risk loving.

Let me first introduce you to the staff and some key players:

Founder - Sir Richard Branson: Founder of the Virgin Group (Virgin Mobile, Virgin Atlantic, etc.)  
CEO - Michael Colglazier: Former President and Managing Director of Disney Parks International  
CTO (Chief Space Officer) - George Whitesides: Former Chief of Staff NASA  
CFO - Jon Campagna: Former Corporate Controller of ICON Aircraft Inc.

Noteworthy Investors:  
Vanguard  
Bank of America  
Morgan Stanley  
ARK  
Boeing  
Chamath Palihapitiya (Also a Virgin Galactic Chairman)  
Cathie Wood (presumably through ARKK)

Partners:  
Boeing ( investor/hopes to be a part of the hypersonic point-to-point travel )  
Rolls Royce ( designing and developing engine propulsion technology for high speed commercial aircraft as well as interior design )  
NASA ( a plethora of tasks including transportation to the ISS, research, and hypersonic point-to-point travel )  
Lockheed Martin ( developer of the Supersonic X-59 plane which will be used for testing hypersonic travel )  
Under Armour (suits)

Timeline of events:

1. Q4 2020 - Q1 2021: A final round of test flights which were supposed to occur during the window of November 19-23. This was delayed due to the New Mexico lockdown. COVID depending this test flight could still possibly happen before the end of 2020, if not very early 2021. This test flight will mark FAA approval and will be carrying a revenue generating payload, being the first revenue to be generated by the company...well...ever.
2. Q1 2021: Sir Richard Branson himself will take a flight up marking the start of commercial operations, the start of publicity and marketing, and the re-launch of ticket sales. So far roughly 600+ tickets have been sold and these will be the first clients to go up. Notable clients include: Leonardo DiCaprio,¬†Tom Hanks,¬†Brad Pitt, Angelina Jolie,¬†Russell Brand, Lady Gaga,¬†Katy Perry,¬†Justin Bieber,¬†and Ashton Kutcher. The interior of SpaceShipTwo has 16 cameras which will be engaged during the duration of the flight and will capture these stars, quite literally in the stars as they float around in microgravity for several minutes. This will be recorded and surely uploaded to their social media. I imagine some of these individuals like Justin Bieber, Katy Perry, and Lady Gaga will attempt to shoot a music video using this footage. Ticket sales will also resume again at this point.
3. 2021: For the rest of 2021 Virgin Galactic will be sending clients to space all the while they will be pushing profits in R&D for future endeavors, such as the hypersonic point-to-point travel which will be discussed later. They will also be building out more Spaceports and ships in order to conduct more flights. According to the last investors meeting, each spaceport is predicted to generate $1B/year.
4. Around 2025: The hypersonic point-to-point ship will be complete and ready for commercial operation. This will revolutionize human travel. To put it into perspective, the International Space Station circles the globe in 90 minutes, and when this plane is complete, so will we. Preliminary indicators suggest that a trip from NYC to Sydney, Australia would take roughly 30 minutes.
5. The possibilities are as limited as space and I won't make your eyes bleed as we talk hypotheticals. I do however want to address highly likely revenue streams we could expect.

Revenue Streams:

1. Space Tourism
2. Hypersonic point-to-point travel
3. Space Force [https://spacenews.com/traditional-launch-services-may-not-suit-the-needs-of-the-future-space-force/](https://spacenews.com/traditional-launch-services-may-not-suit-the-needs-of-the-future-space-force/)
4. NASA Contracts ( astronaut training, payloads, taxi services, etc)
5. Booster Services 
   1. Now, there is no news on this, but this is my prediction and what I would attempt to achieve. As hypersonic travel becomes the standard way for humans to traverse the globe there will need to be a way to make it possible and affordable for the general public. Virgin Galactic cannot achieve this on their own and current airlines (Delta, Southwest, etc.) cannot convert to Spaceship companies either. With Virgin Galactics unique approach and design, they could  become a booster service for airlines. Airlines will need to design a space plane that is capable of hypersonic travel and Virgin Galactic will use their mothership to carry these planes to sub-orbit.
6. While Virgin Galactic is currently operating in the sub-orbital space, I am sure they will begin working on deeper space projects for asteroid mining, moon operations, etc.

Common Objections and Rebuttals:

1. Who would be able to afford this and even if they could, why would they?
   1. There are around 42 million people in the world with a net worth of $5 million where $250k is extremely affordable. The price of the ticket is the same price of chartering a yacht for the weekend. Except instead of playing on a boat for two days, you go to space for a few minutes. Yes, the complete trip lasts around 90 minutes, but we are talking about going to Space. Virtually anyone would say that's something they long to do because that is human nature, if you look at people with high net worth they spend their money on much more ridiculous things. Not only is it human desire to want to go, it has the "Johnson's effect" as well. The Johnson's effect is an old sales analogy, where someone in your neighborhood would say "Oh did you see the Johnson's got a new Porsche?" Inclining you the observer who has the capital to feel the competitive nature and want to also have said clout. So yes, there is very much latent demand on this service. As explained earlier there are already 600+ pre-sold tickets including highly renown individuals and 900+ who have reserved a slot for a future ticket purchase. Note that these ticket sales only stopped because Virgin Galactic stopped them and will resume ticket sales Q1 2021. Virgin Galactic could currently handle 50 flights per year per plane and has recently finished their second plane, meaning they can handle 100 of the 1400 pre-purchased flights over 2021. So, even as Virgin Galactic scales, there is enough customers already to cover operating costs and the development of new planes for several years.
2. Wow so you get to go to space for all of two minutes?
   1. People who say this are people who can't afford it. That might sound harsh, but it is that simple. Very few humans would pass up on this opportunity for such a magical thing if they could actually afford it. 
3. It's not really "space"
   1. Who cares? You get to experience microgravity and float around. You get to see the curvature of the Earth. You get to officially be called an astronaut. The media will not be attempting to point out this very minute, arrogant point. Again, only people who can't afford it will be pointing it out purely out of jealously or disbelief in the Space Age that is upon us.
4. People only invest in this because they can't invest in SpaceX.
   1. Not true. First off, they are completely different markets. SpaceX is orbital, Virgin Galactic is sub-orbital. A SpaceX tour would take you into deeper space for around a week and costs somewhere around $52 million. Secondly, even if SpaceX is a direct competitor I hardly see how that's a bad thing. Competition drives commerce, and to have Elon Musk being your direct competitor, that would only bolster Virgin Galactic. Thirdly, there is potential for partnership between these two companies in the future. A collaboration of completely different and unique technologies to overcome the challenges of the Space Age. Finally, SpaceX news and Elon Musk hype will mean space news and space hype, also helping Virgin Galactic.

What I imagine by 2035:

Spaceports all across the globe, connected by the Virgin Hyperloop (for those who don't know it's another Virgin project that allows humans to travel faster than the speed of sound through tunnels). At this point, Virgin Galactic will already be partnered with other major airlines who have created space planes, very much reducing the cost and barrier to entry. Meaning any human who would have normally have flown "first-class" will now have the ability to end up anywhere on the planet in under an hour. Virgin Galactic will also partner with shipping companies and if you're impressed with 2 day delivery, how does 2-hour delivery sound? Packages moved via space plane, then into a hyper loop to your distribution center, and finally automatically driven to your home via autonomous AI. All the while Virgin Galactic is innovating new technologies for deeper space missions, working with the Space Force, and continuing space tourism.

(About Us from their website): "Impossible Aerospace builds high performance electric aircraft that save lives. Founded in 2016 by former Tesla engineer **Spencer Gore**, the company unveiled its US-1 aircraft in 2018, unique for its long endurance and US origin. The company is backed by Bessemer Venture Partners, Eclipse Venture, and Airbus Ventures."

 Our Mission

"We are committed to serving the needs of government agencies, first responders, private security providers, and those working to keep our critical infrastructure working at full potential.

Our team consists of experts in aviation, engineering, advanced imaging and law enforcement and come from some of the most progressive companies in the US including SpaceX, Tesla, NASA, FLIR Systems and Icon Aircraft."

&#x200B;

CEO and Founder Spencer Gore has an impressive resume:

* Forbes 30 Under 30 
* Tesla Battery Designer
* NASA Astrophysics Directorate
* Space X Falcon 9

He has also surrounded himself with a team of former Tesla, Space X, Boeing, FLIR employees to aid him in his expansion.

I've been reading up on comments from UAV pilots, drone racing officials, first responders etc. and it's apparent the primary issue with drones is the limited battery life.  Only having an average of 20-30 minute battery life eliminates a wide range of efficient uses for this new technology. IA (Impossible Aerospace) has a drone that can fly for 70-75 minutes...DOUBLE or TRIPLE what competitors can do.  Their drones also use FLIR thermal scanning which can be extremely beneficial for..

* fire departments (28,000 in the US): think wildfire prevention as well as assessing buildings at different levels
* police departments (18,000 in the US): assessing potentially dangerous situations before officers ever arrive.
   * It's estimated that a mere 70 of these policing counties can afford to have a helicopter.  The use of drone and thermal imaging could replicate the benefits of a helicopter at a fraction of the price.
* military: obvious applications

They recently completed a $1.5 million dollar deal with the US Army as well.  The CEO of Alpine says he is very confident in this experiment of drone usage to procure future contracts.

There has also been a lot of talk about foreign made drone models/equipment being a threat to national security so a US made drone is of highest priority to the military.  If they see an effective use for these drones we could see them expanded across other branches and used more widely $$$$.

&#x200B;

Funding:

They've secured funding from two notable names in my opinion.

1. Bessemer Venture Partners (known for being early investors in LinkedIn, Pinterest, Shopify, Docusign, Skype etc.)
2. Airbus Ventures (venture arm of Airbus)

&#x200B;

Another interesting thing to look at on another tab at the link above...is the patents.  They have 2 patents pending which appear to really lock down the whole "build from the battery" concept that IA has developed.  If they're able to safeguard this technology it could be huge for future growth.

MOVING FORWARD:

The company is moving in the direction of commercial drone usage as well.  If they're able to retain their competitive edge on flight time and payload, they will be a clear cut choice for the likes of Amazon of other e-commerce platforms to deliver packages from warehouse to doorstep.

I'm having trouble finding the link right now but I've read they recently gained approval to construct buildings and operate in 7 other US states.  I'm not entirely positive what this means but I'm sure the expansion is good.

Eventually Spencer Gore aims to create passenger electric planes which I know is definitely far in the future...but I feel that if anyone can get it done, it's this team.

Would be nice to hear everyone's opinion. Thanks!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Seeking Advice: Managing a WHEEL strategy Hi folks,

I need a little clarity on managing my trades effectively.

Here‚Äôs the situation:

Purchased 100 each of NIO, XPEV, PLTR back in September for around 12.39, 20.00 and 9.52 with a fresh account and a youngling.

While the idea was to hold them and add more I discovered wheel strategy as I progressed in my learning. 

Come October I sold covered calls for NIO, XPEV and PLTR because there was not much movement. 

NIO @25 11/20
XPEV @ 26 11/20
PLTR @ 12 11/20 

Having read that most calls expire worthless and  exercise is not as common, you can imagine that these were pretty deep in the money by NOV 10

I realized that I could buy them back towards the end and had an opportunity when XPEV option to buy back dropped to 6 per share. I guess I was greedy to wait. 

Eventually I got assigned for all them and by the time I collected the amount, the thought of selling CSP  was not really viable. I took it as a lesson and cost of doing business in the market. 

‚Äî-So I am in a similar position now. Sold a call for PLTR and got assigned for 16

-happy with my decision there. 
-sold a call for PLTR 26 11/27 @1.04
-collected the premium thinking the move is not going to be as aggressive.
-by afternoon it almost hit 25
- I brought back the call @ 1.35

So losing money is not the issue. It feels like I shouldn‚Äôt trade if I can‚Äôt manage this strategy with 1 piece of contract. 

How do you guys manage it when your call starts getting in the money. I understand that it‚Äôs ok to allow it to happen and then you may get assigned and that‚Äôs part of the process. 

1. Question is how do you catch the transaction back again once the price keeps moving up. 
Eg. XPEV and NIO just kept going and I held puts in my hand. How long do you keep on? 

2. You also need collateral to pledge if you go for puts going up on the share price. What should one keep in mind once the trade starts getting out of your hands?


Appreciate all your feedback 
Fss_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ It seems beneficial for Biden and the Democrats to correct the markets. The markets correcting seem to be a topic many traders are afraid to discuss, but there are a couple major reasons why this can greatly benefit the Democratic party in the near future, and I believe everyone other than WSB should be understand how and why this can occur.

&#x200B;

* Biden can blame Trump, and never have to worry about  another huge correction during his presidency
* Democrats blame Trump and then have the ability to implement radical progressive changes with little resistance from the now beaten down Republicans
* A market correction will provide a perfect base for extraordinary growth during the Biden presidency, increasing his approval and odds of reelection with minimal intervention.

&#x200B;

When will this correction happen? No clue but I have a prediction... the market crash in Feb/March was easily predicted by COVID concerns, rising volatility during green days, and the quick ATH we achieved beforehand.

We currently meet every single one of those criteria, plus with the thanksgiving COVID wave coming hot 2-3 weeks from now.

I simply want to learn some facts_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Help me think of recovery stocks for 2021 So I‚Äôm starting to build my thesis and ideas to set positions for 2021. It‚Äôs looking like 2021 will be a recovery year and a step into normalcy. What are some stocks that are solid companies with upside to get to where they were pre March 2020? Here‚Äôs my list so far.

LUV and SAVE - I think 2021 will be a recovery for travel but mostly domestic. Both of these companies have cash on hand and can operate closer to capacity with domestic. I like them to recover quicker than other airlines LUV still has about $19 upside to get back to pre covid levels and SAVE about $40ish

BUD - I think clubs, events, parties will slowly step in the direction along with restaurants. People will consumer more alcohol This is still about $32 pre covid upside. 

SIX - Theme parks opening up again. Sea World and Disney already kind of priced in, although I think Disney will continue to grow. Six Flags still have about $30 from pre covid level upside. 

JWN - Although Nordstrom popped today, you still have $15 upside for a solid brand. 

DDS - Same as Nordstrom. Dillards has a good following and $30 upside. I think Nordstrom has a better online presence though. 

AMC - Risky play here as they don‚Äôt have a good balance sheet, but $3 and potentially more upside long term. 

CNK - From my understanding, Cinemark has a better balance sheet than AMC and still has about $13 upside. I‚Äôm thinking of selling AMC and jumping in this. 

Just about all Bank Stocks. All banks are still down good but. The ones I like the most are C, JPM, and BAP.

HEAR should be valued at 3-5x current value if it just follows its peers, which provides incredibly thick margin of safety.
