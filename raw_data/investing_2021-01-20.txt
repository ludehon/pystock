Hello guys ! I’d like to share a stock I’ve had great success with and holds up most of my portfolio because of my confidence in it.

The company name is AgEagle Aerial Systems and they have been around since 2010. They develop unmanned aerial vechiles for commercial purposes such as military, farming and drone deliveries. I heavily believe this company will blow up soon and continue climbing as it has as it’s finally betting the attention it deserves. As long as the company continues moving forward the way it has so far there’s no reason for it to drop. The drone/ai age is the future and worth investing into. 

Do your own DD however for me it’s simply a no brainer looking at the company’s reports so far.

By Gillian Tan and Yaacov Benmeleh  
  
(Bloomberg) -- Payoneer Inc., an online payments specialist, is in talks to go public through a merger with FTAC Olympus Acquisition Corp., a blank-check firm, according to people with knowledge of the matter.  
  
The special purpose acquisition company has begun talks to raise new equity to support a transaction that’s slated to value the combined entity at more than $2.5 billion, said one of the people, who asked to not be identified because the matter isn’t public. As a deal isn’t finalized, it’s possible terms change or talks fall apart.  
  
Representatives for New York-based Payoneer and FTAC declined to comment.
  
Founded in 2005, Payoneer -- which has said it’s profitable -- is backed by investors including Wellington Management Co., TCV, Greylock Partners, Ping An and Viola Ventures. The company, founded in Israel by Yuval Tal and now led by Chief Executive Officer Scott Galit, operates in more than 200 countries and territories. It provides services including cross-border payments for customers including Airbnb Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Google and Walmart Inc. its website shows.  
  
FTAC, led by Chairman Betsy Cohen and Chief Executive Officer Ryan Gilbert, raised roughly $755 million in an August initial public offering for the purpose of acquiring or merging with a technology or financial services technology-focused company.

Let's go straight to the point.

Apple announced in 2020 that they plan to increase the level of privacy of the iOS users, with the release of iOS 14. What does that mean concretely?

\--> As soon as you open a new app, they will ask with a pop up "Do you allow this app to track you across different apps". We expect that 10 to 20% of the users will say yes. Bumble officially said while filing their IPOs that could be a major risk for them, to do proper analytics on their users.

Therefore, all the apps relying on paid acquisition, won't be able to track where you are coming from, and if you are a rentable user. Therefore, it makes it even harder to create profitable user acquisition campaigns on mobile. Those who will suffer from it are casino, midcore, casual games, as well as all the apps relying on paid subscriptions. It will provoke a drop of eCPMS (price per 1000 impressions of ads), as there will be less demand on the ad networks.

Certain networks will suffer more than other, but the biggest one is Facebook.

99% of the revenue of Facebook is coming from ads. It means that they will still be able to do targeting on Facebook itself, but not on the networks of apps that run ads (like all the games). Facebook is a key player in this industry, and this will certainly provoke a drop in terms of revenue (9M businesses are relying on their ad network). They officially said that IDFA change (this iOS privacy update) " Could Have A Material Business Impact".

Apple postponed their measure to Q1 2021, but this will come.

Google usually follow suit with these kind of measures.

TLDR : Significant drop in terms of ad revenue on mobile due to the new iOS privacy change. It will prevent targeting and tracking of the users. Facebook will suffer from it like crazy, as well as other ad players such as Unity, Ironsource (IPO soon) or Applovin (IPO soon), and apps Bumble (IPO soon).

Play : Wait for Q4 Revenue of Facebook. Then short Facebook until next quarter, when the measure will show its impact

I got a lot of feedback from the post. Many people were asking how to “get in” earlier. So here were are. 

After the success of their first SPAC (LAZR), Gores Metropoulos released their second SPAC today. The ticker is GMIIU. If you are not familiar with SPAC’s, the “U” stands for unit. Each unit contains 1 common share and 1/5 of a warrant. In roughly 52 days, you will be able to split your units into shares and warrants. However, you are able to trade units before the split just like any other stock. 

What business will they combine with? I have no clue. They are targeting “consumer products & services” industries. The IPO intends to raise 400 million. So, they have a nice chunk of change to work with. Also, after the wild success of LAZR, they’ve certainly put themselves on the map. I expect another successful merger from this experienced team.

=================

**JANUARY 19, 2021** **•** [**TRACEY LONGO**](https://www.fa-mag.com/author/2369/tracey_longo)

President-elect Joe Biden’s promise to tax the wealthy may include a tax on dividends, something made easier now that Democrats hold the House and the slimmest majority possible in the Senate.

The Biden administration has called for those making more than $1 million to pay the same rate on investment income that they do on their wages. Investment income includes dividends and capital gains.

But an earlier Biden plan for financing health-care initiatives indicates the new president will tax long-term capital gains and qualified dividends at the new top ordinary income tax rate of 39.6% on income above $1 million and eliminate the step-up in basis that allows decedents to pass capital gains to heirs without taxes.

Advertisement

That means the top rate on long-term capital gains would nearly double from 23.8% to 43.4%. Biden’s campaign cites a Joint Committee on Taxation report on tax expenditures which estimates that the special lower rate on capital gains and dividends reduces federal revenue by $127 billion each, according to Scott Eastman, a policy analyst at the Tax Foundation, an independent tax policy nonprofit.

The change would have a significant tax impact on wealthy investors. “We estimate the plan would increase the average tax rate on capital gains from 19.1% to 27.7%, and the marginal tax rate on capital gains from 22.4% to 33.4%,” Eastman said.

While the revenue estimate implies that the government loses a lot of revenue from the lower rate on capital gains, it is “highly unlikely” the federal government could get this much revenue from just raising the rate, Eastman cautioned. 

Research from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) shows that taxpayer capital gains realizations are very sensitive to taxation.

“This is because taxpayers can time when they want to realize their capital gains in order to minimize their tax bills,” Eastman said. “Specifically, the CBO and JCT estimate that the elasticity of realizations to the tax rate is -1.2 in the short run and -0.79 in the long run. Specifically, a 1% increase in the capital gains tax rate would result in a 0.79 to 1.2% drop in capital gains realizations.

“In practice, this means that proposals to significantly raise capital gains tax rates, with no other changes, can lose federal revenue,” he added. “Using CBO data on capital gains realizations and these elasticities, we estimate that raising the top rate to 43.4% could lose about $2 billion each year.”

Eastman said he arrived at that top rate by combining the 39.6% statutory rate plus the 3.8% net investment income tax.

However, Biden is not simply proposing to raise the top rate on capital gains. He also proposes eliminating step-up basis in capital gains. According to the JCT, not taxing gains at death results in an annual loss of about $40 billion.

Again, this is a tax expenditure estimate and not a revenue estimate, and the amount of revenue Biden’s proposal would ultimately raise would depend on how he structures the elimination of the step-up in basis, Eastman said.

Biden “could require heirs to take on the decedent’s basis when they receive an asset, known as carryover basis, but still allow heirs to defer realization of that inherited asset’s capital gain,” Eastman said. “This would raise much less than making death a taxable event—and even then, proposals to tax capital gains at death can have many exemptions.”

It is also important to note how the two proposals interact. “Since Biden is raising the tax rate on capital gains, the value of the tax expenditure for step-up in basis will mechanically increase. This is because the rate at which these gains would otherwise be taxed at would be higher,” Eastman said.

In addition, eliminating step-up in basis at death reduces a taxpayers’ incentive to defer realizing gains. Part of the reason why there is such a strong incentive to defer the tax on capital gains is that if an individual defers long enough, the tax on the asset will eventually be forgiven, Eastman said.

Without step-up in basis, a taxpayer has a greater incentive to realize the gain during their lifetime. As such, eliminating step-up in basis can indirectly boost revenue from capital gains.

While the plan will raise additional federal revenue in a progressive manner, it isn’t costless. Raising taxes on capital gains would reduce the incentive to save by reducing the after-tax return to saving.

“Lower domestic saving leads to lower income for Americans in the future and can lead to lower output by reducing domestic investment,” Eastman said. “In addition, there are administrative, structural and transition issues that Biden needs to consider if he ultimately eliminates step-up in basis,”

While it is premature to make predictions about what Biden and his Democratic-majority Congress will do, Biden has stated plainly that he wants to raise tax revenues by $3.3 trillion over the next decade.

“On a conventional basis, the Biden tax plan by 2030 would lead to about 7.7% less after-tax income for the top 1% of taxpayers and about a 1.9% decline in after-tax income for all taxpayers on average,” according to Tax Foundation analysis.

In addition to the potential new tax rates for those earning $1 million or more, Biden’s plan also seeks to impose a 12.4% Social Security payroll tax on income earned above $400,000, evenly split between employers and employees. This would create a “donut hole” in the current Social Security payroll tax, where wages between $137,700, the current wage cap, and $400,000 are not taxed.

Idk if this a tangent or unrelated to this sub but me and my friends were talking about the idea of a "fintech startup" based off of buying credit card debt directly off of people and then offering them reasonable interest rates based off of some magic machine learning/big data model. I guess something along the lines of Lending Club. We even included blockchain as somewhat of a joke to get more VC funding.

So then I go down the rabbit hole of debt buyers. On Wikipedia ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt\_buyer\_(United\_States)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt_buyer_(United_States))) there's trillions of dollars of credit card debt floating about, yet the debt buying industry is "13.7 billion dollars " (in 2017), which seems small for an entire industry like this.

Even the debt they own is minuscule compared to the total debt that most Americans own. I understand that they make their business mainly through buying the debt from banks of people the banks feel like are a "lost cause" and essentially just want a write off.

Encore Financial Group ([https://www.encorecapital.com/](https://www.encorecapital.com/)) one of the biggest of these entities  and is also publicly traded, yet it's revenues globally are around $1 billion dollars with a similar market cap. It's not like they lose money; they make a profit and, I know this is being based on Robinhood analysts ratings, is a strong buy. They have subsidiaries like Midland Credit Management ([https://www.midlandcredit.com/](https://www.midlandcredit.com/)) which offer services directly to individuals. Their stock is up 89% over the past 5 years, but over the past 3 months it's down 19%. They even have this message of social responsibility that would look great on any pitch deck ([https://www.encorecapital.com/social-responsibility-and-sustainability/](https://www.encorecapital.com/social-responsibility-and-sustainability/)).

Compare this to Stripe, another fintech company. I know they do something completely different (payment processing) , but their revenue is like 4 times that of Encore and is valued at like $35 billion (potentially). I realize it has to do with Stripe's genius idea of an integrated ecosystem and it's like comparing apples to oranges, but why is Stripe more-so of a household name than something like Midland that offers (on paper) an extremely appealing alternative to crippling debt or declaring personal bankruptcy?

I guess my question boils down to: why isn't the debt buying sector "worth" more to investors? Is it because of the lack of growth or potential growth? Thin returns? Big initial costs? Regulations? And is this space ripe for any possible disruption from startups?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Cathie Wood could add this penny stock to ARKX? 
Many are looking for stocks that may be added to the new ARKX Space Exploration ETF so that their stock portfolio returns can literally rocket to the moon. Some obvious picks are Boeing, Lockheed and Virgin Galactic. But one little known and sparcley covered penny stock could be the true beneficiary of the future of space travel. Brainchip (traded under AZKLF in the United States and BRN on the Aussie Exchange) has created a revolutionary neuromorphic chip that excels at ultra low power computation that far exceeds any traditional arm or x86 based processors for certain tasks called Akida. Brainchip has silently sent Akida chips to NASA for an early access program to access the feasibility of their chips as applied to space travel. Cathie Wood seems to think many steps ahead of the competition and Brainchip may be the type of groundbreaking technology that disrupts the entire space industry, the exact type of company she has built her career on, making it a perfect candidate for ARKX.

Here is an article from a local Australian paper (where Brainchip is based):

But wouldn't it be an ideal strategy to buy long calls say with a 2 year expiration on a large ETF, then sell the contract after one year?

For example $10000 worth of SPY calls at a 500 strike expiring 1/20/23 and then sell the contract in January of 2022?

I am not that new to investing, however I think that I am still very amateur. I made all those stupid mistakes such as buying stocks speculations...etc. my question is that how you guys evaluate a stock/company to decide its value? Thanks!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Defense and Aerospace ETF'S - XAR, or your pick? I'm looking to increase my Defense and Aerospace weighting , and am curious on the consensus here. Does anyone have an opinion on XAR; Is there something you prefer instead?

I am currently pretty heavily invested in Raytheon, and have some in Lockheed Martin. I feel good with those positions, so I'm looking to expand via ETF. I have also been in most of the ARK funds for a little over a year, and have every intention of adding ARKX as well once the dust settles. This would be in addition to ARKX, and would look for this to represent about 5% of my overall portfolio. 

Current snapshot opinion on XAR is that it had lower fees and more equal weighting which I like in this situation. For reference ITA is 20% Raytheon and I don't need additional exposure there. 5 star rated with Morningstar, which I'll take with a grain of salt, but other ratings I have access to are also favorable in comparison to its peers. 

Anyone have a strong opinion in this sector?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Do premarket stock prices at 4am reset from previous day's closing price at 4pm or afterhours market closing price at 8pm? First off, I believe stock price is purely a function of supply and demand, so I don't think it's technically correct to say stock price would "begin trading" at any price.

Still the reason why I'm asking this question is that, while I had assumed that premarket stock prices would begin trading roughly at the previous day's afterhours market closing price at 8pm (barring no significant news), I just realized that some investors try to exploit the "inefficiencies" that they believe occur because premarket stock prices would reset to the previous day's closing price at 4pm (even if stock price had changed during afterhours market).

For instance, Lithium Americas (LAC) stock price increased from $20.79 to $24.48 (+17.7%) after hours last Friday following the news that the U.S. regulators approved Lithium Americas' Nevada lithium mine. I've seen some investors trying to purchase the stock below the afterhour price (say $22-23) yesterday at 4am premarket because they believed the stock price would reset to Friday's 4pm closing.

Does this make sense to anyone, and if so, would this be an exploitable strategy? As I mentioned from the beginning, I believe I don't think premarket price resets from anywhere as long as there is no seller willing to sell. But I'm curious because apparently there are some folks trying this strategy..._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Question on CDN’s (Fastly) Wasn’t sure where to ask.

Did a little research, what do you think of these ETFs: XUU, XIC, XEF I am Canadian and am just about to press buy on wealth simple (trade platform). I have no interest in bonds as I am young and interest rates are pretty low. I plan to hold these for the long haul in a tfsa.
I'm thinking XUU because it covers most of US, XIC as it covers most of Canada were there will be no witholding tax. I chose these because they have the lowest MERs and contain many holdings. I plan to do half US, the then a quarter for each Canada & international.

I am a little uncertain about XEF as it is covers international stocks for better diversification, but it's return is generally less and has a MER 3x the other ones (0.22%). Do you think this is needed?

I feel fundamental thing in all this equation system.   
Why when the yields went higher earlier this year metals plummeted? As I understand rising yield is a sign of coming inflation. But why gold which is treated as a store of value lose value at this time? It doesn't have any interest like bonds so I expected prices to go higher.  


Thanks_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Question about call options What exactly is the process to sell you call option when you're in the money and it's before your expiration date?
