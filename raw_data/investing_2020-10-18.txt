Good Return on Whisky Investment? Hi everyone, I was wondering if anyone has any experience with investing in whisky and what kind of returns I should expect to gain? I currently have a barrel of Glen Garioch (57.5 ABV, distilled 2013, cost ¬£2,870.28, 268 QNT\*) and Tullibardine (59.5 ABV, distilled 2015, cost ¬£1,314.04, 266 QNT\*).

So, assuming I'm bullish the S&P 500 long term, say 10+ years, (I am, and I'm guessing we all are, given enough long term...).  What are the reasons to buy VOO over SPXL?   

Sure, in the bear case, SPXL will lose more (and lose it faster) than VOO.  Clearly in the rising case, SPXL will outperform.  In a sideways case, VOO will win probably due to dividends and expenses?

Is their a process for each company, maybe a known process across all companies?

Although once public im sure starlink will be a real winner it is important to realize that its a large market and there are also many limiting factors to spacex/ starlink without getting into to it i would like to introduce and interesting opportunity

Lorl- loral space and communication .on nyse currently trading at 20$ and some change

The meat and potatoes: 

Loral currently owns 64% of canadian satellite producer telesat the remainder is owned by canadas public pension. It is the fourth largest in the world and has been around for 50 years. It has been excellently run by dan goldberg maintaining strong cashflows and important contracts. 
Telesat is currently in the process to create/ have in orbit a leo conetellation for 2022 which is said to cover the globe. So far the tech has been proven strong. 

Telesat will be selling some of its u.s spectrum in december in the public auction and will receive 375$ mil usd which is 1/3 or lorals current market cap. It is also in the process to possibly sell spectum in canada at auction but so far no word on that yet. Its annual revenue has been fairly consistent in the $800-1 bil mark which alone makes loral a value play with a market cap just over 600 mil.

My thesis: 

telesat will be going a different route offering backflow internet to customers with leo( going through existing isp)now some people have voiced criticism at this when comparing to spaceexs direct to consumer. The reality of our world is that many nations will not allow direct to consumer due to censorship as well as the heavily engrained relationships between current providers and government. Which will make backflow the way to go. Telesat is also working with lockheed martin and the pentagon but not much info on that.

Telesat just announced a partnership with nelco india which is huge as india has the second largest internet market in the world and nelco has stong government ties. Telesat also just announced further contract with darpa which could prove to be huge in the comimg years. Telesat also has a large existing revenue base from its ongoing operations. 

The risk: 
Mhr fund is the largest and most influential shareholder of loral. Mhr/ public pension failed to reach a deal to sell telesat for 7bil or 75$/ share in 2015 due to some squabbling. In april of this year loral announced it is in advanced discussions with publc pension to take telesat public but no announcement has been made yet. 

Telesat has already made major partnerships for its leo system so if it fails to secure funding it could be brutal. I for one dont believe these partnerships would have been announced recently if it wasnt a given that funding/ ipo will be announced soon. 

Telesat has the lobbying/ history and tech expertise to be a leader in the space race. Their partnerships in india north america and throughout the world will create a strong customer demand for their constellation. I believe we are on the cusp of some big announcements which will drive share price not to mention the value play already discussed. Hopefully mhr and public pension can work together to launch telesat in the the next huge phase of its companies history._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Does Alpha exist in the investing world, in particularly Equity Investing? I was told Alpha does not exist in the equity markets as it can be explained by risk premiums.

I working in Small Cap investing and believe parts of excess returns can be explained by liquidity and small cap premiums, but not all of it. Lack of information in the small cap space is one of the key drivers to higher returns. Introduction of Mifid2 has meant less coverage on the small cap side and therefore less information which means if you do your dd you can find alpha. 

Maybe there is less alpha in the mid to large cap space? Anyone with views on this?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Square $SQ and debit interchange exemption status? One of the reasons I've been skeptical of $SQ's rise even post-Covid is that investors seem overly excited by Cash App growth, where the majority of revenue is from \*exempt\* debit interchange fees.

Debit interchange fees were regulated under the Durbin Amendment after the Global Financial Crisis (GFC), that put a ceiling on the amount of fees issuers can extract from every debit transaction. The amendment excluded "small" issuers with less than $10B in assets, which was mainly targeted toward small regional banks and credit unions. Thus, "small" issuers that include Square are paid more than double the interchange fees that a mid to large bank get for the same transactions when you use the Cash debit card to pay for things.

Square has been exempt through the growth of Cash App, but if you look at their last 10-Q they are sitting on $7.8B in assets already, and will likely cross $10B in less than a year from now.

For those with a deeper understanding of payments industry:

1. Does anyone know if the $10B asset threshold is for the company as a whole or just customer deposits on Cash app?
2. Has Square mentioned this exemption status and made any projections on which they would lose that status in any report?

Black Swan_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ MoneyGram International MGI Second Most Undervalued Stock I've Ever Seen The first most undervalued is Fannie Mae FNMA but there are a lot of barriers to that investment actually paying off.

With MGI there are not barriers besides the market valuing the stock correctly which I believe will start to happen soon as it finally shows solid profitability again.  One of the reasons the stock is at a low point in the first place is that it lost a substantial amount of money because it had invested heavily in Mortgage-Backed Securities with its capital float in 2008. That legacy issue is mostly gone.  The second reason it became undervalued is that its heavy debt from those losses caused it to borrow money at high-interest rates which caused it to struggle to show consistent profitability.  

Up until about 4 years ago, it didn't have a strong online presence and the market misinterpreted its losses as being attributable to a lack of profitability in its core business.  But if you look at its business you'll see that it has always been a high margin business.  So the company has made significant investments into developing a digital app that is growing 180 percent a year with millions of downloads and transactions that now represent 20 percent of its total revenue.  Even better the company says that digital transactions are even more profitable than agent to agent transactions.  

Its major traditional competitor Western Union has a market cap 24x the 320 million market cap of MGI.  While it's true that Western Union has 540,000 physical locations vs. MoneyGram International's 380,000 in my opinon both companies are way undervalued in comparison to the valuations that newer companies like square are getting in the market.  Square SQ has a market cap of 88 billion, gross profit of 281 million, and a NET LOSS of -11 million.

Western Union had a NET PROFIT of  **$1.058B** in 2019 and because of covid is on pace to have a net profit of about 800 million for 2020 and its market cap is 1/10th that of Square SQ.  

While it's true that CashApp is number #1 in the app store under finance, Western Union is #20, and MGI is number #51.  

What people are missing with MGI and Western Union as far as valuation is that the combination of a digital app with hundreds of thousands of physical real-world cash pick-up points makes both networks much more valuable than one or the other standing alone.  

One of the major burdens on potential senders of remittances is the need to have to physically travel to a location and fill out forms to be able to send money to someone.  Digital eliminates the time hassle of sending money to someone who needs it and it's usually true that the sender of these types of payments is in a better financial position than the receiver of the remittances.  

What I am trying to say is that there are only two companies in the world with the number of physical locations that Western Union and MoneyGram have.  It would take billions of dollars for a competitor to try to build those networks today.  And I predict that when the dust settles these two companies will be able to generate huge sums of money licensing their use to other FinTecs like Square as well as from their own operations.  

At minimum MGI is worth 5x its current market capitalization of 320 million.  I predict that by the end of 2021 it will be on pace to net 150-300 million per year._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Is there a fund that tracks KTEAMP?

SERIOUSLY, what is YOUR opinion for LONG-TERM INVESTING using EToro VS Trading 212: Invest ? Or even Trading 212 ISA... Now, I‚Äôve been practicing with Trading 212 (both investing and trading) for years but didn‚Äôt start investing money because I was underage. 

DISCLAIMER: When I was younger, I thought day trading was ‚Äúthe way to go‚Äù to make a lot of money (for some people it is... for me it really isn‚Äôt). I luckily figured this out before I bought some ‚Äúday trading guru‚Äôs course for ONLY $299‚Äù... fucking bargain btwüëåü§Ø ...not 

I started actually investing in March, and for whatever reason (can‚Äôt remember) I decided to go with EToro...

BE WISE ON WHO YOU CHOOSE !

1. Let‚Äôs start with the NUMBER OF STOCKS.

Trading 212: Invest - 3012 stocks available 
Etoro                           - 2037 stocks available

And the stocks that Etoro doesn‚Äôt have aren‚Äôt just foreign stocks like ones listed on the foreign stock markets like FSE or LSE. They also have US companies ‚Äúmissing‚Äù. This becomes very apparent when you find some ‚Äúgreat‚Äù companies to invest in for the long term and they aren‚Äôt even listed. 

THIS IS ANOTHER THING - they also dictate who you can invest in. For example, I wanted to invest in Spire Healthcare back in March/April, and even though they have it listed, it won‚Äôt allow you buy any shares... STILL TO THIS DAY??? ( if anyone knows why, let me know down below please ) 

2. ETFs

Trading 212: Invest - 446

EToro - 151 - although they do have ones like SPY, VOO and VTI

3. Fees 

Trading 212: Invest - 

Min deposit - EUR 1, USD 1
Deposit fee - none
min withdrawal fee - EUR 1, USD 1
Withdrawal fee - no fees

Commission - commission free, unless you buy UK stocks, then you pay 0.5% stamp duty reserve tax because... the British Government can do what they want ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

EToro - 

Min deposit - USD 200 - first deposit, afterwards USD 50 ( I never even realised this lol )

Deposit fee: none

Min withdrawal amount: USD 30

Withdrawal fee: USD 5 

4. Fractional shares 

‚Ä¢Trading 212: invest - as little as ‚Ç¨1. MOST BUT NOT ALL shares can be bought fractionally as some have a min trade quantity of 1 share. 

‚Ä¢Etoro - min amount to open ANY POSITION is $50, defeats the purpose of fraction shares ???? ü§î

üö®‚Äî‚Äî> Now there are a COUPLE ISSUES with this...

But the main issue is a more PERSONAL ONE. 

I‚Äôm sick of having to think and buy my family things that don‚Äôt want or need for birthdays or Christmas...

So I buy them a share, of a good company that I think is a good investment. Sometimes I DO NOT want to spend a minimum of $50 üòÇ  Call me cheap lol but I‚Äôve got pilot school to pay for... and it‚Äôs EXPENSIVE. 


5. MISCELLANEOUS 

 - Social Trading -

Now Etoro does have CopyTrading. Personally I‚Äôve never used it because I prefer to have an influence over who I invest in, whether it‚Äôs the right choice or not. But for some people, they prefer a more ‚Äúhands-off‚Äù approach, so it is good for them. 

ANOTHER POSITIVE FOR ETORO - on their app for each company you can chat with other users, and people can post their latest thoughts and research on the company. Trading 212 doesn‚Äôt exactly have this but they do have a similar feature which is a forum separate to the app. 

- Layout -

I personally prefer the layout of Trading 212, especially when looking into the graphs, or even trying to find out what your ROI is. It‚Äôs a much more user-friendly interface, in my opinion. 

Etoro doesn‚Äôt offer the ability to transfer open positions to another broker... which is shit. Trading 212 will be implementing the ability to transfer from/to other broker by the end of 2020 (supposedly). 

Also, Etoro‚Äôs customer service is actually really helpful, with their live chat feature. And doesn‚Äôt take too long to connect. 

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî


Just to top it off - 

Trading 212: invest - you can get a free share worth up to ¬£100 

So IN MY OPINION I would 100% go with Trading 212 for INVESTING, and that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm switching

I only invest, I DO NOT day trade, use CFDs, swing trade, trade commodities, trade forex or (currently) invest in cryptos

This is why, imo, I believe Trading 212 is better than Etoro

Looking to subscribe to a stock screener with reliable data on global markets and wanted to get peoples opinions who have used all three of these or at least two of them. I do use another screener but because it uses free data, there can sometimes be significant errors. Important points required and a high level comparison below based on my initial impressions:


- Price  (Screener.co is very good value and much cheaper than the other two. Finbox in the middle and Stockopedia most expensive
-Multiple fundamental value metrics and scores (eg pEG, price to sales, Piotroski) (All 3 are probably fine on this count) 
-  ability to create custom ratios from the UI (screener.co is very customisable in that you can create custom formulas. Not sure about the others) 
- Technical metrics e.g. Sma, relative strength etc (Screener.co only has price change over a defined period) 
- Charts (Screener.co doesn't do this) 
- Excellent graphical UI which saves time by visually highlighting things (with the ability to see on a graph how different metrics for each stock have evolved over the last 5 years e.g. Earnings, ROE, PE ratio, sales etc. and how these stand relative to the stocks own history and ideally vs the market)  - Screener.co much cheaper but can't do this. 
-Famous investor screen (Stockopedia probably best for this and screener.co I think doesn't have this) 
- Comparison between the stocks metrics and that of competitors and general market (again graphically)  - again Screener.co can't do graphics
- Ability to create watch lists that allow easy comparability of hundreds of stocks globally 
- Institutional quality data (all 3 screeners have reuter, s and p data so good)

If half of all public shares redeem for cash, then each remaining share gets 4/9 distributable tontine warrants. The tontine warrants will likely create a fascinating trading dynamic in PSTH common stock._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Investing in less accessible countries Hi, looking to expand outside emerging market stocks. What are some of the best ways to invest into less accessible markets? In this case the new **Pakistan** **Stock Exchange** in particular. It would be great to have a way to easily invest in any country.

I use Interactive Brokers but they don't support all countries._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Why are analysts so influential? Very often we see changes in prices because analysts upgraded XYZ stock to a buy, or because the company beat the predicted earnings (with no further regard to actual growth over year etc). Why is this exactly? Why has the market placed such importance on these analysts? I would like to ignore them, but it's hard to trade without them influencing something. How do you process their opinions and predictions?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Anyone own farmland or timberland that you don't work? From afar? Title kind of says it all.   
There are some regions in which the tax incentives on relatively hands off timberland makes it an attractive investment, if you can hold of on harvest until the market is right. Mostly states in the south, surprisingly, which for me, would mean that I wouldn't want to live near them and actively manage. I don't want to move from the high Rockies, which aren't really good for anything, agriculturally.   
I was wondering if anyone has similar holdings, or maybe commodity farmland? If so, just how hands off is it, best case scenario and worst?  
Seemingly, one of the big risks is a change to taxation and land valuation which would make the land have to pay for itself fairly (Sorry, I know I'm an asshole, but there isnt really a better way to put it). I understand this is the stress of commodity cropland owners every time a new farm bill comes up._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Is Nio extremely overvalued? Hi, I know a lot companies are supposed bubbles but Nio legit sells less than 60k cars a year. How are they almost a 40 billion dollar company?

I'm extremely baffled....they sell like 5k cars a month while Toyota sells almost one million.  Also Nio outsources its manufacturing and doesn't even assemble it's own cars.

Please explain how this isn't Luckin Coffee 2.0.  I fear I'm going to Fomo in to this overvalued company.  Is this really what happens when a bunch or noobies who don't understand market cap and only look at share price join the stock market?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Art Investors - Question For You Thoughts on illustrations by Maurice Sendak? Seems there is next to nothing of his and I, for one, grew up with Where the Wild Things Are. Can't really find anything of his on the market except a handful on the Pawn Stars' website from the collection they bought on one of the shows (and they're asking 25k - 90k).

There is another, smaller illustration coming up on auction and wondering if I should go for it (would be much less expensive than the ones mentioned above. The auction site estimates its value at 7600 - 11600)._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ A Kodak moment?

Trump wants production and manufacturing back in the USA.  Seems like Kodak was pick to play a huge roll in all of this. We just need to hear it from this man
