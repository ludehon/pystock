We used to be the ultimate $TSLA bulls, and now with EV being such a hot topic, our star child here at WSB has been ignored.

Here‚Äôs my full blown retarded thesis on why $TSLA will move this week.

After TSLA split, smart money sold shares because it was clearly overbought. A lot of this money went toward fellow EV contender $NIO who is now 2.2x the price that it was when TSLA made its ATH at end of August. Eventually markets will realize that NIO is overbought, and it will most likely be this week went investors realize how sketchy this company is and how shit their CC calls are.

Smart money will pull back from NIO, and move back to the now *oversold* TSLA for a pop in the short term. IVs are currently low on TSLA so don‚Äôt miss this move.

The PS5 launch seems to be a pretty big hit from everything I've seen. The new diskless PS5 while not as desirable will lock people into buying games directly from Sony. So they should have a margin boost there.   
 

Sony's music platform recently reached a deal with TikTok so Sony is making moves to try and stay relevant with the younger demographic. 

&#x200B;

Sony is rumored to be buying Crunchyroll which is one of the leading anime streaming services. Sony already owns Funimation so it will have a big chunk of anime titles under its belt. Not sure if they plan to combine the two or keep them separate. They already license a lot of Funimation content to Hulu but I wouldn't be surprised if they started to pull content and force users to their services. If they did I would expect a lot of people to switch. Hulu has no original anime that I'm aware of and Netflix original animes have been mostly dumpster fire. Some good ones here and there but most of it is forgettable. Amazon tried to make their own anime streaming service called Anime Strike but shut it down after a year.

If you were burned by the shitron hit piece, PLTR is your chance at saving your marriage, before it's too late like Andrew Left.

&#x200B;

Conventional wisdom says to invest in the person, not the company, so here is some background:

Founder of PLTR, Peter Theil, was portrayed in the hit series Silicon Valley with a blood boy. 

Peter Theil was responsible for hulk Hogan bankrupting Gawker. [https://www.forbes.com/sites/mattdrange/2019/12/23/best-stories-of-the-decade-behind-peter-thiels-plan-to-destroy-gawker/](https://www.forbes.com/sites/mattdrange/2019/12/23/best-stories-of-the-decade-behind-peter-thiels-plan-to-destroy-gawker/)

He cofounded Paypal with Elon. [https://www.businessinsider.com/paypal-mafia-members-careers-elon-musk-peter-thiel-reid-hoffman-2019-11](https://www.businessinsider.com/paypal-mafia-members-careers-elon-musk-peter-thiel-reid-hoffman-2019-11)

And is an openly üåàüåàüåà and proud silicon valley Trump supporter. [https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/16/technology/peter-thiel-donald-j-trump.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/16/technology/peter-thiel-donald-j-trump.html)

&#x200B;

Nothing here is a revelation to anyone. The bull thesis here is that unlike NIO (fuck you Andrew), PLTR is Citron proof.

Gawker has shown that no one can talk shit about PLTR because they will literally be sued into bankruptcy. Only positive news from here on out.

Theil will litigate Citron out of existence.

In addition to his litigious tendencies, the actual product of PLTR is mass surveillance. At any moment, Theil knows the real identity of every anon, myself included. All hail overlord Theil!

***Volatility Expectation =*** I expect the market to move less than 5% +/- over the next two weeks. Vix expectation is 1.13% to 1.57% (18 to 25) +/- and VVIX to move 7 to 10 points +/- or between 115 to 125

**Full Summary & Rational For Trade** Realized and Implied volatility will continue to trend lower over the next few weeks. This will provide traders structural opportunities to profit from selling elevated convexity into the market via Put Write/ Call Write Strangles, which are 5% out of the money. Traders will assume the role of Insurance Companies for two weeks selling premiums via writing policies and keeping the profit at the end of the two weeks. Profit from it

**Brief on Trading Suggestion**; We will temporarily be in a period of reduced swings up and down (lower realized & implied volatility)

**The rationale for the Trade;** The market will remain relatively range-bound over the next few weeks. This will present traders with the perfect opportunity to profit from selling volatility back into the market. A low return environment and possible negative curve (with Federal Reserve Balance Sheet Expansion acting as a useful backstop) invite investors to re-engage temporarily in seeking to exploit timely carry trades by selling volatility back into the market.

**The Risk for the Trade**; The risk is any large increase in realized volatility, which causes the equity market to move up or down greater than 5% to 7% this week. This would create substantial problems to the right or left side of the distribution curve. What we would like to happen is the movement of >4% and <(-4)% for the full week.

 If you look at 4h hour chart for SPY, SPY is clearly on an uptrend. The 9 ema is showing a strong uptrend, due to vaccine news, as well as the election results. However, in my opinion that is probably wrong, SPY is going through a buy the rumor sell the news period with these vaccines. If you look at the ATH candle when PFizer released their vaccine results, there is a strong pullback from these ATH. This strong pull back could be due to SPY being overbought, but if you look at the OBV indicator you can see how SPY's bullish volume has been decreasing even at new ATH. Now this volume is definitley a warning sign but we can't just take a trade based on that, we could use some further confirmation. 

We can also see on the MACD indicator that momentum has met resistance at around the \~5 level. Furthermore, as SPY is making new ATH the MACD is meeting the same resistance of the old ATH, showing a divergence b/w momentum and price. 

On a more fundamental level, the vaccines are nothing more than good news for a day. The reality of us having these vaccines used withing 6 months is very dim. Also, lockdowns and cases in the US are dramitaclly increasing. Michigan just announced a closure of stores and schools, and New York is planning on closing schools. Come Thanksgiving time, I predict we will see a massive amount of new restrictions imposed by states. I think that once these vaccines wash away and are digested, any significant bad news will be met with significant bearish volume and we can definitely see a return to the \~320 support if there is bearish momentum.

Even better still, many businesses have saved a ton of money using their software. I'm really sure this is going to be big in the next few years and its share price will definitely increase by quite a few times IMO. Its most recent financial results doesn't seem great (but that's only if you look at their EPS, they actually paid a shit ton of stock expenses to get listed as well as to pay their staff), but revenue wise it nearly doubled and they are getting a lot more clients.

NET - I'm sure most have heard of this one, the cloud industry is still in infancy but it'll be big in the future. Even if you are looking to hold for the short term, this is still a good hold, I strongly suspect they'll be profitable next quarter, on the back of their strong performances in the past few quarters (hence the jump recently), but I'm pretty sure their impending profitability isn't fully priced in yet.

CBAT - A Chinese firm making batteries for electrical cars. They have a huge amount of potential, news came out that they are producing more efficient batteries than Tesla (you can look it up), and they should start mass producing it next year. I know that their stock prices have gone up a lot recently, but I believe there's a lot more room to run, with such advances, there's no way this company is only going to be worth a few hundred million. We are talking billions, with the amount of electrical cars to be produced in the future. This stock could still increase by up to 10x. 

For transparency sake, I have shares in all three. (Sorry I'm no autist so I don't play options, hold long for the win!)

Some of you have been making tons of money by inserting that big green dildo called NIO over the past few weeks (or months). However, many of you are just pathetic losers that called ‚ÄòNIO overvalued‚Äô at a $25 pricetag and full on missed the rocket that has been heading to the moon. 

What do these losers do now you might wonder? In a pathetic attempt to compensate for their lack of grown man balls that initially would have resulted in big time $$$, they make bets on shitty Chinese EV car manufactures in the hope they are the new  (undiscovered) NIO. Let me spare you the long DD story, but this will not lead to the 10 baggers you are hoping for and you are going to get burned sooner or later. But if that won‚Äôt make me rich, what will make me go to tendie town like the WSB gods have promised me? Well, good for you that you are still reading at this point, because here comes the money.

The company that will make us rich is called NIU (yes I am not kidding, Nio with an U). They make EV mopeds (scooters) and have been dominating the Chinese market since the day they started. This company is now succesfully expanding to Europe and parts of the USA. Their fundamentals are extremely good and they are beating earnings for breakfast. And guess what, the market cap of this company is only 2.5B. Meaning the room for growth is enormous, knowing that the whole of Asia is driving mopeds as a main form of mobility and they are all looking for good EV alternatives. Good thing is, there is only one proper EV moped company on the market right now which is NIU. Bonus, they are also coming up with their first electric motor, meaning the room for growth is even bigger. 23rd of November is earnings, and they are going to absolutely demolish expectations, mark my words.

I‚Äôm having all my life savings in NIU, feel free to do the same.

What am I missing_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Boqii DD (China's Chewy) Boqii (BQ) IPO'd earlier this year, and I've been watching it quite closely since then. Essentially they are a Chinese pet food and service company who are backed by both Goldman Sachs and Alibaba. Unfortunately, they IPO'd on the same day as Palantir and Asana and was drowned out by them.

&#x200B;

Boqii is valued at nearly 1 billion dollars and has almost 23 million users which is pretty astounding but now let's get to the juicy stuff.

&#x200B;

Boqii reported incredible earnings this morning which you can read here:

[https://www.wfmz.com/news/pr\_newswire/pr\_newswire\_business/boqii-announces-fiscal-2021-second-quarter-unaudited-financial-results/article\_d4b6deed-f829-55c2-977f-36f9855f668b.html](https://www.wfmz.com/news/pr_newswire/pr_newswire_business/boqii-announces-fiscal-2021-second-quarter-unaudited-financial-results/article_d4b6deed-f829-55c2-977f-36f9855f668b.html)

&#x200B;

Or you can read my summary:

Total Revenue of 33.8M USD which is up 35% from this time last year

Had 1.3M unique buyers which is up 15% from this time last year

They released a new video web service

They purchased a stake in a veterinary program called PetDog which expands their reach into pet services

&#x200B;

My point being this company has good backers, a growing user base, and strong financial futures. I'm extremely bullish on this company especially with a price of 5.20 a share and an analyst fair price of 10-12 a share. This company just needs a push in the right direction to take off, and I think that could happen really soon, especially since American investors are becoming more accepting of investing in Chinese companies.

I figured I would start with the letter P since it contains the stock that made me millions. Please comment your favorite P stocks. 

PLTR- a great Covid play- growing revenue 50% YOY, led by Peter Thiel and a mad scientist with ties to both administrations. VERY MOATY business with contracts in defense as well as contracts around Covid tracking and tracing. Lots of hype, Cathy from Ark recently bought. They did a direct listing which kinda flopped. Big players taking positions.

PRTS- A great play in general as well as covid- these guys compete with O'reilly, Autozone, etc. they grew 60% this past quarter and they are purely an online play. Recently opened a second distribution center and have price targets in the high teens and up to 20. These guys have their own in house brands and ship DTC.

PRPL- if you don't know about purple then you haven't been reading my posts. It's had a pull back in the last week and it has a consensus target around 35.00. 40% upside. This company is also growing revenue 50-60% YOY and are capacity constrained. Still my favorite stock.

PSTH- this is a SPAC play without a target. Max downside is \~3.50 per share right now as it is a trust that can be redeemed for around 20.00 a share if you decide to exit. it is popping because big dick Seth Klarman invested 400M, Wells Fargo 220M and Guggenheim 500M. This is speculative and we hope it's stripe but it could end up being a dud.  I will be posting some conspiracy theories (DD) on it tonight as my good buddy u/infamousbreadfruit99 is balls deep into analyzing them and I believe he is right. 

This is not investing advice- I am a gambling degenerate.

I have ACB calls to strike $12 and it immediately tanked_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Why cruise lines might dump in the near future Cruise lines might dump before January, here‚Äôs why.

‚ÄúSo far a total of seven passengers have tested positive for Covid-19 aboard the SeaDream 1 cruise ship docked in Barbados, according to two passengers on the ship.‚Äù This was the first major cruise to try sailing with these new CDC guidelines and covid is being spread on the ship, as expected.

‚ÄúA pair of Democratic Senators have sent a letter to the Centers for Disease Control, appealing to the agency to reinstate its ‚Äòno sail order‚Äô that would prohibit cruises from sailing in U.S. waters during a current surge in COVID-19.‚Äù
There are already senators trying to make CDC reinstate the no sail order due to covid spikes.

Most major cruise lines plan on sailing in 2021 and are using this time to prepare their plan to follow CDC guidelines. But if the CDC determines they will reinstate the no sale order it will have to be before January to prevent cruise lines from sailing. There is also the political factor, that CDC might‚Äôve lifted the ban under pressure from POTUS, but in January we‚Äôre getting a new one and he is the same party of the democratic senators applying pressure on the CDC to cancel cruising.

I think there‚Äôs a 50/50 chance this happens. And you retards love those odds. I have no relevant positions currently but wanted to give you guys a heads up because no one is talking about this and cruise lines are soaring on vaccine news

TLDR: CDC might reinstate no sail order before January. Cruise lines will tank if that happens. Buy cruise line puts expiring January if you wanna make a speculative bet.

Before you jump to conclusions, I don‚Äôt draw lines just to draw them. Each line has a meaning and I only utilize them as we get near them so don‚Äôt spazz when you see all them lines. I do gap ups/down, resistance/support for 1-2+ weeks AND dark pool prints (bonus). Lot of this has to do with entry and exits. 

355.60, 356.60, 357.70, 358.10, 358.75*, 360.37, 361.53, 361.92, 362.20, 362.79, 364.38, 365.65+ (pre-market ATH on 11/9).

Got some dark pool activity at 358.10 area this morning. Continuing from my last forecast, we are past our previous ATH (358.75) therefore looking for that area to be support instead of resistance. 

Somewhat short and simple. 

Bullish üöÄ scenario: Look for 360.37 to be support. Currently need 360.67-361.59 to hold until we push higher. Next channel with high volume push is 362.79-363.88. Will need 363.88 to be support for us to head past ATH channel 364.36-365.65+


Bearish ü©∏: Need 360.37 to break and act as resistance instead of support. Unload some puts around 360.37 area and be on standby to see if there is a bounce back. Next gap down is to previous ATH area 358.75-358.10 unload most puts here. If 358.75 is back to being resistance, look for us to continue to drill down towards 357.50-355.60 (the bottom). For any reason 355.60 breaks, all hell is loose. 

Kang gang between: 358.10-360.37-363.88-365.65+

Because the market was trending upward, I originally only sold the "18" delta put 15 minutes from close and neglected to sell the calls, but in the last 2 minutes I said fuck it, lets get another $11 out of this trade and sold the call at the strike above where SPY was sitting for .11. The call closed OTM since SPY was 256.67 or so, but due to a post market upward trend post-market I got exercised anyway. I panicked for a second but by the time I got the notice for exercise 8 hours later, SPY futures were down about .5%. I waited till AM hours (4AM) and  closed my assigned shares, which I was short @ the strike price of $357 as a result of assignment, and made $227 total from the call premium + SPY. Not something I am going to do again but what a nice profit for an autistic 0 DTE theoretical $11 gain trade.

A lot of you are probably too retarded to understand this but for the autists out there with a few brain cells left, hear me out. I'm late to the game with NIO and I wanted to hop on the bandwagon but premiums are through the fucking roof and I really don't want to get cucked by IV crush post-earnings. So, I've been trying to think of a play that neutralizes vega but still gives me upside... and here it is. I don't know the technical term for what this is but it's essentially a 2-sided ratio spread. 

[-2 DEC35P, +1 DEC38P, +1DEC60C, -2 DEC70C](https://preview.redd.it/6grzeouidjz51.png?width=1868&format=png&auto=webp&s=dfef41a226e84494271c5fc8219bbdd0c9c5f3ea)

As you can see from the chart, there's a huge spread on BEPs and you still have a really decent credit ($320 per contract) if NIO doesn't blast off this month. NIO launches +50%? Awesome, you're making $1000 per contract now. NIO sells off? You still profit all the way down to $29 - and if it drops below $29 what do you do? Take delivery! You now own 100 shares for a 37% discount!

The question is, what if NIO doubles this month? Well you still break even. BEP is around $83. If you are a super bull and think >100% is going to happen before Christmas.. well just buy lottos. But even if you want to go that route you can add the put ratio spread to your play (The left side of the chart) and pocket the premium!

This play can be used by the bulls and even you gay bears. Literally can't go tits up.

Play for regular autists: -2 DEC35P, +1 DEC38P, +1DEC60C, -2 DEC70C

Play for bears:  +1DEC60C, -2 DEC70C

Play for perma-bulls: -2 DEC35P, +1 DEC38P, +1 DEC100C_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ What do ya'll think of ORCL? It was recently just in the news about the US filing a 15 day extension for ORCL, WAL, and other investors to buy it. ORCL has the obvious mastery in the nuts and bolts of Tik Tok, which is data management and cloud work. Read this excerpt.

*  In Tuesday‚Äôs court filing, ByteDance said it submitted a fourth proposal last Friday that contemplated addressing U.S. concerns ‚Äúby creating a new entity, wholly owned by Oracle, Walmart and existing U.S. investors in ByteDance, that would be responsible for handling TikTok‚Äôs U.S. user data and content moderation.‚Äù 

Since the new entity would mean that the US gets to own the user data (remember that the whole point of the trade war is that China was quote on quote stealing US data, lol). This would increase Oracle's value immensely, as it is a business deal closely related to working with the governments (smells kind of political) and to be able to wield TikTok in the American market would be comparable to the new snapchat or instagram or vine. It seems like a really great app (100 million users), and once hands transfer over to an American company (fingers crossed?) the tech market would probably be disrupted to some degree as well, as it's comparable to Facebook buying Instagram, which many people are pissed at for mishandling American's data....

Oh, plus the Don gave it, "his blessing."

I don't do calls or anything, but I might put a good chunk of change into it soon.
