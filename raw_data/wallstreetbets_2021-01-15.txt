 Google Trends Analysis of Amzn searches. For those playing upcoming earnings. &#x200B;

I've compiled google trends comparing Amazon searches over the last 3 years. Then, I correlated that information with Earning Reports. Keep in mind this doesn't take into account people using the app store. 

TL;DR. I've deduced that Q2's huge boost from earnings could have been easily been spotted using Google Trends. Also, I've found the overall interest in searches during Q4 this year is better than 2019 Q4 Google trends, in which the underlying had an 8% pop from Q4 ER. Keep in mind Consensus Estimate is almost double that of 2019 Q4 ER. 

&#x200B;

To help you make sense of the Google Trends graphs I've posted, I'm also including a chart that fellow Amazontard u/slocs1 used in his EPS post. 

&#x200B;

TABLE 1

https://preview.redd.it/9i90ampipkb61.png?width=1472&format=png&auto=webp&s=6fa531224626dabfcf0a80ff6606aedc695099b8

TABLE 2 shows trending results for Q2 Amazon google trends. The last big ride for Amazon was for q2 (april-june 2020). Google trends justified Q2's pop as average google interest was well over 80 and mostly in the 90s.

&#x200B;

TABLE 2 

[2020 Q2 amazon google trends ](https://preview.redd.it/r2s8ec4vekb61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=59380e74bc0f0bca95f145e015aceb575317dc83)

&#x200B;

Q4 2019 ER had an 8% pop day of earnings release. Mostly in 50s and 60s interest, plus holiday pop, then averaged out at 75 interest. Trends showed in TABLE 3:

TABLE 3

[2019 Q4 amazon google trends ](https://preview.redd.it/ywz1etq9fkb61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=e0805354ecd48509438c5ff78d272c0a20e6760b)

2020 Q4  shows very similar interest patterns to previous years. The dip in interest is from the election, not sure what that mid October pop in interest was. The general interest is higher than 2019.

&#x200B;

TABLE 4

[2020 Q4 amazon google trends](https://preview.redd.it/bv6kuc6hjkb61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=23f61372729937b710a393e282430613d2627ed7)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

TABLE 5 shows entire 2019-2020 google trends. Again that Q2 growth in interest (may) directly correlates to stock's growth during Q2 Earnings Release. The holiday season interest was stretched out this year, and shows it was 10 days longer than 2019 Q4, which is promising. 

&#x200B;

TABLE 5

[2019-2020 Amazon google trends](https://preview.redd.it/3b56dq10kkb61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=efc1925f3c7310f3b63dc859814e17b287312235)

And here is 5 year google trends. Clearly, massive growth in Q2 this year, but radically declined to the yearly mean for Q3, which is possibly why Q3 ER dropped the underlying stock price, as interest stagnated, although it was still above the previous years interest. 

&#x200B;

TABLE 6

[5 Year Amazon google trends](https://preview.redd.it/r5hjpvq4nkb61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=623a3375c36d2baec87a5f66b71679134a49d42d)

&#x200B;

Although Google Trends isn't taking into account all of the industries AMZN is dipping it's pen into (i.e. AWS). I do think it's compelling all the same. I will say that I wish I saw more of a drastic change in Q4 google trends to be more confident my calls will print. Please, give me feedback and advice as my calls are bleeding rocket fuel :)

Positions: 02/19 3300c_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $SRNE to the moon (again) 🚀 First-time poster here, but I've been lurking since about September. Y'all brought me tendies in the form of GME and PLTR plays in the past couple months, so I thought it was my turn to repay the favor with some DD on a company that I haven't seen posted about on here yet. This isn’t a short-squeeze opportunity or an ARK darling that’s up 100% in the past year. The play here is Sorrento Therapeutics ($SRNE). SRNE is a biotech company which specializes in researching the use of stem-cells for cancer treatments, as well as non-opiod pain relief treatments. However, if you recognize the name, its more likely due to their developing pipeline of COVID-19 offerings. Since the outbreak began in March, SRNE has applied their resources and existing competencies to developing treatments and testing kits to combat the pandemic. In addition to their ongoing cancer and pain relief projects, they have 11 potential COVID-19 related products in various stages of the pipeline. You can view everything that they are working on here:

[https://sorrentotherapeutics.com/research/pipeline/](https://sorrentotherapeutics.com/research/pipeline/)

Essentially, this company is working on projects to combat cancer, the opioid epidemic, and, oh yeah the global pandemic that has dominated the planet for almost a year now. There is massive demand in all of these areas for new solutions, and Sorrento could be one of the organizations that solves part of the problem. 

Needless to say, SRNE has a lot going on in its labs at the moment. However, each one of these projects represents a potential catalyst for the stock price. For example, the stock jumped almost 200% on May 15th when the company announced that one of their antibody treatments was 100% effective in inhibiting the virus in early testing. (I was holding 450 shares @ 3.15 that I had purchased purely out of excitement for their cancer and pain relief work. I was more than happy to dump them at $10.2 during pre-market on May 18th 😌)

[https://investors.sorrentotherapeutics.com/news-releases/news-release-details/sti-1499-potent-anti-sars-cov-2-antibody-demonstrates-ability](https://investors.sorrentotherapeutics.com/news-releases/news-release-details/sti-1499-potent-anti-sars-cov-2-antibody-demonstrates-ability)

Then in August, the share price climbed to a peak of $20, apparently on pure speculation. These two examples demonstrate that this stock has a ton of interest in any news or releases on the COVID front, which arguably isn’t even its main business. The share price has been volatile since August, moving within the $5-12 range over the past 5 months.

**The reason I am writing this post now** is because the stock is up about 20% today, again with no news as of this posting. On December 22nd, the company filed an application for an Emergency Use Authorization for their rapid-test product with the FDA. This is where I think the real money is there to be made. They missed the boat on the vaccine race, but there is still a huge need for improved testing, which in the past has been inefficient and inaccurate. SRNE’s COVI-STIX can reportedly deliver results in 2-15 minutes. With widespread availability of this testing, we could even get back to sporting events and concerts, as testing could be done quickly at the gates of the arena, and any positive cases would be turned away and refunded. SRNE is also working on a rapid spit-test, which would eliminate the need to have a q-tip rammed into your brain.

News on the potential approval of COVI-STIX is imminent, which could further send the stock price higher in the short-term. 20% would only be the first step on this moon mission, as no real news has even been released yet. It's also possible that the jump we saw today could be pure speculation and the price will fall back into the $7-8 range next week and stay there until actual news is released. I'm not saying buy or don't buy right now, but I wanted to get this DD out here before the stock really moons. Just wanted to give everyone a chance to read into this company over the long weekend.

Regardless of this short-term spike, the play here is the sheer number of possible catalysts in their pipeline at the moment. The stock currently trades at a $2.6B market cap, which leaves room for a huge move upwards. The company has increased their cash while lowering debt in the last year, meaning they should be in no danger of going under in the near term. They generated $28M in revenue in the first 9 months of 2020 from their one existing product, and this revenue could double if they get any of their new products approved.

SRNE closed at $9.50 today, but the **average 1-yr estimate on this company is $25**, which in my view is completely attainable if any of their products attain FDA approval and make it to the market.

If you're looking for any other reasons to get on the SRNE train, the company has a CEO in Dr. Henry Ji who publicly hates shorts as much as we all do.

*"I am giving them a fair warning shot. Just cover yourself, don't ruin your family," Ji said of short sellers who he says are trying to manipulate Sorrento's stock.*

[https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/08/26/sorrento-therapeutics-opened-up-117-after-ceo-slam/](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/08/26/sorrento-therapeutics-opened-up-117-after-ceo-slam/)

(Seriously, with the amount of hype around this stock, it takes almost nothing to move it double-digit percentage points)

Even after this declaration back in August, there are still 68M shares sold short as of 12/31/20. It's not GME level short interest, but it would accelerate the rockets if any big approval news is released.

[https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/srne/short-interest](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/srne/short-interest)

I'm not as experienced with options trading as most of you are, but if you want to buy calls I would buy them at least a few months out. The news that could send this stock up 100% is likely imminent, but it will be impossible to predict its timing since we are dealing with FDA approval here. It could be next week, it could be in March. My guess is as good as yours. I wouldn't buy any weeklies or FD's and expect to hit it big. If you like what you read here, take some of your GME profits and buy a few shares and hold on till this baby hits $20+

As always, do your own research into the stock before throwing your money at it.

**Positions:** Too dumb for options so I'm holding 500 boomer shares at $7.21.

**TLDR:** Biotech company with over a dozen potential COVID/Cancer/Pain Relief products in various stages of FDA approval process. Potential EUA approval for rapid COVID testing product sometime in the next month = 🚀. CEO hates shorts. Buy shares or longer-term options to ensure that you are holding when any news hits.

Obligatory 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 for good luck_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Only been here for a day BUT THAT’S ALL I NEED 🚀GME GANG🚀 _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Gamestop Friday Notes - Short Sellers will loose 🚀🚀🚀 &#x200B;

Today has been an incredible day for us despite the 11% share price drop. I want to use this opportunity to thank everyone for holding their line. Many of us, including myself, have bought more shares today and will continue to do so until we see the actual squeeze happening.

  

### 📅 This has happened today:

* An annoucement was made that GME board members who are resigning have sold their shares causing today's price drop as a reaction by the market to these news (NEGATIVE but the market came together and held the line to minimize impact)
* Fidelity and Schwab are confirmed to have eliminated margin on $GME (NEUTRAL)
* There is current talk about margin calls going out soon (POSITIVE)
* Uptick rule (SEC 210) is in effect until at least EOD Tuesday (POSITIVE)  


### 🔮 This will happen soon:

* Short sellers will be margin called soon - there is no way around this now
* **We will have another large squeeze**
* GameStop will undergo a huge transformation and capitalize on the ever-growing esports / video game market

&#x200B;

### 🐻 Melvin and other short sellers

You targeted the wrong firm! You were gambling on 45,000+ people (FT & PT) to loose their jobs as GameStop would slowly go out of business. 

But guess what: after Ryan Cohen bought further into GME this will never happen. The team at RC Ventures will make sure of that. And us, we will hold the line and buy further into it until we get rid of all large short positions. GME is not a dead company, it is just getting started.

**GameStop is here to stay and will undergo an amazing transformation!**

&#x200B;

Note: For everyone who is new to this, please be aware that options have very low impact on share prices and that volatility (among many other things) plays a huge factor in your trades. Be careful with your trades and always do your own due diligence.

PS:  🚀🚀🚀🚀

Positions: 190 shares, 5 1/22 $38c (full reinvestment of my old calls)

TL;DR: Today was a rough day but an amazing setup for the coming week. $GME will go to the moon.

Edit: explained some confusing bullet points_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ SEC filings today showed that GME insiders are selling stock. The absence of a filing from any Cohen/related may be more telling of what the future has to hold than the sales we know about I'll keep it short

* Board members that are likely on their way out are selling shares
* An additional board member's (Kurt Wolf's)  fund sold a bunch of shares the other day to align with their concentration guidelines for individual stock positions. Essentially the price went up too much and the position got too big as a percent of total assets so they sold some.
* Per the recent agreement Ryan Cohen signed with the company he is not allowed to own more than a 19.9% steak. As of the most recent filing he only owns 12.9%
* Form 4 (change in ownership over 10% and transactions by insiders) must be filed within 2 business days (Ryan Cohen and new board member are subject to this one)
* Forms 13-D (ownership over 5%) & Form 3 (new steaks over 10% and initial statements by insiders) must be filed within 10 days (Other large buyers are subject to form 13-D and the new board members are subject to form 3)

The Important Part:

Because we didn't have a Form 4 filed today by Ryan Cohen the massive move Wednesday was not fueled by him picking up an additional 7%. This means he likely still has dry powder to buy more stock if he wants it. Additionally no forms 13-D or 3 means that the new directors may not have picked up shares yet either (if they want them). Additional share buying from RC/Friends could help send this to the moon   🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀

I am still mad, despite being in profit cuz I have no fucking idea how it is possible for a stock to drop 20 percent after open without crushing negative news. I have never seen something like this. However, there is no room for panic. Apple is expected to have historic earnings in less than 2 weeks and the stock experienced a huge dip today, GME fell hard also and every fucking autist here was buying it. We finished the day at 8 percent up.

I would not judge anyone who sales next week, not everyone needs to be a long term investor, but fuck the paper handed mfos who bought shares today and immediatly sold 1 hour later. How much can you actually lose? The absolute bottom is 4 per share and that would put the company at 2.5 bil valuation. The brand name is worth more than that and BB is a significant player in the IoT, Cybersecurity and EV industries. The cyber firm Crowdstrike has  180 mil revenue compared to BB near 1 billion and is valued at 50 billion, ten times more than BB. If you are gonna paper hand, at least wait till you are an in profit, the retards  who sold GME after the last dip are deeply regretting it now.

SPY is traded in the US which means the market is full of Americans. Now some of these Americans are so committed to bull/bear gang that they have formed entire dynasties:

* https://forebears.io/surnames/call (21264)
* https://forebears.io/surnames/put (114)

21,264 vs. 114? Well maybe that's a little bullish, but surnames have existed for a long time and people [did use to spell 'put' with 2 t's](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/putt#Etymology_3).

* https://forebears.io/surnames/putt (3380)

Adding up the totals there are 3,494 Put(t)s in the country giving a bear:bull ratio of 7:1. Which makes sense because stonks go up about 7/8 of the time, give or take.

We can also see some famous bears and bulls here:

10 Calls vs. 9 Puts, which becomes 9 vs. 2 when you only look at Americans, which becomes 2 vs. 1 when you only look at the ones who are still alive. And finally

The absolute state of this clown. This is what we're up against.

My only wish is that he doesn't end with $ROPE. I'm all for institutions crashing and burning, but retail is just sad._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ A case for $LLY If you make pharma plays (*blessing be to his holiness Martin Shkreli*) you probably already know about $LLY's antibody treatment for COVID-19 called Bamlanivimab ([https://www.fda.gov/media/143602/download](https://www.fda.gov/media/143602/download)), so piss off.

This is for everyone else who has probably only heard of Regeneron's **monoclonal antibody** offering because the Overweight Orange Squatter at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave received a dose.

So why $LLY and why now, since this antibody treatment has been approved since November?

Well, as Einstein famously said, "*The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again, but expecting different results.*"

Unless you've just recovered from a coma, you know that in 5 days there will be a new proverbial sheriff in town in Washington, DC.  Along with him will be a new Covid Task Force and I bet you my $GME shares they will absolutely NOT stay the present course of, well, doing whatever the hell it is that's being done now.

Remember, there are already doses of Bamlanivimab (let's just call it "BAM" for short) because it's an existing drug that received FDA Emergency Use Authorization for Covid. $LLY is already making more BAM and, more importantly, $LLY is already testing BAM against the mutated versions of Covid (TL;DR- looking good for the UK variant, not so good for the SA variant). Remember also that $LLY struck a deal with the US Government for $1,250 per dose of BAM.

Now the tricky thing about BAM is that it has to be administered early, when Covid is first detected. It's also an intravenous drug, so administration takes a few hours. This of course has been a logistical nightmare for over-stretched healthcare facilities.

BTW, if you want to see if BAM is already available near you go to [https://protect-public.hhs.gov/pages/therapeutics-distribution#distribbution-locations](https://protect-public.hhs.gov/pages/therapeutics-distribution#distribbution-locations)

Anyway, my thesis is the Biden team will push for some kind of centralized Covid Crisis Centers (yeah, I freaking love alliteration, bite me) that will do (1) Testing, (2) Therapeutics, and (3) Vaccinations.  Imagine it: get a rapid test for Covid and, if it's appropriate, head over to Area B for $LLY's BAM treatment. If your rapid test is negative, well head over to Area C for Vaccination.

Well, thank you for coming to my TEDTalk.

If you think I'm full of shit, please do consider something like $XPH because I guarantee you in five days the Biden Administration is going to come out swinging for the fence on a changed-up Covid response.  If you think I might be onto something, stop and ponder Covid pharma company names-which company names already come to mind: Pfzier, J&J, and Regeneron? That's why I'm thinking $LLY is my dark horse.

Coincidentally, these are 3 of the 4 directors that will not be standing for reelection, and are being replaced by Ryan and Co.

Personally, I'm not worried. Gamestop needs less deadweight in its leadership, and by selling in a bullish uptrend, they've demonstrated exactly the lack of vision that made them unfit leaders.

Alright, shut the fuck up about GME for a second and Im gonna make you money. y'all heard alot about PLUG from a few places as of late. Yes, it has exploded 135% in the last month alone but it isn't over. Right now, the sentiment is bearish and I agree in the short term, but long term PLUG is only going to keep growing. There are a few key points I want to highlight.

PLUG is single-highhandedly the largest hydrogen-fuel-cell titan in the industry. 20 years of industry under its belt, it now services Amazon with 40,000 active forklifts and Walmart uses roughly 10,000 active vehicles. Now, they are partnering with two more titans. Renault and SK Group. The French and South Korean markets respectively. First, Renault. Renault is well established in France, and is backed by the government itself. The deal with Renault is HUGE for plug in the European market. **The two plan to establish an innovation center for development of fuel cell technology in LCV vehicles** ***for*** **future Renault platforms. Initially, heavy vans and utility. They plan on combining manufacturing with Renault, establishing a vertically integrated fuel cell stack system and a manufacturing center in France. Expansion of refueling systems to accommodate the new market. The deal will only accelerate in the future as Renault plans to adopt Plug Power technology in commercial fleets.** Why is Renault Interested? Well, the EU announced a plan calling for Europe to have at least six gigawatts of renewable hydrogen electrolyzers by 2024 (A critical period for PLUG for a few more reasons) and the production of up to 1 million tonnes of renewable hydrogen. Doable, sure, but the bigger picture is this:

This is almost exactly how the rise of the solar industry happened. EU plans into the future. The European Union unveiled a plan this month to invest hundreds of billions of euros in technologies enabling it to get a substantial share of its energy from hydrogen by 2050. This is potentially **insane**.

([https://ec.europa.eu/energy/sites/ener/files/hydrogen\_strategy.pdf](https://ec.europa.eu/energy/sites/ener/files/hydrogen_strategy.pdf))

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Second group. SK Group is planning to invest 1.5 billion USD in an intention to form a joint venture next year. The goal is to provide South Korea (and later a possibility of the larger Asian Market) hydrogen fuel cell systems. Particularly, Infrastructure and electrolyzers (power stations, basically). There is, however, no information if PLUG is planning on directly partnering with any manufacturers in Korea. (I will get to this later). Why is SK Group interested in Plug? Plans call to build a liquid hydrogen plant with an annual capacity of 30,000 tons in Incheon in **2023**, to be scaled up to 280,000 tons in **2025**. The South Korean government's commitment to shift the to Hydrogen with 729 Million dollars this year. A 30% increase from last year.

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Now, whats the point of all this infrastructure? I understand the powerplants but is the future just going to be us driving in Amazon forklifts?* \- Says you, a dumbass who doesnt do DD and leaves it up to others in what is basically a Casino.

Sweet summer child..

Hydrogen fuel is going to be big in the automotive scene. Yes, Papa Musk hates it, so fucking what? keep buying one year out calls @ 50% OTM and tell Musk to fuck off with how much bank you're going to make.

GM may have made a statement that they are going for ALL hydrogen back in 2017, but they have since rescinded that statement. Their Hydrogen plan still remains though, Fuel-cell power-trains will be used in military and commercial vehicles. ([https://twitter.com/mikewayland/status/1283734665157922816?lang=en](https://twitter.com/mikewayland/status/1283734665157922816?lang=en))

Honda is already selling a vehicle with hydrogen fuel cell technology. The Honda Clarity. They plan on expanding on the line greatly as they seem to be extremely set on becoming green.

Hyundai is already selling a vehicle with hydrogen fuel cell technology, the Hyundai Nexo. **Hyundai Motor Group and its suppliers plan to spend of 7.6 trillion won (US$6.7 billion) through 2030 to raise production of fuel cells by more than 200-fold as the South Korean automaker targets to become a key player in the new-energy vehicle technology.**

So much money is flowing into Hydrogen fuel cell technology, why is noone capitalizing on it?

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The play: Wait for volatility to die down, PLUG has had a massive run up. Truly tremendous, and I'm glad to have been in PLUG for a long while. The hype is almost certainly blown up, and general market attitude is that it is a sell which I agree with.

TLDR: PLUG is going to return from low-earth orbit to refuel, my price target is 50 by mid-FEB before PLUG does a Hindenburg and the price fucking explodes. 🚀🚀🚀

GM stock is gonna be huge over the next couple years. Their moving almost entirely to an EV lineup, we all already know about the green energy spending plan, ton's of cash on hand, good vehicle market share already, reasonably priced right now.

Their CEO also had a good interview on Freakanomics podcast a few weeks ago. She's completely upending their old stuffy corporate culture, getting rid of dress codes, focus on innovation.

NOW FOR THE REALLY IMPORTANT PART so try to stay with me

**GM** is 2 of the 3 letters in GME (that means it's 66.6666666% gamestop)  
**GM** makes electric vehicles now  
TESLA makes electric vehicles  
TESLA's stock price is $845 as I write this

66.666666666% multiplied by $845 is $563.33

Price target for **GM** is $563.33

🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ GOEV: thoughts about Tony Aquila's hints during CES Q&A I've looked closely at the Q&A /interview with Tony Aquila from two days ago ( youtube.com/watch?t=1469&v=3KhIf0-0mX8 starts at \~24:30 ) and I'm thinking the following:

GOEV is working on a platform or franchise to create custom cars, for businesses and private consumers; but mostly businesses, health orgs and government. I'm thinking custom EV's such as:

* doctor or vet dispatch units which need refrigeration, defibrillators, all sorts of medical equipment that needs proper storage, but also 24/7 quick self-driving release to the emergency area.
* mobile examination and laboratory vans
* police and special operations support vehicles
* mobile computer unit.
* hotel, resort, venue experience vans to entertain and impress customers
* mobile advertisement for, let's say, Samsung - no need to go to their showroom/store. Also, if Samsung wants to launch a self-driving taxi service they could customize the car.
* robot/drone dispatch car for shipping companies. Think about sending multiple packages to a neighborhood with the car and then let the drone fly door to door.
* self-driving monitoring/safety cars or street-view like applications.

The hints from Canoo's chairman indicate that they are working on a platform that can be used to assemble these cars. I imagine it's a franchise that the local repair shops/garages that deal with fossil fuel cars can transition to.

Unfortunately, the way that Tony delivered his message during the Q&A was seen as low key in the eyes of investors who own GOEV to make a quick buck. This laid-back delivery of words created uncertainty, hence the fall in stock. But the ideas he communicated seem revolutionary and, to be honest quite social and positive towards the local SMe's.

What do you guys think?

Myself, I'm happy with my GOEV stock, but I can imagine that the call options owners are freaking out, especially since Tony mentioned that they expect deliveries somewhere in end of 2022.

I'm hoping that my investment can help me buy a Canoo car someday when Tony's team makes it happen in 2022+. Then I'll order a Popemobile BangBus GOEV. /remindme 🚀_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ 1563 Shares.

My assumptions:

1. The dollar will not collapse in the next 10-20 years, so I expect to see similar conditions as the dollar will remain the global reserve currency.

2. Businesses and financial advisors are following these same trends as I am.

3. Crypto, although stirring up the pot, will be more of a speculative play rather than a safe haven against crashes at least for the next 10 - 15 years.

Facts:

1. After the dot com bubble burst in late 2000, silver jumped as high as roughly 9 times (varies) from it's initial drop.
2. After the 2007/2008 crash, silver rose 4 times (varies).
3. Silver also went up in the 80s crash but some of that was due to market manipulation.

The peak for both were 2 years after the bottom drop.

4. After the 2020 crash, silver's bottom was roughly $12.50 per ounce. Thus in 2 years time I expect it to reach $70 per ounce (average), and this doesn't include the industrial increase and shortages that may soon come in the next 10 years.

As you can tell by the title I believe that company is WBA. WBA has been severely undervalued for the past year and has just started to rise significantly. 

Some of the factors that have allowed the stock to increase has been a sale of the overseas distribution business. This allows more focus on the growing ecommerce business and the task of employing MDs at 600+ locations.

But as you guessed it, that stuff is already priced in. So what's the thing that is currently being undervalued? or not being taken in account? Yes Walgreens vaccine distribution. Already Walgreens has started the process of distributing the vaccine. 

However Walgreens will not profit for the distribution directly. Meaning that they wont be paid large sums of money from the government to vaccinate the public. BUT they will benefit from the increased foot traffic in their stores when the community has to come in for **2** doses. 

In an earnings call on Jan 7th management downplayed the benefits from distributing the vaccine. Saying that the benefit of "COVID vaccines is likely to be offset by COVID headwind". Spoiler alert! : Covid headwinds have been happening since March. How dare you tell your telling your shareholders that the benefit of distributing the vaccine is nil. 

This is why I think that the company is intentionally downplaying the benefits of distribution in order to post a next quarter earnings beat. 

Barclays analyst Steven Valiquette states: "the  Covid-19 vaccine  benefit  will  likely  be quite material on the core retail pharmacy side as it is largely expected to offset most of the \~$200  mln Covid/flu headwinds the  company expects in  F2Q21."

The theory of management downplaying the distribution in order to beat estimates is strengthened when you look at CEO Stefano Pessina. Over the summer he planned to step down, which makes sense because the man is 79. But also if you were finally ready for retirement, wouldn't you want a little cash to throw around? The bulk of Stefano's $8.5 billion dollar fortune is purely WBA stock. So is it crazy to think that he could use a manufactured earnings beat to give one last pump to the stock?

And that's where us autist come in. If Stefano is going to profit off this, so will we.

Welcome.


For those of you who don't know, the greatest short squeeze in history is the Volkswagen Infinity Squeeze of 2008. For a very brief moment, VW became the most valuable company in the world, surpassing Exxon Mobile.


How did this happen?


Well, VW was in bad shape financially. The financial crisis had hit them particularly hard, and short sellers gambled strong on the prospect of VW going bankrupt. Even before that, they were already in massive debt. They were, seemingly, done for.


Enter Porsche. The luxury car company had long held a stake in VW, but it was sitting around 30%. Porsche made it known that they had no interest in taking over VW. Plus, the financial crisis hit Porsche as hard as anyone else. For all the short sellers knew, Volkswagen was a sitting duck.


Now, Volkswagen is a German company, so the state of Lower Saxony held a 20% stake. And about 5% of the shares were held in various index funds, which had to maintain certain ratios and couldn't just sell if the price changed. That, plus Porsche's 30% interest, took 55% of the shares off the table.


Unbeknownst to the rest of the world, Porsche was making moves. They were buying up VW stock in massive numbers, eventually controlling about 74% of the company. That left just 1% of shares available, not the 45% that short sellers had assumed. It was mathematically impossible for short sellers to cover their positions, but they had no idea.


On Sunday October 26, 2008, while markets were closed, Porsche announced what they had done, and then said, "the disclosure should give so called short sellers – meaning financial institutions which have betted or are still betting on a falling share price in Volkswagen – the opportunity to settle their relevant positions without rush and without facing major risks."


Naturally, and hilariously, this statement had the opposite effect.


The news spread, panic ensued, and short sellers rushed to cover their positions. Some paid over 1,000 Euros a share. Even converted to real money, that's a lot. Owners of the shares could literally name their price and short sellers would pay it. It was, "like a nuclear bomb going off in our faces," said one hedge fund manager. "A short squeeze to infinity."


People were literally in tears.


Porsche made $10 billion on the deal, with the CEO alone earning a cool $80 million.



Short sellers lost $30 billion.


-----


So what can we learn from this?


Short sellers will cry if you make them cover their positions.

This absolute 🌈🐻 starts the article off by saying oh, short squeeze is an "investable" opportunity, but then tells us how technical are bad. 

For those who can't access the article:

"Prices are above the rising 50-day moving average line and well above the rising 200-day moving average line. With the 200-day line around $9 and prices around $40 we can declare that prices are extended or overbought compared to this indicator.

The On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line has been strong since early August and the slow stochastic indicator tells us that prices are overbought. The upper shadows above $40 tell us that traders are beginning to reject these gains. 

Bottom line strategy: Right at this juncture in time, the charts of GME show more risk than reward. Stand aside. "

&#x200B;

This absolute retard who supposedly had 43 years of experience and still believes technicals are king and actually matter something on huge news reports. As if Ryan Cohen being added to board of directors isn't a catalyst, as if the shorts having to cover isn't a reason for a short squeeze. Betcha that VW short squeeze had real good technicals and wasn't overbought, yikes. 

All this shows us is that boomers still haven't caught on and boomer retail ain't even dipping their feet in yet. While there's definitely less 🌈🐻s now, most people haven't bought into GME yet which means it has so much more room to grow. 

**TLDR**; The rocket hasn't left yet.

- Very well regarded Mark Tritton (former Target CMO) became a CEO just over a year ago. He’s the only the 3rd CEO and 1st outsider in the company’s history who’s very optimistic about a turnaround

- they’ve sold non-core assets and expect to raise additional $350mm-$450mm in cash from non-core that will be pushed towards digital sales

- Digital Comps up 94% YoY. Penetration online continues to grow drastically with a 31% annual growth rate

- More digital means wider margins. Gross Margins increased from 32.2% to 35.4% which simply means they make 3% more on every sale which is huge. 

- They’ve increased the planned share buy-back from $675mm to $825mm in the next 3 years. That’s 1/3 of the fucking float which signals the confidence of the management 

- Haters might point Net income was negative. True, but it was mainly due to $2.469 billion NON recurring  restructuring cost. If we omit that cost, the net income over the past three years is +$500mm. 

- EV/EBITDA is 10.01 vs conservative 12.7 industry average at the time of this post. So that alone should put us at a fair value of $35/share today. Based on forward EBITDA for 2021, that’s $39/share in the next 12 months. And that’s not accounting for share buyback.


Sounds good right. But wait, there’s more

Of course, I'm 2 contracts in 3/19 10c for BB gang. I do not question the wetahd wisdom.

But Joe Biden and his Blue Buddies have come for the bulls. 1.9 trillion stimulus (it won't be Big Poor who pays the taxes on that) and a call for a $15 minimum wage? Retail and Wendy's franchisees are quaking in their boots.

It's going to be red on red on red for any business that makes big bucks off of busting the ass of the working class. Big Tech will do just fine but it's a day of reckoning for ~~wage slave overseers~~ small business owners and franchisers.

I'm in for 3/19 17.50p on MIK.

This play is dirt cheap with little downside, and yet to recover to pre-COVID highs, even with the explosion in fiber and 5G. Lumen currently sits around $10, pre-COVID it was around $15, but it can run so much further. Simplywall.st has a price target of $45, I would say that’s crazy but with GameStops value correction lately, who knows lol

Lumen has a big competitive advantage thanks to century link, and that’s its 450,000 mile fiber network. That places it in the top 2 in the US. With fiber and 5G becoming more mainstream, expect this stock to climb.  It’s been shifting it’s business away from the dying business model of Century Link, working on a rebrand, paying off debt, and have had good earnings. 

As lumen moves further from century links business and starts benefiting from its Level 3 acquisition which will boost profits and cashflow for years, I don’t see this going any lower anytime soon. 

I may be retarded, but I can’t pass this one up.
Wall Street has a history of incorrectly valuing restructuring companies. This is one of those times. 



TL;DR : Lumn is a good value play with little downside and Burry thinks so too

Anyone who has been following these posts since last week can see that my correction thesis is starting to bear fruit today. Opex dates are notorious for starting more substantial (5-10%) correction periods in the market. It’s no surprise that today is opex and that the market is selling off. 

Those of us shorting this market now need to see follow through selling. Dip buyers are going to show up because they have been rewarded for doing so on every dip since last October. If the bearish crab pattern I’ve previously posted is going to play out we need to see at least 2-3 more days in a row of selling to get some confirmation that a real 4-8 week correction in the markets are going to take place. 

As I’ve also previously stated, I don’t think this is the beginning of a new bear market. For that to happen I would need to see some very key technical levels broken. Until that happens, I view this as just a potential cool off period before the bull market continues. 

So, moving forward there are two things I want to see to confirm this is more than just a little wimpy 1 day correction.

1. - Today I want to see the SP500 close at the lows of the day with high volume selling into the close. 

2. When the markets come back next Tuesday after a long weekend I want to see another big red day. 

If those two things happen then I will be adding to my short positions on any bounce that is likely to follow sometime next week.

XPEV is valued at around 39 Billion, and Nio at 90 Billion.

Nio has delivered 36,700 cars in 2020

 XPEV around 27000 cars

Li Auto with around 32600 cars.

They've outsold XPEV and are right on the heels of NIO. They don't have a name as catchy, but they are very popular in China.

I think they have the most room to grow out of the EVs and are most likely to pop.

No doubt 2020 was an epic year for the market. A lot of people, especially ordinary Americans, made a lot of life-changing money, and that's good.

More and more people are coming out of the woodwork talking about 2000s, market crash, etc. Even though I am a moron, for the life of me I cannot see any reason for a massive market crash to happen anytime soon. Do any of you idiots see anything wrong with my DD on the subject, below?

1. JPOW, the guy with the money printer that goes BRRRRRRRR, confirmed this week that there is not going to be any adjustments to the massive bond-buying/QE program anytime soon
2. Interest rates will remain at zero throughout 2023, meaning the discount rate will remain at 0, driving up the present value of financial assets
3. Janet Yellen is known to be extremely dovish, which at the very least won't hurt
4. We're currently in what is likely to be the worst phase of the pandemic, meaning: the worst economic news is coming out now and the latest round of stimulus isn't reflecting yet in the economic data
5. While vaccinations are starting to pick up steam, by no means are they close to the point where society begins to reopen, which will likely begin happening in late March/April.
6. There's MASSIVE pent-up demand from 2020 that will be pulled forward to 2021: going out, dining, travel, nightclubs, bars, retail, entertainment, sports, seeing friends and family - this will provide an epochal stimulus to the U.S. economy, and we will see truly blockbuster GDP growth numbers after Q1 2021
7. The savings rate for Americans is at an ATH
8. Consumer debt is at an all-time low
9. Fintech firms like Robinhood, laugh at them as we may (even though most people here use them), simply have made equities and derivatives accessible for the average person. Trust me, you're not special for signing up for a TD Ameritrade account and downloading the Thinkorswim app - anyone can. The UI just sucks and most people would rather use Robinhood. The age of the retail investor is here - look at $BB, $GME, etc. What would be the catalyst for retail investors to pull out of the market? And in terms of RH making money on the back end, the reality is most people don't care if their trade gets filled at $10.48 or $10.46 as long as they see COMMISSION: $0. Why is this any different from a deli charging you $2.50 instead of $2 for a bottle of Poland Spring because they pay 2.5% to their cc processor?
10. U.S. companies are sitting on a record cash pile: [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-companies-cash/u-s-companies-sitting-on-record-cash-pile-sp-global-idUSKBN28I36I](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-companies-cash/u-s-companies-sitting-on-record-cash-pile-sp-global-idUSKBN28I36I)
11. Transformational industries like EV's, hydrogen power, big data, cloud computing, renewable energy - this is really happening, and happening now. And without Trump in the way, these trends will only accelerate (climate change, electrification, and so forth). Industries like clean energy have taken decades to get to this point. While DoorDash and Uber are cool, they're also just consumer conveniences, so people can spend $33 ordering pizza and wings to their overpriced apartment. While the story of the 2010's was consumer convenience, the market potential of the 2020's we will go back to major, earth-changing industry.
12. While there are certainly mini-bubbles, isn't that more healthy than one massive bubble? If investors overprice hydrogen power stocks and they correct by 25%, it doesn't ruin the economy like the dot-com boom, subprime crisis etc.
13. Rents went down in major metropolitan areas like NYC, San Francisco, etc. - which means people, specifically MILLENNIALS whose assets topped $10 trillion for the first time recently, will have more disposable income to save and invest. While rents won't stay low forever, this will provide a massive short-term stimulus for the millions of people who call these areas home. Moreover, incentives - like 1/2/3/4 months free - will put more money into savings of younger people, who spend more than boomers.

I see interest rates going up, inflation, and mispricing of future income from these new industries like EV's, renewables, and so forth (aka "bubbles") being the biggest counterarguments here, but interested to hear what the smart money on wsb is thinking

I am also an engineer at an OEM. IoT  has been getting more popular lately but BB isn't doing anything special  here. Companies like TopCon (Tractors/Combines), Rexroth (Mobile  Equipment), IFM (Industrial), ect. are way ahead of the game here with  this tech and have been doing it a lot longer. BB says they have 63% of  the market on EV's? How many companies actually make EV's? Not many. If I  was an automaker I'd be looking to adjacent industries for an already  existing tech to use.

This  is what TESLA did by using the RC controller from Rexroth, which is  mainly a mobile hydraulics supplier (i.e. construction equipment). Every TESLA car has one of these controllers under their hood. 

TopCon  has 15 years in this IoT space and self driving tractors all use this  technology. They are also thinking about breaking into the automotive  field as well.

If you're an  engineer looking into IoT, you've probably heard of IFM as well. These  guys are like the Cadillac of IoT/Touchscreen displays. Incredibly smart  engineers work here and all their products are made with a focus on  data security. I've probably sat down in a dozen or so meetings with  various companies about IoT. Most are generic bland dashboards and use  the same hardware. So from an OEM standpoint, how do I choose which one  to use? Well who has the most value-add in this space, in terms of  cooperation/engineering support for integrating their tech into our  equipment? IFM is leagues above these other companies in this instance.  Most of the companies out there treat IoT like it's a side hustle but  it's going to be huge going forward no doubt.

Tldr;  BB will probably get squeezed out of this space like they did in the  phone industry because major players are ahead of the game compared to  them. Partnered with AWS? Oh boy! Better watch out! News flash, the  companies listed above all use either AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure for  IoT data already._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Bought in for BB and dropped $4500 right away! Off to a great start! To the moon? 🚀🚀🚀 _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ After GameStop surge, market analysts share which other stocks could see short squeeze rallies. I bet CNBC has an Unpaid Intern reading WSB. _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Investment Thesis: Long Transocean Equity **Investment Thesis: Long Transocean Ltd. ($RIG) Stock** 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 

I started a position in Transocean's stock ($RIG). This is a risky but highly asymmetric opportunity. Transocean has \~20% short interest, which I believe exists largely because shorts haven't appreciated the dramatic recovery in macro. They think offshore drilling is a dead industry, and over the last decade, they have been right. But if rigs are materially retired and oil prices come higher, dayrates to incentivize new work have to go higher. Any rigs built before 2010 will never see another contract, per management. Transocean has 9 of the top 30 Harsh environment semi subs. And all the active rigs can drill in 12k feet of water. But the real catalyst is the price of oil. If I am correct, Transocean's EBITDA and FCF figures will be much higher than sellside consensus is penciling today. Transocean's assets are actively contracted; 80% of the revenue forecast is contracted today.

Sell-side and shorts think that at 60$/bbl, all producer discipline erodes again. Private equity shale turns the taps back on, and we're back to massive oversupply. But shale can't supply the world the oil it needs. The big players need 100M barrel projects to secure the oil future, and renewables supply is not even going to be even remotely close to what we need in the next 5 years. Shale only lasts 1-3 years, and 60-80% of deposits are gone in year 1. Offshore drilling is a 20 year useful life on those mega deposits, but is it expensive and hard to drill, taking longer for barrels to flow. That's why offshore drilling is so expensive.

Oil bulls basically believe shale won't be enough to fulfill demand, so we will need offshore drilling. If oil goes to 85$ and more, RIG could 7x. There is no liquidity risk, until at least 1H 2023 based on maturities and existing liquidity. GS maps $700M liquidity at YE 2022, so 1H2023 would be the potential first filing. This is also a reopening play. EBITDA doubles when dayrates go up 75 kpd. The hope is that when reopening occurs, that supply/demand imbalance is corrected quickly.Shale won't be enough to satisfy world demand and that players stop looking to shale as it's not a great return. Offshore is higher upfront capex but way better return especially at low prices. Shale is like a bandaid that can only work at sustainably high oil prices.

**What is Transocean?**  
Transocean is a large cap, a leading provider of offshore contract drilling services for oil and gas wells. Operated 45 mobile offshore drilling units, with 28 ultra-deepwater floaters, 14 harsh environment floaters and 3 midwater floaters. They build drilling rigs, related equipment and work crews on a dayrate basis to drill oil and gas wells. Transocean specializes in demanding regions of the global offshore drilling business with a focus on ultra-deepwater and harsh environment drilling services. They have one of the most versatile fleets in the world.

Deep water is the primary focus of large-scale offshore oil exploration, because most of the shallow water resources have already been explored. The cost to remove a barrel of oil from the ground for deep water is higher than for shallow water, with the breakeven coming at 60$/barrel. Given the long lifetime of exploration projects and production after resources have been identified, the demand for deep-water drilling rigs depends primarily on long-term expectations for oil prices. Oil prices are steadily increasing, so the markets are projecting that deep water drilling will at least be marginally economical.

**Transocean: The Lone Survivor**
Transocean is the only offshore driller still solvent after the collapse of energy. Trading at 20% short interest, with liquidity and runway through 2022. Opportunity was created when all of Transocean’s competitors were filing for bankruptcy. Then came some nasty litigation with one of their lenders. All behind us. Offshore has a reason to exist and that shale is never coming back to 2019 levels. It’s a levered call option on oil. Offshore believer. Real business with contracts that weren’t cut in the trough commodity cycle, but if we don’t get higher oil prices by end of FY22, runway gets thin very fast. And the industry is years late on scrapping underperforming assets. Transocean has the best assets, best cap structure and best management team. The majority of Transocean's worse capitalized peers have all filed for bankruptcy and have finally started to retire rigs. It is inevitable that there’s consolidation and the overall rig asset pool starts to shrink.

**Capital Structure Improvements**  
I firmly believe there is no risk of Transocean filing for bankruptcy until 1H 2023. Transocean has active contracts with the biggest oil majors on the majority of vessels. Transocean has total liquidity of $2.9B, with cash of $1.4B, $200M for debt service and a $1.3B revolver completely undrawn. During Q3-2020, Transocean reduced debt by 1B$, reducing interest expense and extended liquidity runway. Recent litigation with one of their creditors, Whitebox, was recently judged in Transocean's favor, and any risk from that litigation creating a near-term bankruptcy is completely in the rear-view.

**Macro Overview**  
Oil prices going up just another $10-15 / bbl makes a big difference for offshore drillers, but specifically Transocean because the company has spent a lot of time retooling their wells, simplifying designs to make them more profitable at the $50 / bbl mark. Any sustained pricing increase around $50 / bbl bodes very well for offshore drilling, where Transocean’s competitiveness has increased a lot over the past few years. They are taking market share from the bankrupt players.

The big question is what happens to shale in 2021. I believe short cycle/high decline curve projects are not coming back. In FY20, oil major management teams were 1) managing their balance sheet and 2) reinvesting in long cycle, large deposit projects, meaning offshore. Over 10 years, 0 reinvestment has gone to offshore.

**Dayrates**  
When entering 2020, dayrates (cost to rent a rig) exceeded $300k and ultra-deepwater fixtures were around $250k a day, which represented a 100% increase from fixtures signed earlier in 2019. Then Covid crushed demand, while temporary increases in supply due to disputes among major producers broke 2020 momentum. 

But delays in awards weren’t cancelled, they were deferred by 12 months. Bidding activity in Q3-2020 doubled from Q2-2020’s low point and returned to pre-covid levels. During Q3-2020, they participated in 18 bids, the same amount they did in Q4-2019, before Covid hit.

The marketable supply of rigs is likely to fall at a pace which meets contracted rig count, which is already happening. So when oil prices stabilize at more favorable levels, an inflection in rig contracting should have an almost immediate and positive impact on dayrates, due to the shortage of marketable rigs and the expense associated with reactivating stacked rigs. 

**Rig Oversupply: Currently Being Addressed**  
The industry is addressing rig oversupply. Old rigs are getting stacked, so the real active marketable fleet is shrinking. If an oil major wants to sign an offshore driller into a long-term arrangement, it’s going to require a rig reactivation. But if it takes 50M$ to reactivate an asset, at today’s dayrate it isn’t possible. Therefore, dayrates MUST go higher so the operator can get compensated on the front end for these reactivation costs. The relative utilization of high-spec assets is only going to get better. Management’s expectation is that the older, less capable assets will be too costly to keep around and are not viable going forward. I believe many of these rigs will never find another contract and will be scrapped, improving market dynamics.

Simply put, while oil is oversupplied today, I think we are much closer to an oil supply **shortage** than the market thinks. Oil & gas companies have slashed investments in new wells at an incredible rate. The reduced spending will take a toll on future production very soon. Investors underestimate the amount of money required to build out the required renewable energy infrastructure across the globe. 

**Summary**  
Transocean has most competitive floating feet in the industry, with the strongest and most lucrative backlog, providing visibility on future cash flows. They’re the leader in harsh environment and ultra-deepwater drilling. Management showed prudence in shoring up the balance sheet from 2016 - 2020, and I believe they will be rewarded for those efforts with significant market share gains in 2021 and beyond. The setup of \~20% short interest and increasing oil prices point to a win for RIG.

I have previously provided DD in two separate posts: [Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kwo5p5/callaway/) and [Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kx7sh6/callaway_part_2/). **As mentioned previously, we are talking about a $2.5 billion market cap company that has $1.7+ billion revenues of their own and just bought Topgolf, which has revenues of $1.1+ billion.** The only issue about this company is its stupid fucking ticker, which is $ELY. As a fellow retard pointed out to me yesterday in Part 2 (shoutout u/rwm3188), the **ticker is named after the founder Ely Callaway, which is an absolute supreme autist name**, and deserves our full autistic support. **🚀**

In the last post, I focused on golf in general and showed how more people are playing golf and buying more golf equipment/apparel. This time I want to talk to you about a word your girlfriend’s boyfriend uses often, and that word is SYNERGY. Every Topgolf location now uses CALLaway equipment, and they are expanding quickly. I mean look at the website as it shows you all the “coming soon” locations (cite: [here](https://topgolf.com/us/locations-by-state/)), and they are expanding into Asia: (cite: [here](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/continued-expansion-topgolf-and-franchise-partner-announce-development-plans-for-new-venues-throughout-southeast-asia-301201838.html)). **Topgolf has experienced 30%+ yoy revenue growth each year since 2017, and it’s only speeding up.** **🚀**

**Topgolf is operating at a better capacity to pre-covid thanks to the spread-out open bay layout they use. Further, it licenses its ball tracing tech to other driving ranges, and this revenue stream is up 200%+ yoy.** Imagine if CALLaway would be able to pair this tech with their clubs. Synergies and stuff. Get with it retards and hammer the $ELY stock and February 19, 2021 $30c. Earnings is on February 9, 2021, and we fly into earnings. AUTISTS ASSEMBLE! **🚀**

**TLDR: $ELY to the moon 🚀🌙**

How did I come across this stock? Well, my mom and sister constantly, I mean constantly, go to Michael's. They want to purchase canvases, art supplies, and other activities to stay away from screens.

Not only that, it's incredibly easy to purchase and they have a great curbside experience.

That's so low compared to any tech stock valued at 1000% 2023 earnings.

If you liked my last "Tendies and Taxes" post, you're in for a treat as this edition may save you some big money. If you didn't see the last one here's the link: [Tendies and Taxes Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kwuo7q/tendies_and_taxes_info_for_your_wifes_boyfriend/) *Also, this is 100% not legal advice and is intended for general educational purposes.*

One of the biggest questions I got was "Bro I hit big but wtf do I do about taxes, specifically estimated payments?" Well good news, Papa is once again here to break it down for even WSBs to understand. If you're wondering, why should I care? If you realize and recognize tendies (gains) from your stonks/options you need evaluate your filing status and prior withholdings to ensure you have sufficient withholdings come tax filing time because, ***if you do not, you face potential audits and/or penalties, and interest.***

To begin, the deadline for making estimated tax payment for Q4 (the final quarter of 2020) is TODAY.

Taxpayers who paid too little tax during 2020 can still avoid a tax-time bill and possible penalties by making a quarterly estimated tax payment now, directly to the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”). ***The deadline for making a payment for the fourth quarter of 2020 is Friday, January 15, 2021.***

Income taxes are pay-as-you-go. This means that by law, taxpayers are required to pay most of their taxes during the year as income is received. There are two ways to do this:

1. Withholding from paychecks, pension payments, Social Security benefits or certain other government payments including unemployment compensation in some cases. This is how most people pay most of their tax.

2. Making quarterly estimated tax payments throughout the year to the IRS. Self-employed people and investors, among others, often pay tax this way.

Either method can help avoid a surprise tax bill at tax time and the accompanying penalties that often apply. If a taxpayer failed to make required quarterly estimated tax payments earlier in the year, making a payment to cover these missed payments, as soon as possible, will usually lessen and may even eliminate any possible penalty.

Taxpayers can check their possible tax liability by using the [IRS Tax Withholding Estimator](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/tax-withholding-estimator). 

*TL;DR* **File your taxes and consult with tax professionals**. I represent taxpayers across the country before the IRS and several northeastern state tax authorities and would like to see as many of you avoid dealing with them.

The parallels are insane between Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY) and GameStop.

GME: dying boomer Game brick-and-mortar retail store shorted to the ground and given hope by innovative activist investor Ryan Cohen
BBBY: dying boomer brick-and-mortar retail store shorted to the ground and given hope by innovative CEO Mark J. Tritton

GME: #1 most shorted high-cap company with 104% short float
BBBY: #4 most shorted high-cap company with 70% short float + $825M share buy back program (will further reduce the public float by ~25% which will put short float on par with GME)

GME: low of $2.57 in April 2020, has short squeezed 15x to $42 (Michael Burry got in under $5)
BBBY: low of $3.43 in April 2020, has short squeezed 8x to $28 (Michael Burry got in under $5). If GME can hit $42 by fucking shorts, BBBY can too at the very least.

GME: shorted to the ground by the infamous Melvin Capital
BBBY: yes the boomers at Melvin Capital are also shorting the hell outta this one

Most importantly Cramer approved! He's been bringing the CEO on Mad Money to talk, pumping this shit to boomers. Shorts are fucked in both GME and BBBY and will continue to drive up share price.

What is my price prediction for Amazon? Read until the end of the post as I reveal my price target for Amazon and why I believe it can deliver insane returns!🚀🚀🚀**

**\~Very Very Long Post\~**

Hello everyone and welcome to another stock price prediction! Today we are going to talk about Amazon and what’s the upside for the company! So, let’s go over the company a little before moving on to some fundamental, technical analysis, predictions and my price target for the stock in the next years & months.

So, let’s start by talking a little about [Amazon](https://ibb.co/47vPnY2), yeah, I know it’s one of the biggest companies in the world, but I believe Amazon is still undervalued & underappreciated compared to some of the highflyers that have generate insane returns in the past months, though most of them are still far from profitability and don’t have the growth across all the board like Amazon.

Maybe the market doesn't put as much attention in the numbers as I do but I would rather invest in a business which I consider to be healthy and growing rather than a what if stock like many of the recent inflated IPOs. Amazon is a trillion-dollar company growing at a double-digit pace as many companies that are a fraction of their size would kill for this numbers, but this hasn’t helped Amazon since September.

On a global scale e-commerce is expected to increase from 16% to 22% of retail sales by 2023. With the U.S. expected to increase its retail e-commerce sales from $374 billion to $476 billion by 2024.This is another thing that supports the growth that e-commerce has in front of it, both as total and as a % of the total retail sales. With the latest [report](https://ibb.co/jRMvB7x) showing a 24% increase in holiday e-commerce transactions and a 19% increase for the 2020 fiscal year.

E-commerce is showing signs that it will continue to gain share of the total market as a recent report projects that digital sales during the Black Friday-to-Cyber Monday period will grow by about 35% YOY, reaching [penetration](https://ibb.co/3StWbwz) of around 32% and growing by more 10B, as this continues to eat up market share from more traditional B&M retailers.

I think one of the biggest problems the company has, it’s the actual share price of the company, not the value. We have seen that a stock split can and will attract more buyers and the share price would probably see an accelerated rate of growth, just look at what happened with Tesla and Apple [recently](https://ibb.co/GFqGsjV). By splitting the stock just like [Apple](https://ibb.co/d766wL5) has done a number of times, this allows more individual investors to invest in the company, as they will be attracted by the cheaper share price. [Amazon](https://ibb.co/XStd5Jf) hasn’t done a share split since the dot com era, and it might be time for the company to take advantage of this hot bull market to actually go ahead with something like at least a 5-10:1 split.

So, let’s go a little through the latest quarter [results](https://ibb.co/Y8JHWdc) and [guidance](https://ibb.co/mCT3T43). The company increased the operating cash flow by more than 55% to over $55B for the latest twelve months, with free cash flow also increasing by $6B, while they managed to avoid significant [dilution](https://ibb.co/6bYCLhx) of the company, with only 7M additional shares being outstanding.

The net sales also increased 37% in the last quarter to just over $96B, an increase of more than $26B over 2019, which is an insane 36% increase y/y yet again.

This year Amazon has also pushed their [Prime Day](https://ibb.co/1RPqhMv) ahead of schedule, which resulted in the two biggest days ever for third-party small & medium sellers, which saw an increase in sales of over 60% over 2019, even bigger than Amazon own retail business.

Amazon continues to expand into multiple revenue streams, with the first Amazon [Fresh](https://ibb.co/9ZBqwKM) grocery store opened in California, which is offering both in-store and online products.

We also saw Amazon’s more profitable revenue streams meaning the services revenues increasing, with Amazon Studios continuing to produce original movies and TV-series while also expanding their offering to live sport games.

The company is also seeking to expand into the red-hot Video Gaming market, as they launched a new service Prime Gaming, available for free for Prime Members and also announced Luna which will be a cloud gaming service that will allow customers to play high-quality games on previously owned devices, thus not requiring bigger investments for many customers. They also continued to improve their [devices](https://ibb.co/VVkyDXX) like the Echo, Alexa, Ring and FireTV line of products, which feature more & more AI Improvements.

Amazon has also announced an expansion into the pharmacy business which put a lot of pressure on traditional pharmacy companies like CVS & Walgreens, while also announcing a new Halo service, aimed at helping customers improve their lifestyle.

I like companies that make me a lot of money, but I also like that they are [involved](https://ibb.co/r7C6NXs) in projects aimed at helping poorer communities around the world, with their latest Project Kuiper, being a low-earth orbit satellite constellation that is aiming to provide reliable & cheap internet access around the world.

And last but not least, let’s not forget about the biggest income provider as margin goes, the Amazon Web Services ([AWS](https://ibb.co/MkHgG7d)). Amazon continued to see significant customer demand for this product with multiple big companies like Global Payments & Moderna using their services. Alongside these 2 companies we also saw AWS providing even more data services for the [NFL](https://ibb.co/zbYySCp) and many more other companies. AWS has been a terrific revenue stream for Amazon, with [AWS](https://ibb.co/87614m9) having 1/3 of the market share for cloud infrastructure in the first half of 2020, as the compound annual growth of AWS has been 40% in the recent years, just below the other profitable [services](https://ibb.co/0Byn2R7) they offer on subscriptions services, advertising & payments, with the only revenue stream seeing a negative growth being the physical stores.

Overall, the company has seen a 28% compound annual [growth](https://ibb.co/mCwDCTb) in revenues since 2016 and an even bigger 68% [growth](https://ibb.co/jk57Qq9) in earnings/share, which is incredible to say the least.

So, before even starting, you should now that I am bull on Amazon but I am willing to hear other opinions so don’t be afraid to leave a comment down below!

I have made some predictions based on the growth rate of the company, the latest plans announced by them and used some estimates. So, keep in mind this are only projections and are calculated by myself, this is not an investment advice and you should do your own research and so on…

Firstly, let’s start with the Guidance that Amazon gave us for the 4th quarter, as they are expecting net sales between $112B and $121B implying a growth of between 28-38% over 2019. They also provided guidance for the operating income but this is heavily impacted by the problems we had in 2020 and that still continue to be around.

The company also is aiming to [optimize](https://ibb.co/0ZTfncc) the free cash flow which was up 26% y/y for Q3, as they are trying to dilute the shares as little as possible. The total net [SALES](https://ibb.co/7jsRCN5) for the last twelve months is nearing $348B which even adjusted for forex is still up 31%. Amazon has only 12% of their revenues coming the AWS right now, but this is by far the most profitable revenue for the company, as the increases in AWS sales have led to an over 90% [increase](https://ibb.co/ts6VKrb) in operating income from the previous year.

Let’s take a look at the last quarter’s results. We saw a big [INCREASE](https://ibb.co/qrpk3wR) in all 3 big revenue streams for Amazon, with the first 9 months of 2020 brining over $160B in sales in North America, $67B from International sales and almost $33B from AWS. For my [projections](https://ibb.co/4FCPJ8N) I actually just added another quarter like this one to the end results, which actually is a conservative estimate of $96B compared to the guidance of $112B, and the growth rate that Amazon’s net sales has seen in the past year, with North America Sales rising by 37%, International by 31% and AWS by 30%.

For the cost of sales, I did pretty much the same, and with cost [margin](https://ibb.co/wcP1Wrj) standing at 75% of net sales for the last quarters I think this is pretty safe to say it will remain mostly the same if not even improve due to bigger revenues from the AWS. I also estimated the full yearly costs by adding another identical quarter, just like for the revenues, so that things stay even.

For the other operating expenses, I also took this from their financials as I expect both [SG&A](https://ibb.co/QN7YWxQ) and [R&D](https://ibb.co/DwmXmsK) expenses to start to normalize a little after the huge spending to ramp up capacity this year due to the increase in demand, while I also did the same thing for the [Capex](https://ibb.co/f0dSK7B) spending of Amazon, as they have invested massively in the last 12 months to ramp up things.

Meanwhile for the interest [income](https://ibb.co/rdc1HRZ) and expenses I also just averaged things out for the full year while maintaining the other sources of income, but these have such a small impact that they don’t even matter.

Amazon has had a pretty wild effective [TAX RATE](https://ibb.co/N3vtKJn) in the past decade, but I decided to see what the avg was for the last 4years, and that was 16%, but for safety and due to the change in administration in the US I decided to bump this up a little to 18%.

And one last number that is important is [THE](https://ibb.co/SnQGLXT) earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, which has seen a 36% increase y/y for since 2016.

So, let’s start with the Unleveraged discounted free cash flow [PROJECTIONS](https://ibb.co/89jHggN), though this is not my favorite type of projections we will get to that very soon.

I used the trailing Twelve-month EBITA (which means Earnings before Interest, Tax, Depreciation & Amortization) and assumed a growth starting from of 15% in 2021 and slightly lower each year ending with a 10% growth for EBITA in 2025. EBIT is calculate after subtracting the depreciation and amortization costs from the EBITA for which I implied an annual increase of 10% so it keeps the pace with the EBITA. I used my projection of the effective tax rate of the company of 18%, which is 2% above the last 4 years avg. NWC is the net working capital of the company and it can be summed up in 2 ways, the simpler method is current assets – current liabilities or you can use the more complex formula which I have used which is made up of the total amount of cash & cash equivalents, market investments, trade accounts receivable and inventory from which you subtract the trade accounts payable, so this is the formula I used for this DCF. I also implied the same 10% growth for this, as the company will become even more solvent overtime I estimate. And last but not least I implied a 10% growth for Capital Expenditure as well, which seems pretty reasonable despite this level being very high due to the rapid growth of the company.

Now there are 2 methods of doing the valuation, either the perpetuity method or the EBITDA multiple method, but for this company I think the growth approach is better suited as you will see with my other method, which will show close results to growth approach.

So, this means we have an estimated $584B worth of FCF for a 10% discount rate, which I believe can be even lower for Amazon, but just to be conservative let’s use this 10% rate for the next 5 years. I also assumed the company will continue to grow at a 5% rate after 2025, and that would mean that Amazon will be worth over $3T by 2025, which is mind blowing. So, let’s do the math, with an estimated diluted share count of 531M, that would mean a stock price of $5732 and would imply a return of 83% by 2025. This are insanely huge numbers so let’s take a look at the EBITDA approach also. The nominal value for the EBITDA multiple is usually 25, so, with this multiple, the company would only be worth $3200, that would be only a 2.6% gain from where it is now. If you do want to be conservative you can also do an average of this and the average price would be $4470, with an average return of 43%, which would be pretty much in line with the annual SP500 growth. You can also check and do your own multiple valuation of the company, for example with Amazon right now has been trading at very high EBITDA multiple until recently, so if you use a 50x [multiple](https://ibb.co/VWDxGcg), the actual projections of the stock would be very close, with 71% return for the EBITDA approach and a 77% upside on average, but I think now is the time we move on to my favorite valuation approach, which is not the DCF method.

I like to value companies based on multiples of future price earnings. So, let’s take a look at what Amazon earnings/share will be by 2025.

I implied for the 3 main streams of [revenues](https://ibb.co/KVnYyqC) which are North American Sales, International Sales and AWS sales a rate of growth similar to the one we had this year but with gradual declines each subsequent year. I also used pretty much the same average [cost of sales](https://ibb.co/3sv40Sf) which includes the actual cost of sales and the fulfillment costs. This has stood at about 75% of the net revenues for the past years and might actually improve, but I do want to stay on the safe side. So, by 2025 the gross [REVENUES](https://ibb.co/xSdQX9P) should reach around $244B, assuming margins stay pretty much in line, though it’s likely they will improve margins, with International sales becoming a little more profitable and AWS brining more & more money.

We also have to estimated what the Capex & Operating [expenses](https://ibb.co/HHM0PfS) would be by 2025. I think Amazon should see somewhat of a slowdown of Capex, R&D & SG&A spending, as they have seen a huge boost in the past year, and I think it should normalize, so I will imply an 8% annual growth for these, which is still very high.

[Next](https://ibb.co/F75r4jN), we look at the interest income, expense and other losses or incomes for the company. This numbers are small compared to the vast cash flows of the company that they can even be ignored, but let’s assume they see a 10% decrease both in income and expenses related to interest while also not suffering losses but having a smaller other income by 10%/year. This would results in an almost $114B income pre-tax for 2025.

As I showed you earlier, the effective tax rate for Amazon has been around 16% in the past 4 years, despite the nominal US tax rate. For safety reasons I will use an 18% tax rate, though this should stay closers to 16% on the back of the International taxes. So, with an 18% tax rate, the [FINAL](https://ibb.co/d7ZCstY) income for the company after everything has been taken into consideration should be $93.25B.

For the outstanding [shares](https://ibb.co/x33HyxP), I will be conservative and imply a .5% increase in outstanding shares, as the company has been very careful in avoiding the dilution of the stock. So, with that increase by 2025, we should have around 531M shares.

So, [BASED](https://ibb.co/282sK42) on Price to Future Earnings/share we can see Amazon is currently trading at almost 18 times 2025 earnings/share, which compared to the 90 multiple it’s trading right now would be insanely low. I can see Amazon continuing to trade at very high P/E for the foreseeable future. So, with a 25 PE price the company should trade at 4400$, while with a 50 PE ratio, the stock should be close to 9000$/share, which is insane when you think about that number, but maybe Bezos will listen and split the shares finally.

[Compare](https://ibb.co/ChhMP6Z) this to the [DCF](https://ibb.co/1TM7FWd) valuation and you see that the Perpetuity approach is similar to a 35 PE ratio, while the AVG approach is similar to a 25 PE Ratio, which I don’t expect Amazon to trade at, not even in 5 years.

So, after all these estimates what are my price targets? [HERE](https://ibb.co/2d2KPV4) are my actual price targets… I think the bear case 2025 price we can see Amazon trade at is $4828 which would imply a return of over 54%, while my base case and my pretty safe assumption is that Amazon will trade at 6145$/share by the end of 2025, implying a 96.5% return on the [current price](https://ibb.co/FwrMhnY). My most bullish case though is $7900, which would imply a return of 152%, with that number being mind-blowing given the current valuation of the company… but I guess we do have to start getting used with such high numbers… I guess decades ago when we saw the first millionaire or billionaire, people would have also thought that it was crazy… but crazy is for the limited minds only I believe.

So yeah guys, here is my [OVERALL](https://ibb.co/XF5h87q) price targets for 2025, my bear case is an average of the 25 & 30 PE ratio, while the normal case is the average between the 30 and 40 PE’s with the most bullish case valuing the company between a PE of 40-50.

So [HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1O_rAl569qptpB1n1k6hpLLdOroX045_JDHrXLj81-u0/edit) is the full spreadsheet that I have projected for Amazon by 2025, if you do have another opinion or a suggestion please leave a comment down below, I think I have been conservative in most of my projections, but feel free to give your opinion.

Keep in mind, these targets might sound ridiculous, but just look at the growth Amazon has in the past. The company has increased in [value](https://ibb.co/QpDg4mp) by more 450% in just the past 5 years and is over 160.000% up since it started [trading](https://ibb.co/KyDzqWq). So yes, the valuation is mad right now for the company. So, are you willing to bet against one of the biggest and fastest growing companies in the world?

The company also has pristine [FINANCIALS](https://ibb.co/Bgxf91m), with more than $112B in current assets vs only $102B in current liabilities, with over $282B in total assets. So, the company is way more than solvable at any point in the near future.

And let’s also take a look at what the estimates are from the analysts. We can see that the analysts expect a similar [EPS](https://ibb.co/R48nrDF) by 2025, of around $166 compared to $171/shares that my Growth Valuations are projecting. So, it seems that this could be a very reasonable upside for the company.

So, what do I expect in the next couple of days, weeks and months for Amazon?

Let’s look at this [CHART](https://ibb.co/kHwWq4x), so starting with the high the stock made before the September sell-off. The stock has been trading in this wedge formation for the last couple of months with increasingly higher lows. The stock isn’t overbought and hasn’t been since it saw an RSI of 73 when it reached the all-time highs. I think with this wedge formation building up, with increasing higher lows and with the pattern of trading likely being an Elliot Theory 5 [WAVE](https://ibb.co/MBqPyc2) formation, I think it’s very likely we see a breakout in the near future, maybe just before earnings, and I expect this breakout to mimic the last run the stock had of about 23% up. So, with that 23% increase mirrored that would result the stock should peak around $[3900](https://ibb.co/VBpRv6j), which I expect to see by the end of the year.

And let’s take a quick look at what 47 [analysts](https://ibb.co/YT0BPTP) on wall street are saying. They are mostly very bullish on the company with an average price target of $3800 and a high price target of $4600 which is insane for a return in the next 12 months, as 46 of the 47 analysts are either bullish or very bullish on Amazon. So yet again, the $3900 isn’t that out of possibilities even as Wall Street’s analysts expect

So, what would I do? Well, I own Amazon stock and I believe it still has tremendous room to grow, so I would start building a position as I expect the company to resume its uptrend sooner rather than later and the next catalyst may be just a couple of weeks away with the last quarter [earnings](https://ibb.co/nLhCJpk) expected to be announced by the end of January.

And I shouldn’t forget to mention that I believe Amazon is one of the most stable stocks out with very good [leadership](https://ibb.co/7KS3yS6), and with large institutional [holders](https://ibb.co/8Dj1W3C) like Vanguard, BlackRock and Morgan Stanley owning huge amounts of the company.

So, [THIS](https://ibb.co/2d2KPV4) are my projections and my expectations for the company, and if you do want to check out the spreadsheets you can find the link [HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1O_rAl569qptpB1n1k6hpLLdOroX045_JDHrXLj81-u0/)

Q: If I anticipate a sizable capital gain on the sale of an investment during the year, do I need to make a quarterly estimated tax payment during the tax year?

A:

Generally, you must make estimated tax payments for the current tax year if both of the following apply:

You expect to owe at least $1,000 in tax for the current tax year after subtracting your withholding and refundable credits, and

You expect your withholding and refundable credits to be less than the smaller of:

90% of the tax to be shown on your current year's tax return, or

100% of the tax shown on your prior year’s tax return. (Your prior year’s tax return must cover all 12 months.)   _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ CREED IS ONE OF US!!!! _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ To the outter reaches of our solar system. #RetardStrength _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ China’s Nationalist Agenda Behind Its Opening Up to Foreign Banks I am avoiding investing in anything CCP related because our short sightednes is being used against us for our medium - long term destruction - what do you think of this?

&#x200B;

[https://harrisbricken.com/chinalawblog/chinas-nationalist-agenda-behind-its-opening-up-to-foreign-banks/](https://harrisbricken.com/chinalawblog/chinas-nationalist-agenda-behind-its-opening-up-to-foreign-banks/)

 

"In [a recent op-ed](https://www.usnews.com/news/best-countries/articles/2020-10-06/commentary-mulan-disney-and-the-dilemma-of-doing-business-in-china), I wrote how the controversy over Disney’s *Mulan* embodies some of the ethical dilemmas and pitfalls that face companies doing business in China. On one hand, to maintain their presence in China these companies must comply with the demands and expectations of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). On the other hand, doing so comes with the cost of significant reputational risk at home.

But the influence Beijing seeks to gain on Western media companies such as Disney and Comcast is but a subplot in a much larger story, and China is playing a series of bigger games in which its Communist Party is thinking a dozen moves ahead of their chief opponent — the United States. Since China’s path to victory over the United States will depend in large part on our ignorance the what games it plays and the strategies it employs, the U.S. must quickly become privy to both to stand a chance.

Though the strategic game of choice in much of the world is chess, in China it is wei qi. China is employing a comprehensive strategy to encircle us across many domains of competition. The CCP knows it cannot win a kinetic war with the United States and so it is finding other ways to fight the hundred years’ war against the United States. And among those ways is using our short-term thinking, our hunger for market opportunities (aka greed), and our openness against us.

#### 1. China’s Most Dangerous Game

To understand China’s game, it helps to studying their primary tactic at the moment, which involves aggressively opening their financial markets to the U.S. in ways they never have before, and China is doing this despite [tense political relations](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/21/us-china-relations-will-remain-tense-says-former-american-ambassador.html) between the two nations. Just in the last few months, China has given approval to leading Wall Street firms like BlackRock, Vanguard, Citigroup, and JPMorgan Chase, to expand their businesses in China. In August, BlackRock [received official approval](https://www.wsj.com/articles/blackrock-gets-go-ahead-for-a-mutual-fund-business-in-china-11598687419) from the Chinese government to set up a mutual fund business in Shanghai. Days later, Vanguard announced it was moving its [regional headquarters](https://www.ft.com/content/46683cde-9707-4023-9378-52e6491f8817) to Shanghai. JPMorgan Chase, meanwhile, is set to pay $1 billion to become the first foreign company to [assume full ownership](https://www.ft.com/content/f785d18e-e4c8-4b67-85ea-da71e9f8f6f2) of a pre-existing Chinese mutual fund business. This is all in marked contrast to Beijing’s previous requirement that Western firms partner with local Chinese entities to do business in China’s financial markets.

Why is China opening up their financial markets and why now? China is *not* doing this because it needs the money. Part of the reason it is doing this is because it wants to study Western banking models. There are numerous examples of China bringing in Western companies and letting them make money in China but essentially forcing them to teach Chinese companies that are positioning themselves to set up competing enterprises that will eventually destroy the China opportunities for these very same Western companies. When a Western company fights back via the legal system, as the Dallas-based Tang Energy Group has done against the state-owned Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC), they find China to be a formidable opponent even [when fighting on home turf](https://apnews.com/article/055b6cebe41649999d48fa1b5265fb19).

If you study China’s past collaborations with the West in other industries—its partnerships with Disney and Comcast being notable examples—a pattern comes into focus. Essentially, what Beijing is doing is laying down the foundations for an ecosystem set up to extract commitments and support for their policies from Western companies. This ecosystem consists of numerous interlinking components, including the [social credit ranking system](https://harrisbricken.com/chinalawblog/chinas-new-company-tracking-system-comply-comply-comply/), the national security law, and [cybersecurity laws](https://harrisbricken.com/chinalawblog/china-cybersecurity-no-place-to-hide/). With these components now in place, the CCP is inviting into China an increasing number of Western companies from varying industries, most of which will not be able to resist the prospect of tapping into what is now the world’s largest economy.

For its part, the CCP is not interested in providing access to its markets without getting something in return and what it wants most of all, is for foreign financial institutions to favorably represent and support their nationalist narratives and policies back home in the United States. U.S. banks and financial companies are the perfect vehicle for Beijing to achieve these aims since the financial sector has tremendous lobbying power in Washington and is by far the largest source of [campaign donations](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-banks-lobbying/banks-spent-record-amounts-on-lobbying-in-recent-election-idUSKBN16F26P) to political parties and candidates.

This is not just an abstract hypothetical. China has already done this, very recently in fact with Standard Chartered and HSBC, two British banks with operations in Hong Kong and the mainland. Beijing gave the ultimatum to these two British banks that if they did not publicly express support for the [national security law](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-52765838) in Hong Kong they would lose the right to continue doing business in China. Both [banks complied](https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/04/business/hsbc-standard-chartered-hong-kong-law-intl-hnk/index.html) in a move [widely criticized by](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hongkong-protests-hsbc-hldg-stanchart/hsbc-stanchart-criticised-for-backing-hong-kong-security-law-idUSKBN23B0FD) the international community. But the CCP didn’t stop there; it also demanded both companies crack down on clients with ties to the pro-democracy movement in Hong Kong. The banks [complied with this](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hongkong-security-wealth-exclusive/exclusive-global-banks-scrutinize-their-hong-kong-clients-for-pro-democracy-ties-idUSKCN24L096) as well.

Another more recent example is the CCP abruptly [slamming the brakes](https://www.wsj.com/articles/ant-founder-jack-ma-faces-backlash-from-regulators-11604442018) on Ant Group’s highly anticipated IPO, just days before its shares were set to begin trading in Shanghai and Hong Kong on Nov. 5, costing the company tens of billions of dollars. This came just over one week after Ant Group co-founder Jack Ma criticized Chinese regulators for stifling innovation with a “pawnshop mentality.” The CCP shut down this IPO and then [disappeared Jack Ma](https://www.ft.com/content/751c2500-f50d-47c9-8f04-a28ad62285fd) as retaliation and as a reminder that the CCP controls all private industry in China. Duly chastened, Ant Group publicly pledged to [“embrace regulation](https://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/3108145/ant-group-executives-meet-chinese-regulators-days-trading-debut)“, but Jack Ma has not been seen nor heard from for going on a month now.

These are tactics China has been before and will use again with the foreign banks and financial institutions rushing in now.

#### 2. Why Companies Comply With China’s Demands

Why do Western companies not just refuse to comply when China makes these kinds of demands? Why would they support policies that so clearly run counter to the democratic principles of their home countries?

First, as part of the contractual conditions for doing business in China, the Communist Party requires foreign companies to not say or do anything disruptive to the stability of China’s social fabric. What is considered “disruptive,” however, is deliberately left ambiguous and open to the CCP’s arbitrary interpretations. Companies that violate this rule may not only lose their right to operate in China, they may also be required to forfeit the intellectual property they brought with them. To illustrate, if the CCP were to disapprove of something Disney said, Disney might not only be forbidden to release any future films in China, their highly profitable Shanghai Disneyland and other joint ventures would thereafter belong entirely to their government-owned Chinese business partners. This is likely why Disney has been [slow to answer](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-disney-mulan-china/u-s-lawmakers-quiz-disney-ceo-over-xinjiang-connection-to-mulan-idUSKBN2630AZ) questions from U.S. or U.K. lawmakers about their involvement with Xinjiang, or answered those questions in only the vaguest terms. They do not wish to provoke CCP ire.

Of course, Western companies could always just say “no” to the CCP’s demands, or they could conclusively prove their commitment to their home countries and democratic principles by being willing to sever their ties with China. The reason they do not do this is simple: once these companies have invested resources to establish their presence in China, and particularly once they are generating profits in China, they have too much to lose.

But why would Western firms agree to such contractual terms in the first place? For the same reasons they comply when the CCP makes its demands: money. The prospect of tapping into the world’s largest economy is too enticing for companies to pass up. Perhaps corporate America’s proclivity to focus on short-term profits blinds companies to the very real risks of making deals with China. Or perhaps they do not believe China would actually try to manipulate them in such a way (though it is clear from the examples of Standard Chartered and HSBC that China [very much would](https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/04/business/hsbc-standard-chartered-hong-kong-law-intl-hnk/index.html)). These companies also may ultimately be agnostic about the countries and the principles to which they are loyal. But for whatever permutation of reasons, foreign banks right now are happily walking into the honeytrap the CCP has set for them. Insidious as all of this is, one cannot help but marvel at the strategic genius of using our own short-term thinking against us. As I often say, China looks miles down the road; we look inches down the road.  

#### 3. Why This Matters for the American People

From tech to fashion to the media, Western industries are becoming increasingly complicit in China’s manifold [human rights violations](https://www.amnesty.org/en/countries/asia-and-the-pacific/china/report-china/). I fear banks soon will be as well, but there are two bases for cautious optimism. One is the bipartisan support in Washington for sanctions against China for its human rights abuses. If enough political momentum can be built before China exercises its influence over American banks and their lobbying power, this could prevent serious problems down the road. However, there would need to be an international effort on this because the U.S. cannot deter China alone. Though the Republicans have sought to frame Joe Biden as being China’s choice, the reality is that Biden is not only a China hawk, he also has the diplomatic dexterity to bring world leaders back to the U.S.’s side for a concerted effort.

The other source of hope lies with U.S. citizens becoming increasingly aware of China’s game plan and articulating their concerns through their purchasing patterns. The banks need to understand that we know they have choices in this matter, and that the best choices would be those that are loyal to U.S. interests. Activist-led movements like the recent call to [boycott Disney’s ](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2020/09/05/mulan-disney-china-hongkong-boycott/)[*Mulan*](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2020/09/05/mulan-disney-china-hongkong-boycott/) raise the likelihood that Americans will become more concerned about these issues. The challenge here is that the Covid-19 pandemic and ensuing economic crisis in America have created an atmosphere of self-preservation, and this has emboldened China to push harder and faster to take their plan to the next stage.

We the people can and should become more active players by bringing China’s nationalist agenda to the center of the national discussion — not at the expense of the other issues we care so deeply about—the economy, the coronavirus, the preservation of democracy — but precisely in the name of them.

It's been even more fun the past two days racking up high scores on my account.  And I am so happy for DFV I could piss rainbows.

But (and this is going to be unpopluar)...

Just because we seem to be on top right now does not mean we actually are.  Almost all of us, myself included, got our DD from DFV and a couple of the other OG GME Gang, thought it made sense, and had the balls to back up their analysis with our money.  I don't know about you, but I sure as hell didn't plow through two years of 10-Ks to make my decision.  They found the chink in the armor, and we have been exploiting the fuck out of it the last couple of months.

I don't care what Cramer says: we don't control the market.  He's blowing smoke up our collective ass so we'll watch his show, and so the people who \*do\* control the market watch his show and get angry.  We don't even come close to controlling the market.  All I see us doing is pointing out that the analysts at Melvin and BoA have been lazy, and people there are gonna get fired over this.  The ones that are left will adapt, and they have much deeper pockets than we do.  And all the memeing, all the dancing-in-the-end-zone posts, all the declarations of "I AM THE CAPTAIN NOW" will not change that fact.  And seeing the rash of "HERE'S THE NEXT SHORT SQUEEZE OPPORTUNITY" posts should be a warning bell for everyone.

We are catching lightning in a bottle with GameStop.  This is a once-in-a-lifetime play, with a perfect storm of a severely undervalued company, an incorrect narrative about its balance sheet, really poor analysis regarding its viability, and a couple of high-profile investors who saw what DFV was seeing a year ago.  Ryan Cohen has played this perfectly since he got to 12% ownership; how many of you are willing to bet that the next bozo to buy a large minority position in an undervalued company won't do what Eddie Lampert did to Sears: tear the thing apart, sell its components off, and fuck the customers and stockholders?

**TL;DR:** Be careful, be humble, enjoy your tendies. Don't expect this to happen all of the time, and for Ghu's sake, don't believe the press.  Their narrative is not your reality.

Score Media, aka one of the most popular and used sports news app in North America, located in Toronto. As some of you might know already, US government is legalizing online sports bets in hopes to cover Covid loss. Canada is few steps away from passing the law as well. 

The stock is at $2.73 right now. It was $0.67 about 2 months ago. I think this is undervalued as fuk especially if Canada passes the law (very high chance looking at our covid loss). And with support of Rogers, one of the biggest monopoly, it literally cannot go tits up. Canadians will go in blindfolded either it's sht or not, just like Tim Hortons. The competitors sit around $30\~55. If SCR gets in the game, which I think is very probable with such a huge community base, this sht will rocket like a motherfuker in the upcoming months if the law passes.

The betting system is already in the app, they're just waiting for the gov to pass the law to roll it in.

We all saw that gap up to $41.50 dollars from $36.92 in about 20 minutes. GME wanted to go a lot higher yesterday but the shorts used all of their firepower to keep it down, and they couldn’t even keep it below $39 at end of day. Profit taking also contributed to the drops throughout the day probably, but don’t take profits now, Jesus does this even need to be said. Do you want to be walking around in 3 months and see some guy in a Ferrari with a license plate that reads GME or do you want to be that guy.

So why are the shorts on the ropes, I went through why the shorts didn’t cover much volume during the 13/01 in my previous post and it is the same story yesterday. There was a general balance between buy and sell orders throughout the day (14/01) and there was less volume than the day before, THERE IS NO WAY THE SHORTS HAVE COVERED BUT THEY HAVE SHORTED MORE in the last couple of days.

Here are some details, link 1 below shows that the short volume is stills currently 137.51% of the float. We can have a lot of fun with that. [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kxhqo5/gme\_when\_evaluating\_potential\_for\_further\_short/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kxhqo5/gme_when_evaluating_potential_for_further_short/)

Secondly, the short borrow fee at the moment is 45.26%, the highest it has ever been. I get better rates when I borrow money from my friendly local loan shark to yolo weeklies with. This means that there are very little shares left to borrow, we were down to 400’000 shares left to borrow at close yesterday and shorts are still borrowing shares to keep the price down. This is demonstrated by the 17 million in short volume on 14/01, in addition to 46 million on 13/01. Just opening these positions is killing the shorts, but they are doing it to keep the price down. All of this can be seen here: [https://fintel.io/ss/us/gme](https://fintel.io/ss/us/gme)

Summary: Do not sell, tell your friends, parents, distant relatives, priests, drug dealers and doctors to buy more shares in this shit. The price action since the start of the week is just a correction to FAIR VALUE, this isn’t an inflated price at all. And it has corrected to that despite shorts pulling every trick in the book. This rocket is only lifting off.

Don't worry my fellow degenerates here's your next consideration

**AES, a power generation and utility company with majority operations located in US with the rest located in South America.**

Now I'm not going to post here a shit ton of charts that none of you actually read or believe in (someone showed me that drawing a fucking FORK on a chart will tell me I'm about to make bank). Instead what I will say is that this company has slowly, *slowly* been gaining traction in terms of price & volume for the past several weeks.

# At a glance

1. 34 plants (53% solar, 36% wind and 11% energy) that all are currently operating under AES
2. 20 plants under construction (\~25% split as above but now includes hydrogen)
3. Net income YoY decreased from +598m to a loss of -249m supposedly because of regulated rates during the COVID pandemic.
4. Massive focus of dropping coal & other boomer energy
5. Turns a profit every other quarter/year.
6. 1.5 billion in cash & equivalents

# What are the risk factors?

For me I don't really fuck with making up shit and I rely on Grand-daddy Graham to guide me to make sure that I don't blow up the account and end up posting loss porn for 34 karma. So here are the risk factors that I don't like about this company:

1. Total assets only slightly exceeds total liabilities you at least want to keep a 2:1 ratio 
2. No consistency in profits
3. I'm not a fucking energy expert. My field is Retail, Supply Chain, eCommerce.

# What's my play?

This is a company that shows positive and good gains one quarter and then shows losses the next quarter. Hence it's my belief on why it hasn't gained any traction. However, lately there has been a huge emphasis by AES on transforming the company into going **full** renewable for the US.

What does this mean?

Institutions will take an interest and begin making their plays. We will be seeing investments from institutions all wanting a piece of the pie when they saw PLUG shatter all logic. As a comparison PLUG had on avg of \~100m losses every year in the previous 3 years and their valuation sky-fucking-rocketed. 

So why in the world would AES, a company that actually generates profit and has cash equivalents of 1.5b laying around not go in the same trajectory?

Even without the institutional investing they have enough talent in exec force to understand simple finances in order to begin turning consistent profits.

Been going balls deep studying this bad boy. They got their fame from making Gopro chips. Now they have Computer Vision Artificial Intelligence. It’s a program built-in to hardware that ANY camera manufacturer can use in their cameras to add intelligent vision and identification to their cameras.

Buncha videos of their shit. See it progress from 2013…

[https://www.ambarella.com/applications/automotive/](https://www.ambarella.com/applications/automotive/)

They make the hardware, (chips), that manufacturers put in their cameras to auto detect things. Cars, people, traffic signals, etc.

They just released a 5nm ARM chip that processes 8k.

[https://3vpstm1hc6e52739x31131p2-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/Ambarella\_CV5\_Product\_Brief\_11JAN2021.pdf](https://3vpstm1hc6e52739x31131p2-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/Ambarella_CV5_Product_Brief_11JAN2021.pdf)

Who cares, no one uses 8k. Well… 8k is (4) 4k video streams simultaneously. This means the cameras on a car, front, back, left, right, can all be processed at the same time, on one chip WITH AMBA’s CV flow AI technology.

They also can be used in security and industrial platforms for tracking and recognizing people and manufacturing processes. Every traffic camera, body camera, home security camera, will have a chip similar to AMBA’s.

Amazon selected them along with NVDA to provide chips for 360\* cameras.

The share price is $108. It was $94 couple weeks ago. Market cap is still around $4billion, and they are winning contracts for AMZN, with NVDA.

Auto drive cars will have to use redundant safety platforms such as LIDAR, Computer vision cameras, radio imaging, infrared, etc.

I used finviz for percentages and ycharts for shares outstanding cause it was higher.

Total Shares Outstanding - 35,170.000

Institutional Owned -  -27,045,730

Insider Owned - -1,652,990

Short Float -  -2,437,281

Equals - 4,033,999 shares left on open market for us to rape

This is the monthly Chart that convinced me. The CCI explosion and lack of RSI movement says room to run.

Hardly any options activity to hold price down. Fuckin’ real tired of being poor. Gopro hype took this to $130/share. This tech is bout to explode and this bitch gonna run to $240.

3. Those who never understood PLTR, will understand that its seriously undervalued after demo day. Stock pumps.
4. Retards start to realize that PLTR had a DPO and not an IPO. They realize Palantir wants retail investors to price the stock instead of institutional investors pricing it for us, and then we buying in. Stock pumps.
5. Specifically for tomorrow - Retards who missed the GME train are pumping PLTR anyway. No DD required. Stock pumps again!
6. There is an anonymous network called Team Blind. Filled with Software engineers with crazy TC's. Every person on the network is identified by a unique identifier \*username - companyname\*. All of these are verified users. Reading responses from Palantir engineers will give you an idea where they price the stock.

Then look no further! This is my first DD - so be patient because I suck at explaining shit.. 

Apparently this is well known amongst people in the field already but not as much outside, but the FCC requires for you to get licensing for you to use certain frequency for X amount of time/period. These requests are public and are available for view at https://apps.fcc.gov/oetcf/els/reports/GenericSearch.cfm

Once you're there, do a generic search and in the application bar put 'Virgin Galactic'. From there you can see their current request pending approval, their previous requests that were granted approval and also the time frame from which they are requesting the most recent license for.

My original PT was 33-35 leading upto their launch  but since Cathie helped us out and put the word out with ARKX - it closed AH at 33. So it's pretty likely it'll beat it's ATH from Feb 2020. 

Tldr: SPCE 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ The BBBY Short Squeeze (Little Sister of All Short Squeezes) **TLDR**: BBBY Rocket Ship Emoji, Calls (3/19 25-35cs) and Shares

First, I like to reiterate my own retarded investing tenets to make sure any plays I make align with it: 

Overall:

1. I'm a retard and don't know anything.

Bull Market specific tenets (if you're a gay bear move on):

1. The market is undervalued, and 

2. Small businesses are getting crushed by governments to the benefit of big business, due to COVID.

What's that mean? Sure, stocks may be overvalued, but the entire market is UNDERvalued, so your own internal stock valuations don't mean shit. Ask yourself, "where the fuck else would I put my money?" If you put it in a bank, printer goes BRRRR and you lose value. The only option is real assets: equities, real estate, and then to a lesser extent guns/ammo/food.

So this play, a boomer ass retail chain, sounds dumb as hell when I say it. That means it MUST be good. It's a big business, which our government is bending over backwards to give free money to. Big stores have cash on hand, which smaller businesses it competes with don't. It has an online presence. Online presence sounds useless, except COVID is forcing the move to online quicker than even the most skilled executive could pivot those old store-based retail ships. And COVID/WFH means they get to drop their unprofitable stores, employee benefits, and dead weight faster without any blow back from consumers.

All of this is even BEFORE I look at [BBBY specifically](https://bedbathandbeyond.gcs-web.com/financial-information/sec-filings). Let's get into it:

* BBBY has cash on hand, $1.5B to be exact (+$0.5B since COVID began. See? What did I say?)

* They grew online sales by 77%, with over a third of them through in store deliveries (aka, customers in stores. If you're tarded, that means good).

* Margins are going up +3.1% (another side effect of COVID, less costs). They also STARTED to cut and streamline their inventory which hasn't even fully been taken into effect yet, since it takes months if not years to liquidate their old junk, but the costs are coming down there.

* Most importantly, the people. They hired Target exec Mark Tritton as their CEO and he's been doing really well pivoting them online, just like he did with Target (What do you think of when you think of Amazon competitors? Wal Mart and Target). He also brought a ton of improved private brands to BBBY, and if you're a retard like me, private brands = margin (that means money).  Sure, he's not Ryan Cohen, but [he's no slouch](https://www.retaildive.com/news/one-year-in-mark-trittons-turnaround-at-bed-bath-beyond/587680/).

Finally, this is one of the highest shortest stocks on the market, at [61.2%](https://www.highshortinterest.com/) and INCREASING.

So let's recap so far:

* New Exec with a proven track record.

* An actual profitable business and online presence.

* Tailwinds (gov and economic) pushing them to profitability (not even including their smaller inventory + private brands growth).

* Shorted out the ass.

Sound like GME? Nope, it's BBBY. It's not going to be like GME's almost infinity squeeze (praise be to DFV), but it could be the LITTLE SISTER OF ALL SHORT SQUEEZES.

This is the first real threat to  ENPH  and SEDG's duopoly (and their subsequent absurd x30-x200 rise in  the  last 2 years). BUY ENPH or SEDG PUTS/SHORTS asap.**

Ok retards, I've been following the solar space for some time and I just had to write something before others do.

**Background - The reason behind SolarEdge and Enphase's meteoric rise.**

As   you can see in the charts below, ENPH and SEDG have rallied like crazy   the last couple of years. ENPH especially... it went from under $1 to   $208 as of today. Although ENPH was sort of a turnaround story, the  real  reason behind their rise was due to regulation (NEC 2017) that  required  rapid shutdown devices on solar systems in the US. This  basically  killed chinese and other inverter manufacturers in the US  that didn't  have module level hardware. Long story short, it created a  beautiful  duopoly in the residential solar market in the US during a  rapid growth  in the industry.

&#x200B;

**Current Valuations of SEDG & ENPH**

I'm   not going to get into the financials etc, but SEDGs P/E is 99 and   ENPH's is 163. Enough said. Of course the whole sector has rallied with   DEM win and recently with the senate upset. Fine. But this rise, like   EV's, is frothy as hell.

Having  said that, I wouldn't typically recommend anyone short or buy puts on any of the  solar names (RUN, JKS, CSIQ, DQ, SEDG, ENPH, TAN, ICLN, etc etc).   They were overvalued 3 months ago. They can keep going up up and up. As  a  lot of people have been posting here recently, the clean energy ETFs   have done incredibly well. HOWEVER with ENPH & SEDG's.....

**Besides like Apple or Amazon, what's the WORST company to suddenly become your competitor...?**

TESLA obviously. Elon Musk is the only guy that keeps bald nerd-turned-into Vin diesel looking mfer Bezos awake at night.

With   big dog Tesla entering the space, and becoming a DIRECT COMPETITOR out   of nowhere to ENPH and SEDG, this changes things. For those invested  in  any of the solar names, it's time to hedge by buying some ENPH/SEDG   puts. For any degenerates looking for a quick buck, ENPH and SEDG will   most certainly start coming down to reasonable valuations. You heard it   here first, this is the END OF THE DUOPOLY. Once chinese manufacturers   get back into this space, then it'll get commodified like the solar   panel guys (hello <10 P/Es).

**PS: TAN and ICLN's biggest holdings are SEDG & ENPH...**

Happy   Hunting Retards. For ENPH Longs... Please don't give me shit about  "but enphase has micro-inverters, they are better than central inverter  blah  blah blah". Don't be like the sleazy solar sales guys that knock  doors  in Long Island every week. Customers don't care if its micro vs.   string inverters. They care about price and brand recognition. From   Electrek *"Finally, the greatest   advantage (although it’s uncertain) is potentially the cost. Tesla could   potentially be able to achieve a better cost than the competition by   leveraging its already large power electronic production capacity for   its electric vehicles and charging stations."* Price will certainly  be lower than ENPH or SEDG. You think anyone knows wtf enphase or  solaredge is? They all know what Tesla is, they have one parked in your  mom's house._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ GME To the Moon Benito _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Kia mentioning technology partnership with Canoo (GOEV) _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Don’t overlook Affirm (AFRM) IPOed yesterday at $90 after pre-ipo price of $49. Went as high as $130, finished after hours at $118. 

They essentially offer payments over time, many times with 0% interest and varying lengths up to the consumer. It’s up to the company to buy down interest rates from affirm if they want to incentivize consumers. Affirm gets revenue share from company, and then collects payments from consumer. Affirm drives huger average price of sale with payment over time capability so companies are jumping on board. 

They’re small right now and are taking flak for being smaller than an Australian equivalent, but who cares about that in early stages mate? They are also getting talked down as their last quarter results included 30% of revenue from their biggest partner-to-date at that time, Peloton. 

That would all be valid, and lots of ipo prices make my face hurt(poshmark, the Goodwill/Craigslist startup @$102), but these guys are going to scream with the background acceleration to online sales as they move this product that has long been needed into the market. Apple started offering affirm on its products in the last 6 months. Think about a future where all big ticket items(whether it’s your iPhone or your Tesla) are processed this way. 

You like square in the past year. You like Shopify. You like ARKF. 

Affirm has and *exclusive* payment processing agreement signed with Shopify. It cost them an 8% stake. If you think shop is going to dominate small and medium-sized commerce in the coming years, you have to see the exponential growth Affirm will undergo. 65% of purchases on affirm are repeat buyers. At early stage this means they are still growing merchant base, and they are successful with the ones they have launched in.

1.) the ARKX announcement is huge 
Cathie fucking Wood is going hard into spaceflight and hypersonics, others will follow. 

2.) look at the names on this, Richard Branson, Michael Colgaizer, Chamath Pahlihapytia,
And did I mention Cathie fucking Wood already.

3.) they already failed their test flight in December. They know what went wrong they are fixing it, this next flight is practically guaranteed to work (I’m an engineer I must be right)

4.) massive huge bigly short interest, literally one of the most shorted stocks behind GameStop , cathie already started the pump, from 27 to 32 this week. The squeeze approaches.

5.) Jeff Bezos rocket company blue origin just announced today they are nearly ready for human sub orbital flights, probably by April. People see Jeff the Amazon king doing it and want in, but blue origin is private, so they’re going to look at Virgin stock instead and dive into that.

6.) timing— all this shit is about to collide in the next couple weeks. The Virgin Galactic test flight dates are coming probably next week. And I’m betting it happens early Feb before their earnings call on feb 25th. If successful I bet they release the Branson flight date during that call.

Conclusion. This bad boy pumps to 55$

In most areas retail stores had to shutdown during this pandemic. Michaels is the biggest arts, craft, framing, and building retailers in the US, which is why **they remained open** during the coronavirus pandemic and mostly kept their **essential** **business** status. This company has probably had its best year in 30 years with all the people stuck at home looking for things to do and crafts to make. Think about all the parents and kids sitting around making memories and school projects with crafts. 

New CEO, new website design, new forward thinking executives and a push to bring this old school ladies stock into this new tech infused world. I wouldn't be surprised if they became a tech company as we will begin to see more and more brick and mortar either move to digitize or get left in the crusty dust.

I see this stock continuing to boom thru earnings in March and start competing with Etsy and Pinterest. They have the supply chain, physical footprint, brand recognition of Gamestop. Ask anyone who deals with schools, crafts, art projects, or any holiday decorations and they will know and think of Michaels.

Disney partnership with Ubisoft to make Star Wars games; fans were extremely disappointed with EA and their shitty battlefronts. This means Disney wants to expands their presence even more on the Video Game Industry. Just wait till they start making more game for their multiple franchises. Fucking Mickey Mouse, Toy Story, Marvel and every other game they can make.

^^^^ They started this trend by partnering with Fortnite, you know where kids waste their parents credit card on useless skins?

Started at $1400->$10k->$33k->$2k and now to here. GME brought me back from wipeout. 🚀🚀🤙 _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ GME Tendies _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Tomorrow’s best play. Of course it’s $PLTR, it’s always $PLTR.

Why? Well, because there’s a special someone with the Midas touch; Cathie Wood. Anything this woman touches turns to gold, as if $PLTR wasn’t already. Not only has ARK been consistently purchasing $PLTR since it’s DPO but just yesterday she happened to purchase another 500,000 shares. Why would someone do that for an analyst rated stock at $15? That’s because Citigroup is one of the lowest institutional shareholders on the board. Yet they never sold any of their shares even after the valuation they gave? That’s what you call legal market manipulation, and if you didn’t know they were trying to get a lower buy in. However, Cathie has once again saved us all.

Here’s the play: Theres a huge amount of short puts expiring tomorrow 1/15, and now every single one of those puts are OTM and will expire worthless. This is the best opportunity to double down on all shares if you don’t already own, I definitely recommend getting in now. If everyone is on board with the same mindset, this is the 2021 shit show I had mentioned in my previous post. Tomorrow is the day, and I promise that even on a 10%+ premarket for PLTR, it is still a great buy. I say this because half the people in my last post were comments about “Am I too late to get in?” No, you’re not. You just had a better opportunity to make even more, except there’s still more to be made. Inaugural rocketship 🚀.

Here’s a little more in depth about reasons to buy PLTR in the most simplest form because I know how retarded some of you are.

1: PLTR DPO’d, not IPO’d. What the fuck does that mean? It means it gave every single one of us a chance to buy the stock at an extremely low price because institutional investors didn’t get the chance to bid the stock price up like with a traditional IPO. Think of DoorDash or AirBnB, two IPO’s that debuted at an absurdly high price. That’s normal for IPO’s, which is what happened with one of PLTR’s competitors, $SNOW. Go look at their current price and do the math, similar company with a fraction of the amount of contracts that PLTR has but has a higher stock price. DPO’s are something Institutional Investors hate, because retail investors (us) get to make the money instead of them, which is why they downgrade the stock in order to get lower buy-ins.

2: Cathie Wood. Like I said earlier, she has the Midas touch. She will literally carry us to the moon if it’s the last thing she does, and this is just the beginning.

3: HUGE presentation on 1/26, that’s literally 12 days away. This presentation will showcase PLTR’s tech and give a better representation of what they really do since people don’t seem to know. (They’re the TOP of data collection, surveillance, etc. and have been doing this for 17 years.) Not only that but this presentation will have earning reports, which we all know are way above the predicted numbers.

4. Tons of contracts already signed, and continually adding more almost weekly. They even have deals with the US Army. Are you fucking kidding me?

5. Lockup. Now you’d think that lockup means that PLTR stock will go down, which is possible and doesn’t matter because the short squeeze happens before the lockup ends either way. BUT this is more than just a squeeze, because lockup doesn’t mean that the price will necessarily go down. It’ll undoubtedly go up even more before this because insiders want to capitalize on as much money as possible when they’re allowed to sell their shares again. No one wants to sell at $25 when they can double that. Another reason why lockup CAN be a good thing is because it allows institutional investors to get back into the stock, with a much higher volume surfacing it gives them the chance to purchase FAT amounts of shares rather than minimal amounts like currently. There’s only 20% of shares floating right now, and retail investors own 60% of that 20%, so institutions can’t really buy anything right now. Which is why it’s been sideways for so long. 

TL;DR: PLTR is going to rocket like crazy the next week or two, tomorrow is the beat day to perform a huge squeeze and fuck shorts over since Cathie Wood has just purchased 500k shares even after a downgrade by analysts. I really recommend you read this post, I’ve dumbed it down quite a lot.

POS: I’m now at 700 shares @25.52, never sold my calls that expire tomorrow because I had faith even though they were down 70%, but are already passed BEP in after-hours. Will be up huge tomorrow. 1/15 26c, 1/15 27c, 1/22 25.5c, 1/22 28c.

EDIT: PLEASE just buy shares, calls are extremely high theta with PLTR and are painful to watch. Shares and hold.

Edit2: 🚀🚀_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $BB TO PLUTO 💎CONNECT THE DOTS🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ When my wife asks me what I do all day on WSB _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ The argument against Intel's (INTL) new CEO [AMD] First off, full disclosure, I'm long AMD and frankly these last two days of AMD getting beat down over Pat Gelsinger, former VMware CEO and now soon to be Intel CEO has got me riled up. 

So, a month ago, activist investors tell Intel they need to shake things up around the office because AMD is absolutely beating them to a pulp. And now here we are, an announcement that current Intel CEO Bob Swan is stepping down and VMware CEO will take over. 

An analyst downgraded AMD over this move. Let me repeat that, an analyst downgraded AMD over Pat fucking Gelsinger. 

In 2012 Pat took over as VMware CEO. Generally,  VMware traded sideways from 2012 to 2016, then saw a 50% drop. That's 4 years under Pat's leadership where there was no growth. 2016-19 were the best years for Pat, if you look at them in isolation. In 2016, VMware experienced a 50% drop in valuation, then rose from $50 to $200 in that time (400%). Pat took over when VMware was trading at $80-90 in 2012, and the stock currently trades at $135, only ~50% growth in 9 years. Over the past 3 years, VMware is actually down. 

When we compare what Lisa Su has done for AMD to what Pat did for VMware....there is just no comparison here. AMD over the past 3 years has increased 900%. If anything, Pat might make things worse at Intel. 

The analyst logic for the downgrade:  "missteps by Intel led to a Blue Sky opportunity for AMD." You know what? The sky is still Blue for AMD.

Diamond Hands!!! _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ How I feel after ARK bought 500K shares of PLTR 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Is it too late to get in on some $BBBY tendies? I think not! **TL:DR:** Get in, loser. We're riding this baby to Uranus. short positions most likely increased after "shit" earnings that were not bad at all. we've only seen the beginning of the squeeze as Technicals look unsustainable long term but primed for a rally short term, share buyback working in tandem with Cramer pumping the stock creates a bloodbath for gay bears. Buying stock is best just like GME because you wanna move that ticker baby. Calls for ballsy tendies

&#x200B;

This week has been **great** for bulls. First GME came through for us and fucked over Melvin and the rest of the boomers leaving us with all these sweet tendies to pick up off the ground and BBBY has EXPLODEDDD this week following a bad earnings call that led to a huge sell off and retreat to **$17** from **over $21**. But was the earnings call really as bad as everyone thought it was? Is the price movement just a result of a short squeeze that is already over?

I think not

1. earnings were **not** as bad as people acted they were, you bet your ass bears tried to short this shit in reaction to the supposed negative numbers while over looking these : **69% increase in digital sales, 150 million share buyback program to complete by end of Feb, continually trimming debt, pivoting to curbside/delivery/digital sales programs and increasing the value of coupons through membership programs to promote brand loyalty** (think Amazon Prime free shipping), **RECCURING REVENUE BUNDLE ( THIS SHIT IS CRACK FOR YOY GROWTH, think AMZN, NFLX, and even NIO now)**

2. **76 million shares in short interest out of 114 free floating.** this is self explanatory after GME but whats interesting is these numbers are from a December 31st settlement. This absolutely grew over the earnings on the 7th. making this potential for profit even more likely. our favorite boomer, Cramer, also pumped the fuck outta this stock on Mad Money TWICE recently stating the short interest is an attempt by bears to capture the stock despite strong promise from within the company.

3. **Active war between bulls and bears...and the bulls are winning.**

1. **TA looks incredibly solid.** Riding the RSI at 70 all day baby. MACD Signal line cross was never destructive, consolidates around support levels, then built up a climb over time, challenging areas of support and bouncing off of them to new highs and lower lows. Trending above 50 day MA, 25 day EMA, and using 10 day MA as support, testing multiple times throughout the day and later consolidating alongside it today until AH.

Shoutout to u/scaling_gamer u/Pendigan u/bitman141 who all have great DD of their own that is more fundamentally focused than mine._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ BB DD: 9 Reasons Why BB is 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 from former BB employee Key qualitative strengths why BB is winning cybersecurity. Some stuff from my head, others from presentation at JP Morgan conference. I have been long BB since June 2019, waiting for this pop to happen. I used to work at RIM/BB (10 years ago) - nothing confidential here but I know the security culture well.

1. **Pervasive security culture** that's decades long from history of building the most secure phones, networks, and servers. End to end encryption is not a new thing to BB. It has been a thing since the very very early days. Only in the last few years are other companies starting to talk about it. I worked there 10 years ago and the security culture was insane. It was harder to go into the prototype plant (RIM 8) than airport security. There's a reason why BB sold phones without cameras because we needed them ourselves. If your BB had a camera, you leave it at the door with security.🚀
2. **Strong customer base** of critical infrastructure that cannot fail or get hacked - think nuclear power plants, the International Space Station, and cars driving down the road. All the top G20 governments, all the top 10 global banks. Remember Obama had a cell phone. It was a BlackBerry and was the first device ever to get approved for use by a president. This was 2008 but he wasn't using a fucking iPhone.🚀🚀
3. **Strong enterprise and government sales experience** \- BB has so much experience selling into the enterprise. B2B sales is not easy as any startup would know but they have been able to do so since the first RIM pager, to BlackBerry smartphones, and enterprise servers. Back in the day, BlackBerry was the only phone to work in disasters because they had dedicated networks and servers - BlackBerry Internet Service (BIS) and BlackBerry Enterprise Server (BES). All your traffic gets routed separately from the general public.🚀🚀🚀
4. QNX **security certifications** for defense, government, automotive, medical, industrial.  ISO 26262 ASIL D, 61508 ASIL 3. These come from a fundamental design principles used for QNX and if competitors are to copy, they would have to start from scratch. QNX hypervisor uses microkernel virtualization to compartmentalize critical processes from non-critical ones. So if you have your autonomous driving or steering system controlled by BB software, your music app that gets hacked ain't touching the steering system. Other companies run through the same kernel, meaning that it is easier to hack.🚀🚀🚀🚀
5. Customer **markets are growing massively. Autonomous driving and connected cars** is blowing up. That means automakers need to either build their own or buy secure software platforms. Considering the cost and time, everyone is buying (except maybe Tesla). As more cars are connected, you also attract more hackers and bad actors, which make automakers more likely to buy industry leading platforms like BB. It's a positive feedback loop. And more customers on this same platform mean more and more security because it makes fixed costs (hiring engineers) make more sense. More customers > more secure > more customers > more secure.🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
6. Most cars use multiple chips to run the different systems. One for the infotainment, one for the drive system, one for the dashboard, etc. Increasingly, automakers are consolidating into single, high performance controllers (ECUs). What this means is that point A.4 above is increasingly more relevant, because a single chip needs to be uber secure. **QNX is designed for this. And 19 of the top 25 EVs already use QNX**🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
7. **AWS partnership to create middleware (IVY)** that allows more companies to build applications to use with the QNX platform. You can have all the best tech in the world, but if no one knows how to use it, or no one has easy access to it, it's useless. Well, this solves that problem as software engineers can now build on it much more easily. SWEs are like water and they use the tools with least resistance. This will create an ecosystem that Amazon and BB will push to the OEMs together.🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
8. AWS IVY (the middleware) is OS and **cloud agnostic**. This means that if Amazon is being a shit partner, they can leave and move somewhere else. Obviously this is not ideal and would require some work, but it's not the end of the world. What this means is that Amazon won't be able to hold BB hostage with more fees if this takes off. It's **50/50 partnership with Amazon**. Think of the concept where you are a restaurant and you are getting good sales. The landlord sees that and they raise your rent. Well shit, you just did more work and your profits stay the same.🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
9. **Pivot from hardware to software means subscription revenue.** What this means is that it is going to go on forever and customer has zero leverage until they want to rebuild their software. If you're an OEM and you build a car around this platform, you're paying BB until you redesign the car from the ground up - all the while you are paying BB every, single, fucking month. And if the OEM's contract with BB is running out, well, BB can raise their rates even higher. What is the OEM going to do? Stop producing a car and spin up another platform, redesign another car around that platform, and retool factories to build it? That takes years and billions, so they pony up to BB whatever fee increases they want. This is how AWS makes so much money.🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

&#x200B;

[\\"I imagine a future where SPWR panels are creating a dyson sphere around the sun\\"-Albert Einstein](https://preview.redd.it/tuzg186cneb61.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=74fa8517a8517e1af2588662ec861e5c7c9712ea)

Edit--I'm in this play to the fucking moon bois. My whole portfolio is on 1/22/21 calls, so im putting my money where my mouth is.

**TL/DR for those with reading issues:** SPWR 45 strike 1/22/21, Or, if you're feeling like not being quite as degenerate and reckless as I am, SPWR 45 strike 1/29/21

Today we are all going to have a little fireside chat about SPWR (Sun Power), and the Tendies it will add to your wheelbarrow of money you are making off GME and BB. Lets start with the basics. SPWR is a solar cell and electric storage company.

**1) Overall Market Conditions--And how SPWR is set to benefit**

We all know how Biden is set on America entering a new era of clean energy, and now he has all the tools of government to do so. Biden is going to be pumping tendies into renewable energy, our goal is to pump our tendies into these companies first. With that being said, SPWR creates solar cells (solar panels and home renewable energy systems) that produce up to 360 W of energy, while typical panels only produce 250 to 270 W. SPWR actually has the WORLD RECORD for sunlight to electric conversion efficiency at 24.2 percent, as confirmed by the US department of energy. There is a high probability of this specific company getting subsidized by the Govt.

**2) SPWR is shorted to oblivion.**

We all love sticking shoes in the mouths of all those snuffy, ostentatious, snooty, wall street shorters who look at a company's P/E ratio and think that's all that matters. NOW IS OUR CHANCE TO DESTROY THEM YET AGAIN. SPWR has a short interest of **50.81 PERCENT.** The moment it squeezes, its going to make them have to sell their suits just so they can short the next stock we will collectively moon. Also shorts STILL HAVE NOT COVERED.

3) CHART: SPWR had a thicc line of resistance at 33. The stock got rejected from that key level twice, before just breaking out today to new highs at 36. She held 35's and is looking to make a short squeeze imminently to 40's and possibly higher.

**4) Basic fundamentals for those who give a shit.**

Revenues for SPWR are expected to grow 23.21% this year, and is expected to have an EPS increase of 184.2% for 2021. SPWR also has a history of beating earnings, beating earnings estimates the last 4 quarters.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

In conclusion, lets become scientists and prove the multiverse theory correct by tendie training this stock to a parallel universe.

&#x200B;

Love you all,

Drumboat_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Xiaomi shares fall 10% as U.S. adds smartphone-maker to 'blacklist' _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Why PLTR stock price is gonna skyrocket up... Hey y'all, this is my first DD, so forgive me if I mess something up. I'm gonna explain to y'all why PLTR stock is about to go to the moon. 

First of all, what is Palantir? Palantir is a company that builds digital infrastructure for data-driven operations and decision-making. The software developed is later licensed to companies which then allow them to make data-driven decisions, conduct intricate analysis, and make their operations even more efficient and productive. 

Palantir was founded back in 2003, and they've been working extremely close with agencies and sectors of the US government (examples include security, healthcare, defense, etc.) Palantir is so balls deep in US operations that it's extremely unlikely that any other company besides Palantir is considered for contracts issued by the US government. They're already so established and solid in their industry. 

**So why does this matter?**

PLTR is going to help multiple countries with their software and digital infrastructure to help them track and trace Covid-19 and its variants. They will also be helping countries efficiently issue and distribute the vaccine. PLTR is so established in their sector that no other company will be considered for these valuable contracts. 

Their CEO Alex Karp is also a badass killer CEO who knows what he is doing. This quote from him encapsulates the potential growth PLTR can undergo. 

*"We are the only people solving problems companies won't realize they have until 2030."* \- Alex Karp

Not only this, but the Canadian government also bought 24 mil PLTR shares after their ER. They obviously know that this stock is gonna blow up.

As Palantir grows more and more and expands to more countries (thanks to covid), they will become bigger and bigger and their stock will grow *exponentially*. 

**Buy and hold PLTR shares boys. PLTR is going to the moon  🚀🚀🚀🚀

So we got a company with 2bn revenue at a market cap under 500million. You can read through my past 2 posts about this company in the above links for the numbers and more thorough DD.

If you were paying attention, Dementia Joe just put the words INFRASTRUCTURE RENEWABLES and TRILLIONS all in the same sentence. This company is going to continue pulling in more and more contarcts.

This week alone 2 contract announcements. First is wind for 100mil and the second is probably around 80-120mil for solar. Its contract after contract.

Warrants should do 100-150% still from current prices before they can be called in. Or just buy commons and sit on these for a long time.

The EV hype has caused lots of EV stocks to moon. Whether or not this will continue no one knows and I don’t care. There has recently been a large shortage of semiconductors for cars. As more and more companies start to produce electronic vehicles, and as these stocks get pumped, the demand for these semiconductors will go up. Already, there is a severe shortage in car chips. 

Don’t believe me? You don’t have to.

You see all those? ON semiconductor is not very well known, but makes chips in the USA. Now out of that big chunk of links I sent, read the last three.

The news has been coming out over the past few days, even CNN is carrying a story about it, but the mooning (fortunately for you) hasn’t started yet.

https://edition.cnn.com/2021/01/13/business/global-chip-shortages-carmakers/index.html

The EV companies want to beat out their competition and make cars as fast as they can. But there are no chips to do it. This means they will start to pay absurd prices for these chips, since they are at such a crucial moment for the company. 

You can capitalise on this by buying calls or shares before this large shortage and hidden gem of an industry is uncovered. 

RELEVANT Positions: 
ON Feb 5 $38
ON Feb 19 $38
NIO Call
TSLA put (lotto play)

TLDR: ON semiconductor will moon with the combined might of Large EV chip shortage, and with earnings report coming in, along with institutions hyping it up and pumping it. Get in first before the others do.

But who cares, scared money don’t make money, and the fear is real. Do any of you r-tards remember the good old days of 2019 going to movies? Remember watching broke back mountain on the big screen? What happened to the good old days?

I am debating on hitting the nitro 🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀and likely losing copious amounts of money, because this bad boy is a straight up gamble.

**The Big Short Squeeze**

Michael Burry is analyzing through sheer brain power all of the shorts at GameStop, and how insane Tesla is. Gets laughed at for shorting Tesla and going long on GameStop.

But then GameStop starts going up and this group of traders on social media start building a huge position, founded on complete degeneracy and worship of Amazon rival Ryan Cohen. A YouTube with 100k and a dream posts about gme on his Reddit account u/DeepFuckingValue and people begin worshipping him. Then it happens. GME skyrockets. Major outlets take notice of social media traders and the short ratio. The price shoots up even higher as retail investors fight what they call the “gay bears” or 🌈 🐻. And they trigger the squeeze eventually, realizing millions of dollars entering the hands of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of people.

Most of these plays are already overvalued and unless you’re buying an ETF, there’s a good chance you will pick losers.


But there’s one thing that all of these green companies thirst for. Everything from solar panels to EV’s use it and it’s been manipulated for years. 

**This is your chance to catch the wave before it’s apparent.**

The shortage is real and it will quickly become evident when the paper contracts become null and void. Big banks have known this for a while now and have been stockpiling like mad. 

90% of silver is used in industry and when the demand rises, there will be no silver supply to meet it.


Now you can either hold physical silver like a boomer or you can buy miners that go absolutely parabolic when this hits. New mines take years to establish and with limited supply these companies have no where else to go but the moon. 

Most miners have been on tight margins and are operating at close to break even. 

Here’s the simple math: say the cost to mine silver is $24/oz. The miners turn around and sell the silver to further fund exploration and mining for $25/oz. Thats a profit of 1$/oz. When the demand and shortage hits, silver is going to hit upwards of $50+. The cost to mine will still be $24/oz. this leaves us with a $26 profit.

That is an increase of 2600%.

Now for the positions:

The current best leverage to silver is First Majestic silver. Many claim to be silver miners but no one comes close to first majestic, whose nearly sole focus is silver. The company just announced a dividend and are well on their way to settle a tax dispute with the Mexican government any day now. This thing has no where to go but up.

TLDR: Positions: $AG shares and any options dated 3 months from now. Imagine leverage on leverage because that’s what you’re getting buying contracts on these miners._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Google Trend comparison: GME (🚀) - PLTR - PTON - PRPL Friends

We still have quite long of a runway in retail demand to pour in there. Let's squeeze those shorts!

Since last week, i've been watching out on blackberry, doing some posts/comments here to inform people that it was gonna be a good investment, because i saw a post about $BB comeback and did my research.

&#x200B;

Long story short, im a broke ass retard that is only able to save 240$ a month, due to low wages in my sector, so dont save much and my plan is to buy a house and cut my rent in half.

My savings were 1.3k in a JP Morgan technology fund, in 3 months i got a 15% return, but still not good enough. I knew something big was coming for blackberry, the settlement with Facebook, huge EV marketshare, new phone coming 2021 with OnwardMobility... so i took a fucking 7k loan, going balls deep in blackberry.

Loan proof:  [https://imgur.com/5fzUTch](https://imgur.com/5fzUTch)

&#x200B;

I was holding 1.3k shares about 7.20$ for 1 week, seeing no much movement, BB today at +1% and GME at +20%, expecting to be 60$ a share by tomorrow, seeing the fucking rockets at GME, i decided to sell everything at BB and join the GME FOMO, turning to -$1.244,79 in 5 minutes, i saw $BB at 4% and i asked wtf is going on, something must have happened. Took the loss of 1.2k at GME and instantly bought back at BB, but to get the money lost faster, i margin the fuck out of 3k, since i know margin is no joke and didnt wanted to get greedy, turning it into 15k and ride the BB rocket i almost missed out.

Basically I don’t know whether it’s better if the short interest goes up because that means there could be a further short squeeze or if we want to see the short interest going down because that means the shorts are covering which agrees with our hypothesis that this is a short squeeze causing this crazy upsurge. 

I read somewhere that as old shorts cover, new shorts are just coming in on GME. Can someone confirm from a data source whether this is true or not? And is this likely to mean we will see further squeeze in the future? This could literally be *the* short squeeze of the century happening in front of our eyes.  (cries with my vertical debit spread -_-)

UPDATE: someone posted GME short Interest of the following amounts the last few days. The short interest has gone UP the last few days surprisingly. 

1/11  - 142.59% SI of float
1/12 - 138.16% SI of float
1/13 - 137.73% SI of float
1/14 - 137.51% SI of float

So the short interest isn’t even decreasing! So what’s causing this upsurge in price if it’s not a short squeeze? This makes no sense to me._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Codexis DD  Codexis CDXS

They invent new enzymes through directed evolution (2018 Chemistry Nobel Prize). Pharma companies pay them royalties to use their platform, and when they invent a new enzyme (takes about three days to do a billion years of evolution) they get to share patent rights. A really remarkable business model with high profile pharma companies (Merck, Novartis, etc...) licensing their tech. Don't be fooled by their website, environmentalism is not the point here, just a small fringe benefit.

Fuck the DD though. Basically you can get rich by buying a stock that proves evolution exists. So next time your shitty uncle gets you upset saying evolution isn't real, dry your tears with sweet sweet tendies.

Rocket 🚀 
Moon 🌙 
Squeeze 🙏🏼


We are so dumb, we’re right about this.  If you’ve read anything on this sub, you know we can be irrational.  


If you know anything about investing, you know the markets can be irrational longer than investors can remain solvent.  


Well guys, we’re the most irrational I’ve ever seen.  And we’re friggin good at it.  
*Ain’t no way anyone can out solvent our irrationality*


But if you don’t believe me, here’s some actually talking points:  


GME is Not dipping.  The math just isn’t there.  This is not a normal rally/hype.  It was a momentum thing.  It’s now becoming a squeeze within the next week.  


This doubling in under 48hrs has made all shorts unprofitable.  It doesn’t matter where they entered.  


Short seller’s peak profit happens if a stock goes to $0.  No one expects GME to be at $0 even in the next few years.  But assuming it could a month from now, let’s do the maths. 


Most shorts got in around $15 or less.  That means the most they can make is $15, **IF** GME goes to $0 (it won’t). 


Now any time you borrow anything, you have to pay interest on it, this includes shares.  The current interest rate is 45% (or higher).  The interest is on the price of the current shares, not the price they bought in at.  


This means on a share price of $40, they are paying nearly $0.06 a day to short it.  Doesn’t sound too expensive right? Until you realize that in less than 28 days (if they allow it compound), they will have paid more in interest than they could ever gain, even if GME went to $0 in February. 


Keep in mind, once a short seller realizes it is literally impossible to make money, they just need to time their exit.  Since this is a stampede of short sellers, the best time to exit is right away.  They literally can’t wait 3 weeks, or else they might as well quite a few more dollars a share (from the interest they’re going to accrue).  


Keep in mind, this is all voluntary covering.  There are also tons of accounts out there that will now have to cover due to margin calls and such.  


Keep in mind that 71 million shares are shorted.  That’s more than are technically available.  


Keep in mind that 20% of shares are locked up by Cohen &amp; such, who cannot sell for a few more months.  So that leaves even less shares for the shorts.  


Once most of the shorts cover (within 3 weeks), the price won’t drop overnight.  They have to buy more shares than available and anyone left holding shorts will still be buying.  And by that time, a new base &amp; support level should have been established.

*****


TL;DR: 
50% upside for GME


Shorts have to cover in less than 25 days or they literally will lose more than they could ever gain from shorting.  


45% interest payments on current share price hurts shorts.  


20% of shares are tied up &amp; not able to be sold. 


Shorters need to buy almost 200% of available shares in the next 3 weeks (assuming they want to cap their losses at 100%). 


Not too late to jump in with shares. 


Don’t wait for a dip.
