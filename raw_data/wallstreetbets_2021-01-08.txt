 Purple flurp coming at ya 2021 +$57k p/l to start 2021 What up peeps. This week has been absolutely nuts. Hope everyone else has been long and strong this market. 

Ended up with +$332k trading p/l last year, well above my goal of $300k. Awesome. 

This year I am shooting for $100k a quarter. In assuming not all weeks will be like this one (can’t stage a coup every week), but my long term expectation is for $5-8k a week. 

Working with about a $500k book, Can lever it up to $2-3mm. 

This week was mainly waiting for outsized moves either direction and playing for mean reversion (macro based for like 70% of the p/l). 

Monday -$32k
Tuesday +$54k
Wednesday +$20k
Thursday +$10k
Friday +5k

Total p/l $57k. Goal is $400k this year. 

Check my previous thread AMA for commonly asked questions and answers. 

Good luck this year!

Some of you might recognize my name. I made this post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jdkjvc/carnival_is_free_money_dd_inside/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) back in October, where I made the claim that Carnival Cruise Lines (CCL) would make the jump from $14.02 to $15 within a month and up to $20 by January. 

My DD was absolutely correct, on the backs of a market which has been slowly getting desensitized to COVID and that my belief in vaccines were going to come out sooner than most people predicted. Though I made the estimate that we would have a vaccine prior to the election, I did state that it would be out “before the end of the year” which was correct. 

Despite my DD, which was flawed in certain areas (and other things were included to catch some people who wouldn’t have seriously considered the DD in the first place, which was the CCL boat saving people drowning in the ocean) it was completely correct. The problem with WSB is y’all see things in white and black. Either “it can’t go tits up” or “it can only go tits up.” You measure your gains in losses by the thousands, and if there is no “guarantee” of one or the other, it must instantly be a failure. 

Since the time of my DD, Carnival has jumped nearly 30%. So, this is the time when I post all my pictures of my massive gains, right? Wrong. 

My instincts were right, my DD solid, and my money in the right places. However, I second guessed myself into selling at only a $50 profit, when I could have made THOUSANDS on my calls and stocks. 

The conclusion? Take critique to your DD but your principles and fundamentals are important, and do not trust the critique of random WSBetards who use fancy words to make it seem like they know what they’re talking about.

All from day trading calls and puts. 35k today being a bull in tsla at first and then transforming into a gay bear for the dump. _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Google is running a scam. Their GOOG stock is a Pyramid scheme. GOOG is a C class stock without voting rights and it doesn’t pay dividends, and they said that they will not pay them in the future. The company explicitly said in its 2017 annual filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that "we intend to retain any future earnings and do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future." Google states the "par value” (the amount Google owes you for the stock) of each GOOG stock is 0.001$ US Dollars. Yet each stock is sold at 1700$ in the stock market.

Why does one buy a GOOG stock? To make money. But since GOOG doesn’t pay dividends, the only way to make money is by selling it to other investor at a higher price. But that investor is buying that stock from the first to also make money, by selling it to others at a higher price. And if everyone is buying GOOG stock to sell it to someone else at a higher price, then what real value GOOG stocks have?

If you come to Alphabet Inc, and show them your 1700$ stock and told them to repay it, they will pay you 0.001$ US Dollars.

So the only way you can make money, is by taking money generated by new investors.

Definition of a Ponzi Scheme: “A Ponzi scheme is a fraudulent investing scam which generates returns for earlier investors with money taken from later investors. Ponzi schemes eventually bottom out when the flood of new investors dries up and there isn't enough money to go around. At that point, the schemes unravel.” So if GOOG is a ponzi scheme, when do investors dry up and the scheme is unraveled like other Ponzi schemes? The unraveling gets hidden, because It is masked as a bubble burst.

When the new investors stop buying stocks, last investors holding that stock cannot sell them at a higher price and the price of the stock crushes, we call it a bubble burst.

If GOOG doesn’t give any money to its investors, and only source of money for investors are new investors, than it’s a zero sum game. Like a gambling game with other people, but with fees attached to be able to play at a casino, in this case Google.

But it isn’t advertised as a gambling, GOOG is advertised as an investment by Alphabet, making clueless investors buy GOOG stocks, not knowing that its just a zero sum gambling. This is at the edge of criminality. I don’t even know how is it legal.

The simple truth is, GOOG is a Ponzi scheme, being advertised as an investment, when in reality it’s a zero-sum gambling game where the winners are those who sell them first before others, and if everyone knew that it was a zero sum gambling, GOOG stock price would crush right now and no one would want to buy it anymore. This is outrageous.

This makes all quants who kept yapping about how TSLA pricing action via option gamma squeeze will subside once it's included in S&P screech in horror. Who knew the meme stock can continue its action unabated? TSLA hits ATH almost everyday this week, closing Friday up 7.84% to $880. Unreal.

* For a succinct difference of Elon chan's prowess vs Bezos, refer to chart below:

Elon | Bezos |

Talks about new gigafactory and everyone wants to give him sick tax breaks to build in their city/state | Shops for new second HQ to give high paying white collar jobs but AOC and gang gets up on his ass in asking for tax breaks |

* Morning economic numbers: nonfarm payrolls once again looking terrible, with consensus at about 50k increase but instead saw a -140k Dec. This ends a 7-month streak of steady gains in recovery. No worry fam, if you've lived thru March 2020 lows you'll know that market doesn't give a fuck about employment #s until you go all-in on calls. US reports more than 4k covid deaths for the first time ever - refer to above on why market doesn't give a fuck.

* Flurries of behind-the-scene political actions are happening as the country moves on from Y'all Qaeda's storming of the capitol. A number of high-level admin officials from policy advisors to cabinet members have bailed the sinking ship that is this current administration. Chatters of invoking 25th amendment. Second impeachment. POTUS has stated that he will NOT attend the upcoming inauguration (who knew he's a gdamn snowflake?), after finally putting out a statement that an orderly transition will occur. 

* Psuedo-SJW social media companies and platforms have banned POTUS in tandem, conveniently doing so after the Dems have clinched both chambers of Congress and will likely sit on committees regulating them. No real movements from these actions yet, though TWTR is pulling back after it banned POTUS for 12 hours until he deleted the offending Tweet. TWTR closed the day down -1.62% to $51.48, after an intraday low of more than -2%.

* BA got a slap on the wrist with a 2.5 bil fine from the DOJ for killing non-Americans. About 10% of the fine goes to the US govt while about 500 mil goes to the families of the 346 people that died in the two 737 Max crash. Remaining (70%) amount goes to BA customers because let's face it, corporations are truly the ones really hurting. BA closed down -1.32% to $209.

* It's a solid day for many Chinese ADRs as as BABA and TCEHY escape Treasury's list of delisting stonk. BABA closed up 4% for the day at $236 while TCEHY closed up 5.61% to $76.89. NIO, the TSLA of China (or is it XPEV? or LI? find out in 1.5 years!) closed up big at 8.55% to almost $59, despite offering to sell 68m more shares last month at $39. Surely the US market isn't going to be China Hustled.

* Today's big movers: DDD and PLUG continues their wild rocket moves to the stratosphere as strong market sentiment continues. DDD closed up 2.48% to $23.54, after touching an intraday high of almost 10% earlier. PLUG closed up 13% to $53.78.

* PSTH, Ackman's brainchild SPAC flew almost 12% today on ZERO news but faded towards end of the day. PSTH gang collectively jizzed and made a mess of themselves. Will it be Stripe? (it's not) Chick-fil-A? (it's not) Bloomberg? (eh they sorta denied it) Subway? (please god no). Find out eventually sometime Q1 2021 as Bill continues to edge us. Seriously Bill, announce something amazing already because I'm up more than 20k on zero news and I'm tempted to sell. PSTH closed up 7.24% to $29.32.

* In WSB meme stock land, a new law is being formed where none of these gdamn stock can go up together on the same day. PLTR faded to flat of 0.80% after being up more than 3% during early mornings, whereas GME and MT both fade some more today after a decent run-up attempt this entire week. GME close the day down -2.16% to $17.69, while MT pulls back from a week's worth of solid gain at -2.7% to $24.83. WSB's new meme ETF ICLN had some profit taking happened much to the displeasure of people who fomo into the ETF this morning, not realizing the sea of red candles were not bullish indicators. ICLN close the day down slightly to -0.75% to $33.15. Funny enough, OTM monthly calls haven't pulled back that much due to the magic of IV.

* While initially red through out most of the day, the DOW reversed course and closed up 0.18% or 56 pts, S&P up 0.55% or 20 pts, Nasdaq up a solid 1% or 134 pts, and RUT closed flat at -0.25% or -5 pts. It's the weekend and WSB newcomers addicted to FDs will no doubt flood the weekend thread, constantly asking if their $700 portfolio (funded in part by the $600 stimulus) with OTM calls will be okay. Don't worry new fam, stonk only goes up.

Literally just to speak with the clerk. As I asked her about PS5 and Xbox sales she said they were backordered into the summer. This was also, just the store's online orders. They only got 4 of the next gen systems for launch. I then went to GNC next door to meet up with my Chad bro and tell him my DD. At this point, the GNC guy proceeds to tell me a story about how he went to Gamestop during pre-orders for receipt paper (apparently GNC is having massive supply issues) and that he somehow managed to be in line perfectly to be put on the pre-order list for a next gen system. He was the ninth person in line per his words.

TL;DR GNC is bankrupt and gamestop has enough paper to give away to other struggling retail.

Long GME till Monday's conference._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ AAPL Bottom Jeans, Boots With The Fur 🍎 🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ GME Fundamental Analysis We all heard about how no one could get their hands on the new consoles when they came out back in November. I thought the supply would have caught up by now, but just yesterday I heard a guy say that he tried to buy a PS5 and still couldn't get one. This prompted me to check out Gamestop's online store and sure enough, they have no PS5's or Xbox's anywhere. Heck, even the Nintendo switches are nearly sold out. I think Cohen is doing a good job leading GME into e-commerce and I highly doubt the stock can go much lower from where it currently is because of the huge $17 support right below the current price.

Papa is going to Mars. Now ask yourself why that is. Is that purely because of benevolence or are there business reasons for it? Well, now you might think... if we have Mars colonies, humans are still gonna do the dirty so eventually there will be new customers there. And you couldn't be more wrong.

Remember, Elon 10Xes himself everytime. Tomorrow its Mars, the day after its the next solar system, the day after that its the next galaxy. Now, math isn't my strong suit. But what is the probability that we discover new species (read: new customers)?

Do you just exist as a flourescent bacteria in a pool of primordial ooze? Flash twice to enter into a futures contract with Tesla where you pay for a fraction of the price now, and your evolved descendants will get the best available Teslas once they have a pair of arms and legs.

Are you at a hunter-gatherer stage of evolution? Skip domesticating horses or whatever you got there, and go straight to exchanging ivory tusks for Teslas. Save your planet from the evils of industrialization as a side win.

Is your civilization literally powered by every single energy unit your sun produces? Then you don't need a Tesla, but you know how this will play out. Go straight to buying Tesla shares.

Edit: VALE 22c 3/19_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Nano X Fraud (NNOX) Summary
In response to TLDR, NNOX is a pump and dump.   They are going to announce FDA 510 approval.  Only idiots will buy it. SHORT THE SHIT OUT OF THIS BITCH. PUTS, BEAR CALL SPREAD, BEAR PUT SPREAD, YOU NAME IT. THIS STOCK EXISTS TO BUY ISRAELI CROOKS HUMMUS.  THATS IT. GOOGLE NNOX FRAUD AS WELL. 

Now here is the rest:
Nano-X has made a range of claims concerning their cold cathode X-ray technology on their site, in interviews, and in a recent demonstration at the Radiological Society of North America.

As a PhD physicist and patent attorney, I am in a good position to analyze the technical aspects of these claims and the Nano-X patent portfolio.

I restrict myself in this piece to the technical aspects of the Nano-X cold cathode and do not treat other issues that have been raised (e.g. CEO track record, sales partners, FDA).

From the available evidence, the Nano-X tube does not appear to have any demonstrated nor potential relevant technical advantages over existing technology. Long term, our forecast is pessimistic.

The valuation of Nano-X (NASDAQ:NNOX) is amplified beyond its intrinsic worth. I believe a close look at the website, interviews, and promotional material of the company reveals consistent overstatement of their case and disingenuous conflation of issues of technical import, to give the erroneous impression of a breakthrough technology.

Nano-X is using a 'cold cathode' X-ray tube, where the heated filament of the standard X-ray tube is replaced by a set of nanometric pointed tips, which release electrons at room temperature and relatively low voltage. This difference, which conceivably might be leveraged for competitive advantage in certain situations, does not appear to be useful in the context of medical imaging. On Nano-X's 'Our Tech' page they have listed a series of purported advantages deriving from their cold cathode, which we address in order, after which we look at a few more issues of interest.

Rapid time switching
In a hot cathode, the acceleration of the electrons towards the Anode ‎‎‎(thereby creating X-rays) is done by activating and switching a high voltage supply. This process ‎‎takes time (on the order of milliseconds). ‎In a cold cathode, one can set the high voltage and ‎switch only the gate voltages - a process ‎that can take only microseconds.‎

•	It is not clear how this is relevant to medical imaging; millisecond turn-on and turn-off times are quite sufficient even for the frame rates of a full body CT, which reaches at most tens of frames per second. Blur can be a problem due to the rapidly moving CT mechanism but it appears the limiting factor here is not the turnon/turnoff time but rather the amount of illumination possible to deliver in the short timeframes available (e.g. 50ms less the turnon/turnoff time for a 20fps device). And as we stress below, Nano-X is not making a CT machine.

Been doing what I could with 10k since a week before the US election _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ 💎🙌 Till next friday. Thanks Papa Elon. _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Small short-term OIL play based on current geopolitics **Up front, this IS NOT a political post**. I don't care and don't want to hear about your politics in the comments. This post is intended as an example to demonstrate how *degenerates* could ~~gamble~~/invest or legitimately hedge, based on international geopolitics.

***TL,DR*** *- there's a lightly elevated risk of a crisis in the ME, oil might go up a bit as result, options on oil futures --> Tendies; BUT be careful.*

**So what's the "play"?**

Buy call option exp mid Feb on CL or other oil future (I'll explain pros and cons of CL below), but ditch at end of the month. Cost currently between 200-300 bucks per contract for a $60 Call on CL.

**Technical considerations and warnings:**

First off, do NOT buy the underlying future unless you know what you are doing, and since you are reading this, you probably don't. The CL future is for 1000 barrels (so quote x 1000 gives you price at the till) for physical delivery at terminal. So if things don't go your way, you stand to lose $1000s and will need to find some tanker trucks fast. Note, because of this, these option contracts are also priced as quote x 1000. So 20c is 200 bucks for the mathematically challenged among you. You know who you are ;).

The options, if things don't work out, will just laps and your max loss is obviously limited to your premium just like with an FD. If things go well, you still need to sell in time though, bc the options settle through to the underlying contract. Some brokers will force you to sell automatically close to expiration.

If you absolutely want to own a future, may I suggest QM, which is for 500 "virtual" barrels and thus is settled financially rather than by delivery. But no options available on those.

**Why not Brent or other crude "varietals" instead of CL (which is West Texas Intermediate)?**

You could, if your broker has the options chain for those. I chose CL for convenience and due to better liquidity usually. No good if you want to exit your contract and nobody is there to buy it from you at a reasonable price.

**Are there drawbacks to CL over others?**

Yes maybe, crude is traded based on the fields it comes from and has distinct qualities for each, so it does not move in lock step. Refineries are even calibrated to the kind of crude they can/will process. So an event in the middle east would likely affect local brands stronger than US ones. But you should still see an effect. Just note, when WTI/CL went negative last spring,  Brent was still positive, because the capacity constraints causing the negative excursion did not apply to it.

**So what makes you think a move is likely?**

Tensions between Iran and the US have been heightened for a while and definitely increased when Soleimani was killed during an air raid last year. A few days ago the Pentagon ordered the USS Nimitz to turn around and head towards the Persian gulf as a warning to Iran. Iran recently voiced personal threats against members of the current administration. Lastly there has been talk in Beltway circles and press that the outgoing administration might want to limit political options vs. Iran for the incoming team by escalating the Iranian issue into a hot conflict.

**What speaks against your theory?**

In light of recent events, there are moves by Congress to constrain the military authority of the outgoing administration, making last minute actions more complicated. Iran might also hold still, depending on the situation, in the hope of trading short term pain for a reset of relations with the US. The goal there would be to get sanctions relief. Sanctions have escalated domestic tensions in Iran and the regime might want to counter their destabilizing effects.

So with the above, there are no guarantees, things might go either way, or nothing at all might happen.

**Is there anything else?**

Yes maybe, Saudi Arabia has recently somewhat unexpectedly cut production quotas to lift the price of oil. One might speculate that pandemic related budgetary pressures (domestically) drove this move, and it could not be the last cut. While this will not make you rich it might help you break even upon exit in case nothing else happens.

Finally, if there were a conflict, it would most likely lead to a market correction, esp. if there is a large upward excursion in the crude markets. Given that these options are for 1000 underlying barrels, a 10 dollar in the money call would give you a 10k hedge against any (short term) dips of the regular markets.

**Are you invested and are you just pumping?**

Yes and hopefully no. I own one contract currently with no real intention of getting more. The volatility and prices for oil are driven by forces so much larger that even the combined might of all Robinhood brosefines and brosefs, so would likely not move these things much. Production quotas, global demand and political events that affect either are the dominant drivers here.

**Ok, fine so when should I get out?**

For something expiring mid Feb I'd get out sometime between the 20th and 30th of Jan, since that seems to be the end of this event window. That's my plan at least.

And what do we all have in common? Degenerate options gambling habbits. Which is why im long CBOE as of just now because every retard in reddit, tiktok, preschool, nursing homes are playing god damm options. You know those small few cent regulatory fees that you have to pay even on "free" brokers when you play options? Who do you think gets that shit, thats right its CBOE, the Chicago Board of Options Exchange. 

To be more specific,  CBOE generates a majority of its money through transaction fees. 76% of their revenue is based on their exclusive license agreements regarding S&P 500 Index options (42%) and volatility-based options and futures (36%). And with daily volume in single-stock options averaging17.3 million contracts during 2020, up 68% from 2019, CBOE WILL BE SWIMMING IN MONEY. 

In fact their Q1 revenue jumped by 300 million from Q4 2019, due to the popularity of VIX and associated derivatives during the crash, but have since fallen off as the market recovered and these products were used less. Personally I bought 105 calls expiring after earnings to take advantage of the IV hike that happens before earnings. I dont plan on holding through earnings doe. 

TLDR: Retard like option, CBOE make option, CBOE MOON 🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Leverage is infinite money cheat TLDR: When everyone is on >1x leverage, and leverages up on every stock going up, we have infinite demand for a stock.

For those who did not understand right away:

  1. let's say we all buy $TSLA on 3x leverage.

  2. $TSLA goes up 2% tomorrow.

Which means we have more buying power (remember, 3x leverage)

  3.  we use the new 4% of buying power to buy more tesla stock. This promts it to go up another x%. 

Repeat from step 1_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Tesla Bubble Will Burst Since the week of 9/14/20 where Tesla was trading around $400/share post-split, it has had little to no institutional accumulation. This means that the stock price has more than doubled on almost pure speculation, and my guess is that the big boys have been unloading some shares to retail investors who will buy them, but at a slow enough rate to not alarm anyone. When the big boys decide to rug pull it will be ugly. I don’t know when this will happen but it’ll be sooner than later. 

I understand Tesla’s at the forefront of world changing things, but the parabolic growth is beyond the realm of its reality. 

This is just my opinion and I don’t have a position in Tesla. I don’t care if it goes up or down this is just what I see.

Would love to hear your opinions on this_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ TLRY is a STEAL right now. We're going high as a kite bois 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 Hi Retards. TLRY is the best pot stock and will skyrocket as legalization approaches. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀


**Why is weed the first thing on the agenda? **🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Legalization will come a lot faster than expected. Listen to Cuomo
"New York has the potential to be the largest sports wagering market in the United States, and by legalizing online sports betting we aim to keep millions of dollars in revenue here at home, which will only strengthen our ability to rebuild from the Covid-19 crisis" In the same speech, he talked about expanding Marijuana use.
Basically, Cuomo linked sports betting and Marijuana together and has too. Budget deficits due to Corona have destroyed public finances, now politicians have a double incentive. On one hand, they can reduce budget shortfalls by taxing betting and pot, and on the other they get approval from dems. Passing pot laws is a win-win for every politician. It is easy to do and doesn't cost shit. This basically will get top priority.
Market doesn't expect such speed. This is why this is a great play for short and long term gains

**Why TLRY? **🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

The merger with APHA will give TLRY a massive cash position. TLRY can legally sell weed in the US, as it's registered, giving them the potential to tap into this HUGE market. TLRY will be a monster in the US AND Canada, making them the largest weed stock by far. For those of you retards that care about fundamentals, they're absolutely amazing when compared to other garbage pot companies.
Analysts expected 50% revenue growth in 2021 BEFORE the senate turned blue. They can easily achieve 100% growth this year if weed is legalized in the first half of 2021 (almost certain). The combined power of APHA and TLRY will give them the possibility to meet customer demand, unlike other stocks that just don't have enough capital to fulfill all the new orders they're gonna get. Estimates give them 17% market share but they don't take the synergies into account, The combined firepower of TLRY and APHA will give them at least 20-22% market share.
The merger will also allow them to sell in EUROPE. This is massively underestimated. Seeing that the US is starting to legalize, Europeans will follow suit. Belgium, Italy, Portugal, Spain, Switzerland, Croatia, and others already legalized weed in some form.

**Conclusion **🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

The marijuana industry is known for being volatile and, at times, unpredictable. But right now, all signs are pointing to growth.
The political atmosphere in the U.S. has never been more favorable to pot stocks, and we’re seeing the market respond to that goodwill. We’re likely to see that goodwill expand in 2021, which means we can expect marijuana stocks to rise in tandem.
All that comes together to form what is perhaps the most bullish market for pot stocks we’ve seen in the past few years. And it’s likely to get even more bullish.

TL;DR TLRY HAS A HUGE POTENTIAL THANKS TO ITS MERGER WITH APHA. SYNERGIES WILL HELP THEM MEET NEW DEMAND AND INVADE EUROPE 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Bulls eat CORN _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ STZ: the next meme stock 🚀✨🌟🪐💵 Alright, retards ... time to drop some boomer stock knowledge

Constellation Brands ($STZ), owner of Corona and Modelo beers, is loading up the train to tendie town and you better get your ass onboard. I'm going to completely ignore their premium beer & wine boomer business and focus on why I think this thing is **WAY** undervalued and the best (hidden?) cannabis play around. 

But first, story time...

October 2017: Constellation makes waves with a $191 million investment in Canopy Growth Corp (CGC), Canada's largest pot producer, for a 9.9% stake. This came in roughly 18 million shares of common stock, and 18 million warrants. 

Then weed stocks pretty much pumped and dumped, then floundered in the low single digits

May 2020: Constellation [increases stake](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/constellation-brands-raises-stake-in-canopy-growth-to-38.6-percent-2020-05-05) to 38.6% by exercising those 18 million warrants for roughly $10/sh (12.97 CAD), and puts another $**4 billion** into CGC. In total owning 158 million shares, *ANOTHER* 140 million warrants, and like 150 million of senior debt. \*NOTE\* the warrants from the 10/17 deal were \~33% below market value (CGC was $15/sh on 11/1/17 so using that logic the warrants acquired on 5/5/20 should be roughly the same cost basis since CGC was $15/sh on May 5th).

Fully diluted, they actually **CONTROL** Canopy Growth: "Collectively, the common shares now increase Constellation Brand's ownership of Canopy Growth to 38.6 percent of the issued and outstanding common shares. Assuming full exercise of all remaining warrants and full conversion of the notes, Constellation Brands would own a nearly 55.8 percent stake in Canopy Growth."

Pretty fucking sweet, right? Especially in a blue wave US government that could legalize cannabis in the next 2 years of congress control.

BUT WAIT, THERE'S MORE!

July 2020: Constellation [acquires](https://www.forbes.com/sites/chrisfurnari/2020/07/01/constellation-brands-buys-gary-vaynerchuks-direct-to-consumer-empathy-wines-brand/?sh=7d59f0db4cea) Gary Vaynerchuck's D2C wine business Empathy Wines, showing some pretty outstanding vision considering alcohol delivery is [legal in 34 states](https://abcnews.go.com/US/states-explore-keeping-alcohol-demand-delivery-permanent-covid/story?id=70902208) plus PR and DC. Cutting out retailers should provide a huge boost to operating margins as COVID normalized home delivery for pretty much everything. 

Fast forward to today:

Jan 7th: Constellation fuckin [destroys their ER](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2021/01/07/constellation-brands-ceo-on-q3-earnings-high-demand-for-hard-beverages.html): beats EPS by 65 cents. Stock shoots up 7% then settles down around +2-3%

Jan 8th: Constellation gets [a ton of PT upgrades](http://prnt.sc/wj764t) from GS, DB, Cowen, MKM, etc etc. Targets mostly $250-275. 

Current price? $226. And down over 1% today. This is a crouching tiger, hidden tendie bazooka if it goes meme status. Those 140 million warrants should entitle STZ to CGC shares at $10/sh and they're trading at $30/sh today - ***which is probably the biggest hidden value here.*** 

When everyone's favorite drink is a CBD-infused seltzer you'll be drinking yours in a golden chalice for the balls it took to yolo into this boomer stock in January.

Stumbled across an opportunity with Foley Trasimene Acquisition II Corp (BFT) that I thought I'd share with you all. For those who are unfamiliar, BFT is a lower tier meme stock here on WSB. It's a SPAC that [intends to acquire PaySafe](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201207005389/en/Foley-Trasimene-Acquisition-Corp.-II-and-Paysafe-A-Leading-Global-Payments-Provider-Focused-on-Digital-Commerce-and-iGaming-Announce-Merger), a leading digital payments platform for \~$9B. Paysafe has about $1.5B in revenue and is growing in the eCommerce and online gaming markets. Plus they have a [pretty spiffy investor deck](https://www.paysafe.com/fileadmin/user_upload/Foley-Trasimene-Acquisition-Corp-II-and-Paysafe-investor-presentation.pdf) full of vague promises of profitability if you take away most of their expenses. Next stop, the moon.

**What's the trade?**

1. Buy BFT shares in blocks of 100 at \~$14.80
2. Sell 10/15/21 $20 covered calls at \~4.75
3. ???
4. Profit

**What do our outcomes look like?**

* Best Case Scenario: BFT goes to 20 or above. We get called on the options we sold and we pocket a $5.20 gain + $4.75 premium for each share, for a return of $9.95 on our $14.80 initial investment per share (67% return in 9 months). We do max out at 67% though if this bad boy really moons.
* Worst Case Scenario #1: Acquisition falls through, BFT shares return towards their liquidation value ($10). We lose on our shares, but since we got that $4.75 covered call premium we're only looking at a loss of \~$.05 / share
* Worst Case Scenario #2: Acquisition goes through and the stock tanks. Theoretical max loss is $10.05 per share (cost basis - premium for covered call), but realistically I think we can assume Paysafe isn't going to zero between now and October. 
* Anywhere in between we're probably making money as our adjusted cost basis is \~$10.05
* So basically it literally can't go tits up. Right guys?

**5. After adoption of Rule 204, why are there still threshold securities and why is there still a threshold securities close-out requirement?**

**Even after adoption of Rule 204, failures to deliver may occur in certain circumstances. The appearance of a security on a threshold list does not necessarily mean that there has been abusive “naked” short selling or any impermissible trading in the stock. Delivery failures can be caused by both long and short sales. In addition, notwithstanding actions by broker-dealers to close out delivery failures, certain securities may remain on an SRO’s**[**\[17\]**](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm#_ftn17) **threshold securities list for a variety of legitimate reasons, such as:**

* **Despite proper action to close out fails, new delivery failures from long or short sales, at the same or other broker-dealers, result in the security staying on the threshold list;**
* **One or more broker-dealers may have temporary but legitimate problems in obtaining the stock they borrowed in time for delivery;**
* **Long sellers may have difficulty in producing stock in good deliverable form to their broker-dealer.**

$IPOE$ Social Capital Hedosophia Holdings VCorp will be a meme stock by the end of 2020. Yesterday they announced their merger with SoFi. SoFi, incase you didn’t know is one of the largest lenders in the world and they have been developing a very large product suite over the past few years. In regards to the SPAC merger alone, SoFi will be valued at 8.65B post merger...IPOE currently has a market cap of 1.92B; so theoretically the stock price should increase based on fundamentals alone.

So, what does SoFi have to do AWS of Fintech...well they purchased Galileo Financial Software in April of 2020. For those of you who know the popular Fintech companies: ROBINHOOD, CHIME, DAVE.COM, MONZO, MONEYLION, TRANSFERWISE; all of them utilize Galileo Financial Software.

I was joking about the idea to take over Papa John's with some of my friends yesterday to get Schnatter back in control of his company, and when I started doing my research I actually liked what I saw purely from an investment standpoint. This post will have two main parts: how we can get Schnatter his job back and also how we can easily make money on PZZA. We'll do the money stuff first.

&#x200B;

**Chart**

As of writing this, PZZA is currently trading at $94.10 and the ATH is $102.25. It is basically guaranteed that it will go back to the ATH. It has also sailed past the 20 and 10 day moving average, so there is no resistance until ATH. This is great for options.

&#x200B;

In addition, I suspect that PZZA could be forming a cup and handle pattern. If this plays out, the price target would be (ATH + (ATH - Bottom of Cup)), which is about $131.38. However, we won't know if this is a cup and handle until it happens.

https://preview.redd.it/umhvpr1ou4a61.png?width=1140&format=png&auto=webp&s=b468ffd791469758f0679d390c4b6d72cad01a35

Even if the pattern fails, a delivery pizza restaurant is a pretty safe place for your money to be during the pandemic.

&#x200B;

**Other Numbers**

[Target price](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/PZZA/research-ratings) of $104.50 with a high of $116.00. I think this is low going off the chart.

[31 million shares](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=pzza) float. I know that's a lot, but Schnatter already owns almost [1.3 million shares](https://ir.papajohns.com/stock-information/ownership-profile).

Guys, it's take out pizza in a pandemic it should really be self explanatory.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Now we can talk about how Schnatter can become reinvolved with the company, which should help PZZA stock even more. As you will see, ever since he left the company has not been in as good of a position.

**Why Schnatter Left**

In 2017, he made a controversial comment about how the [NFL player protests were hurting Papa John's sales](https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/12/22/572779230/papa-johns-ceo-steps-down-following-controversial-remarks-on-nfl) because they were the official pizza sponsor of the NFL. I don't want this to get political, but this is essential to talk about. Schnatter stepped down as CEO but remained on the board of directors. Fast forward into 2018, where Schnatter was reported to have [used a racial slur](https://www.forbes.com/sites/noahkirsch/2018/07/11/papa-johns-founder-john-schnatter-allegedly-used-n-word-on-conference-call/?sh=376e4e6e4cfc) in a meeting and it was recorded. Then, he stepped down from his position and no longer had a role in the company (besides for shareholder).

&#x200B;

**Schnatter's Fight for Innocence**

Ever since both of these allegations have surfaced, Schnatter has maintained his innocence and that his words were taken out of context. In a [recent interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lYGrUA6YjA) Schnatter had with the H3 Podcast (I know many people don't care for them, myself included, but those opinions don't change what Schnatter says in the interview) where he explained why both allegations were false. Regarding the NFL drama, Schnatter claims that he was talking about how the NFL had a leadership problem because they were not addressing the issue. [His exact words were,](https://www.foxbusiness.com/retail/ex-fbi-director-clears-papa-johns-founder-of-racial-bias-slams-clearly-inaccurate-media) "*The NFL is hurting, and more importantly by not resolving the current debacle to the player and owner’s satisfaction, NFL leadership has hurt Papa John’s shareholders."* In regards to the allegations of him using a racial slur, former FBI director Louis Freeh, wrote a [report](https://papajohnschnatter.report/read-the-report) where he explains how that in the phone call where he used a slur, he many times stated how he does not support any form of racism, and when he said the word, he was referring to how Colonel Sanders used it and it bothered him. There are two parts to the recording that Schnatter has been fighting in court to get released. The first part includes him using the slur and the context, and the second part includes the other people on the call celebrating after Schnatter hung up talking about how "they got him" and they needed to get it to the press right away. This is all according to the H3 interview. It is common sense that Schnatter would not want a recording made public that would damage him, and the company seems intent on keeping it secret, showing that they are likely hiding something.

&#x200B;

**Sales are Slumping**

[Sales are decreasing](https://www.statista.com/statistics/221441/papa-johns-total-revenue/#:~:text=Revenue%20of%20Papa%20John's%20worldwide%202007%2D2019&text=American%20pizza%20restaurant%20franchise%20Papa,seeing%20a%20decline%20in%20revenue) every year since his role as been minimized. It's as simple as that. They are in no way a failing company, they are just making less money than they were.

*Processing img 934fvr5jq4a61...*

In addition to slumping sales, in the [H3 interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lYGrUA6YjA), Schnatter claims that Papa John's total number of customers is down significantly and that the quality has decreased. He says he buys about 600 pizzas every 90 days from stores around the country to check on the quality. In my personal experience, I can say the quality at my local Papa John's has decreased over the past couple years.

&#x200B;

**Why Schnatter Can Fix This**

Schnatter is more devoted to Papa John's than most CEOs (after Karp and Elon), even though he technically doesn't work for them anymore. As I said before, he does frequent quality checks on the restaurants. The reason he does is is because he cares about the franchise owners and employees who have been negatively impacted by the new management and slumping sales. Who else still puts effort into a company after they've been fired from it? Also, this is just speculation, but since he is still closely associated with the company it is still his reputation.

&#x200B;

**What we can do**

It's simple, buy shares! If we buy enough shares of PZZA, we (along with Schnatter) can become the majority shareholder of the company. There are [just over 31 million shares float](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=pzza) and Schnatter still owns almost [1.3 million shares](https://ir.papajohns.com/stock-information/ownership-profile), or 3.88% of the company. If he can convince a few of the other large investors that it is in their best interest to see him in charge again, we can easily call a shareholder meeting, vote out those who wrongly accused him, and put him, back in charge.

&#x200B;

**Historical Implications**

Schnatter has long been touting "The Day of Reckoning" but has not given any hints as to if it has already happened, if it is multiple events, or what it will be specifically. If we can accomplish this, WSB would go down in history (it already has) again for giving a man his company back... and we will make money in the process. We can be the day of reckoning!

&#x200B;

**Is This Legal?**

Yes, it is perfectly legal. This would technically be a hostile takeover, which is legal, but we can just call it something else. Besides, I'm pretty sure Ryan Cohen is trying to do the same thing with Game Stop.

&#x200B;

**TLDR**

PZZA chart shows easy money, Schnatter is innocent of accusations, only he can bring Papa John's back to its former glory, and we can be the ones to do that. The Day of Reckoning is here!

EDIT: Here is a template to complain with Provided from [**u/Isthiswittyenough92**](https://www.reddit.com/user/Isthiswittyenough92/)

*To whom it may concern,*

*This letter serves to bring the SEC’s attention to suspected illegal activity in GameStop Corporation’s (ticker GME) trading. As a shareholder in GME, I have concerns about illegal naked short selling and increasing failure-to-deliver rates in the month of December 2020 through present day. GME has consistently appeared on the NYSE Threshold Security list for the last 21 trading days. In order to appear on the threshold list, a stock has to have 0.05% of outstanding shares fail-to-deliver, for GameStop this amounts to roughly 350,000 shares.* ***GME’s failure to-delivery rates have exceed this amount on most trading days in December 2020***\*.\* ***Furthermore, on at least three trading days in December,*** ***the total number of shares failed-to-deliver exceeded 1 million***\*. Below is a summary of trading days in December which had exceptionally high failures-to-deliver:\*

*12/1: 91,971 @ $16.56*

*12/2: 1,061,397 @ $15.80*

*12/3: 1,787,191 @ $16.58*

*12/4: 999,475 @ $16.12*

*12/7: 1,002,379 @ $16.90*

*12/11: 880,063 @ $14.12*

*12/14: 284,296 @ $13.31*

*Given the data presented above, I request the SEC to further investigate suspected illegal naked short-selling in GME, particularly as it concerns Melvin Capital, who holds a substantial short position in the Company.*

It’s here boys. That stock, that one stock, you have been dreaming of. That stock that you buy with hopes of transforming you into a millionaire. That stock is here, delivered to us by Chamath, in the name of SoFi.

This is the Fintech Stock that will merge with Chamath’s SPAC IPOE by end of Q1’21. 

TL;DL:

1. Merging at valuation of $8.7 Billion. Super cheap.

2. FY2020 revenue $670 Million~. $980 Million by 2021. $3.67 Billion by 2025.

3. Lead by Anthony Noto (former COO of Twitter and Goldman Sachs MD). Blessed by Chamath who only looks for investments with 10x potential.

4. Galileo Acquisition Last Year - This is like back end platform of many fast growing financial service providers such as Robinhood, Chime, Dave.com, Moneylion. Currently has 50 million accounts on its platform. Chamath is quoted of saying that this is the “AWS of fintech.”

5. 1.8 Million customers in 2020. 3 Million customers by 2021.

6. Profitable by 2021. Profits expected to be $1.17 Billion in 2025.

7. Currently offers student loan refinancing, mortgages, investing, banking, credit cards, crypto, personal loans, etc. They are going to use $2.4 Billion from SPAC merger to build their banking business. This is what all other high growth Fintech (like SQ) are doing. But similar to AMEX, SOFI’s existing customer base are high earning professionals who are lawyers, doctors, bankers, etc.

8. They recently partnered with Samsung and Mastercard to launch a new cash management account feature with no fees. They have innovative, member first platform to provide one stop financial services for millions of Americans and simplified process for those looking to apply for loans, invest their money, obtain insurance and refinance their debt.

9. Bottom Line: They are going to disrupt the traditional banking business. If LMND is in hot demand because they are expected to be the disruptor in the insurance business that appeals to younger generation, this is the disruptor for the traditional banking business with clientele geared to high earning professionals.

10. Why It’s Cheap? Because they wanted to get their banking license two years ago but they had trouble getting it. But in October, they got the pre-approval for the banking license and SOFI is using proceeds from this SPAC merger to build one. You are getting in at the bottom of its high growth phase over next 2-4 years. This is the kind of investment that will pay for the down payment towards your first house or your kid’s college.

11. Valuation Target? Chamath said he only invests companies with 10x potential. This stock will get to $200 PT by end of 2022. It will be profitable this year. Both their revenue and profit will be in billions+ by 2025

I haven't seen a lot of DASH talk on here, so trying to get a convo going about running this cold Big Mac over charging overvalued POS into the ground.  I mean, cold tendies are better than no tendies, but.... Dash is Trash.

&#x200B;

Alrighty, so here are my positions.  Note\*:  I already paperhanded 10 - 100 put expiry 2/19 - for a 2k loss

  
1 - 100 put expiry 2/19 - Cost $4 (Already Getting Crushed)  
3 - 120 put expiry 5/21 - Cost $13.31  
5 - 110 put expiry 5/21 - Cost $12.00  


Ok, so here's the little I know...   
1.  DoorDash's market cap is over 50 Bn now.  Which in my IMHO is at least 2x too high.

2.  We are still in lock up period... So, I feel like they are going to dump after that ends in like March.

3.  It looks like SoftBank holds the lion's share of currently tradable shares, and they ain't selling (yet).

4.  In regards to #2-3, this POS was trading sidewise at 140, IMHO trying to burn options.  F\*\*\*ing worked on mine.    
I've never seen anything like this before (Trading for like 3 years, WSB lurker for like 1 yr, and freshly minted member 1 month ago).

5.  I feel like it's going to go back to that 140 range after a short squeeze today, I could probably bale as soon as that happens and break even or even make back a little of the 2k I already lost.

Watch for a break of yesterday’s high/low to determine which direction price is likely to continue in the short term. _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Some disturbing DD on MicroStrategy MSTR MicroStrategy—and Michael Saylor—have a chequered past. In 2000, Saylor, together with two other MicroStrategy officials, were [accused of fraud](https://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/15/business/microstrategy-chairman-accused-of-fraud-by-sec.html) by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for falsely reporting massive MicroStrategy profits despite the company losing money, artificially inflating its value. This cooking of the books was picked up on by auditors and is what led to the SEC charges. Ultimately, Saylor and the other two were forced to settle with the securities regulator. Though he did not admit or deny the accusations, Saylor was hit with a $350,000 penalty and was forced to return $8.3 million to shareholders.

The period in which Saylor was falsely reporting MicroStrategy’s profit was accompanied by a similar PR blitz, with the stock seeing an 80-fold increase in value over this time and was lauded as a success story; Saylor promised to contribute $100 million toward the founding of an ‘Internet university.’ These plans never materialized, and Saylor was settling with the SEC within a year.

The company survived the controversy, though it has been the subject of criticism since. The chief investment officer of hedge fund firm Apex Capital called for MicroStrategy to be overhauled, which would include the ousting of Saylor. They complained that the company’s senior staff were ‘not fully engaged in the day-to-day operations of the business or agonizing over inferior shareholder returns’ and, for example, hadn’t held a shareholder conference call for almost 10 years. In a similar vein, Saylor has come under criticism for [racking up massive personal expenses](https://ffj-online.org/2014/06/09/saylor-story/), well in excess of what would be expected even for larger companies.

Both benchmarks were tracking for weekly gains despite Monday’s sharp drops, the first negative starts to a new year since 2016. The Nasdaq was also solidly higher for the week as Wall Street powered higher over the past two days despite Wednesday’s deadly siege at the U.S. Capitol and its fallout.

> Bitcoin, which topped $40,000 on Thursday for the first time ever, passed $41,000 on Friday. The world’s largest cryptocurrency has been up more than 30% in the first days of 2021 and 400% over the past 12 months. The value of the entire crypto market, which is made up of bitcoin and other digital coins, topped $1 trillion Thursday for the first time.

> Tesla shares marched higher in Friday’s premarket after rising 10 sessions in a row, surpassing Facebook in market value, and making CEO Elon Musk the world’s richest person. Thursday’s increase in Tesla’s share price pushed Musk past Amazon’s Jeff Bezos, who had been the richest person since 2017.

> # 2. December jobs report could be weaker than forecast

> The pace of job growth likely slowed dramatically and could even be negative in December, as the coronavirus spread rapidly across the U.S. Economists expect to see a gain of 50,000 jobs, down from 245,000 nonfarm payrolls additions in November. The Labor Department’s monthly employment report is out at 8:30 a.m. ET, and the stock market could react more to a positive surprise than a negative one. The 10-year Treasury yield remained above 1% early Friday ahead of that report.

> # 3. Trump finally concedes Biden will become president

> President Donald Trump late Thursday admitted — for the first time in his own words, despite vowing never to concede — that a “new administration will be inaugurated” on Jan. 20. In a nearly three-minute video, posted after his Twitter lockout ended, Trump did not mention President-elect Joe Biden by name. It came a day after the outgoing president sparked the riot that saw a mob breach the U.S. Capitol in protest of the election.

> # 4. Pelosi, Schumer call for Trump removal from office

> Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi are calling for Trump’s removal, accusing him of inciting “insurrection.” Schumer said that if Vice President Mike Pence and the Cabinet do not move to invoke the 25th Amendment, Congress should reconvene to impeach Trump.

> Pelosi said Congress “may be prepared” to impeach Trump if executive branch officials do not act.

> Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo were among the Cabinet secretaries who discussed the possibility of invoking the 25th Amendment to remove Trump, three sources told CNBC. They determined the process of elevating Pence to the presidency could take more than a week, diluting its effects.

> # 5. Single-day Covid deaths top 4,000 for first time

> The U.S. had its first day of over 4,000 deaths from Covid-19. In the single worst day of the pandemic Thursday, 4,085 people died from the virus. The latest coronavirus surge iaw record seven-day averages of new daily infections and deaths running at 228,497 and 2,764, respectively. As of Thursday, the number of people hospitalized with Covid fell slightly from Wednesday’s record high levels.

> A coronavirus vaccine developed by U.S.-based Pfizer and Germany’s BioNTech appears to be effective against a key mutation in the more infectious variants of the coronavirus discovered in the U.K. and South Africa. The research by Pfizer has not been peer reviewed. The World Health Organization said last month that health authorities were “urgently investigating” whether the virus mutation affects vaccine performance.

Lemonade rises by more than 20% again while reports continue to come in on the Apple Car. Let’s talk about this and other stock market news**

**\~Very Long Post\~**

Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let’s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw a big rally in the stock market after the [Biden](https://ibb.co/QpPkkvg) confirmation and Trump called for a smooth transition with the tech heavy [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/sw8bKdb) recovering the previous day losses and closing at over 13K. We also saw the broad stock market [SP500](https://ibb.co/MnjT8BH) gaining almost 1.5% and finishing over 3800 while the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/ykPckZD) also posted a gain of over 200 points to close at just over 31k with all 3 of the big indexes finishing at new records. This broad rally pushed the [VIX](https://ibb.co/5MY0P1w) down, as the volatility index finished the day lower by more than 10% as 9 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/nmc7x8X) finished in the Green with Technology leading the way up 2.7%, while Utilities was the biggest laggard dropping by 1.3%.

Growth companies largely outperformed [yesterday](https://ibb.co/XpHGdhb) with both small and large cap growth companies posting big gains across the board, while value plays lagged behind, as 2/3 of the companies were advancing [YESTERDAY](https://ibb.co/NLLMyLY) with over 300 new highs on average volume.

So, let’ take a look at the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/ys6zg6M) from yesterday, as big tech companies flourished with the likes of Apple, Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Nvidia, Tesla and many more posting gains at least 2%, while most of the losses were concentrated in the Chinese stocks that are being delisted and the more value heavy utilities sector.

Yesterday we also received the investor sentiment [SURVEY](https://ibb.co/10gRPgn), which saw a worrying move in the stock market, as bullish investors surpassed 50% of the total investors and is near the 1-year high from November. Most of this move to the bullish side came from neutral investors, which are way below the historical [average](https://ibb.co/XbyKxjB), which probably decided to get back in the market, rushing in the clean energy sector, the industrials and many others after the Democrats swept the Georgia election. I remind you that I usually use this survey as a contrarian indicator, when sentiment moves to this much greed in the market, I usually don’t like to add to my positions, as I await to buy stocks on red days.

We also received some economic data yesterday, as we saw December’s homes for [SALE](https://ibb.co/7Y3njz3) fall to an all-time low, below 700K as the housing market keeps on booming, with homes selling faster by about 2 weeks compared to last year while the national inventory dropped by almost 40% since last year, as the median listing price was $340K, up over 13% since 2019.

[Today](https://ibb.co/t4bS0wH) is a quieter economic day, with the biggest number coming in the early morning as we wait to see the non-farm payrolls.

In some other stock market news, we saw [Nikola](https://ibb.co/DLP8f1P) joining the broad rally in the EV [STOCKS](https://ibb.co/mJgVqwr) yesterday which pushed almost every single stock higher, while we also saw a report from JP Morgan on some possible good developments on their trucks. I don’t believe in this company, it’s bad history, bad management and reputation will hurt it in the long even if they manage to develop a decent product, which is still to be seen, as they haven’t really brought anything innovative to the market.

One other stock that rose yesterday was [Lemonade](https://ibb.co/FbZZ5Lz), as the stock spiked more than 27% yesterday, after the company was pitched by the Motley Fool yet again. I really like this company, and I think it has major disruption potential in the insurance world, so I agree with this report. The stock did suffer a slight pullback about a week ago after a report from The Friendly Bear but I don’t believe it will have a long-lasting effect, as I believe this stock has great growth potential.

[Apple](https://ibb.co/Xzscpk6) also seems to be confirming the previous reports and is in talks with Hyundai about a development of a self-driving EV, as we heard something about this from Hyundai before some confusion made them kind of back out of the previous statement. This report is pretty much as anticipated, as Apple would probably be looking to either collaborate on manufacturing with a traditional car manufacturer or actually just acquiring pretty much any one of them.

We also saw [Snowflake](https://ibb.co/vZ1v7yw) regain some momentum yesterday, rising by more than 13% despite the expiration period of another 38M shares. The latest IPOs and small-cap stocks have recently been able to raise a lot of capital as investors seem to be grabbing any share available at almost any price regarding valuations. This is a very dangerous thing yet again. This kind of stuff was happening in the last dot com bubble, though… I don’t really expect anything like that to happen with the overall stock market, but I think we might see some stocks have a big crash when valuations start to come back in the mind of investors.

Meanwhile we saw 2 big milestones for Tesla & Elon Musk yesterday as the company [passed](https://ibb.co/yXnFsbp) Facebook as market value goes as Tesla is seeing huge trading volumes as yesterday, it [traded](https://ibb.co/6BYkLP9) more shares than the next 3 big movers Apple, Alibaba and Amazon, while Elon Musk [became](https://ibb.co/xS0G5Sk) the richest man in the world, on the back of a 16% increase in Tesla stock already in 2021.

And two last pieces of good news are that the it’s expected the [FED](https://ibb.co/6FTNrSF) will likely hold rates near zero until 2024 while [Pfizer's](https://ibb.co/6nGSdWR) vaccine seems to be working as expected on multiple mutations, especially the latest highly transmissible one.

So, let’s hope for a good day as the European [markets](https://ibb.co/LdhPq9P) and the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/wSTgstr) are up to start off the day, with the Nasdaq Leading the way up over half a percent.

The torch has been fucking PASSED!  And to who, but our leader?  C'mon boys, we can pump it a little more for celebratory purposes and get Elon to 200B for a day.

The viral video of loser white guy getting fatality'd with a can of tea sent shockwaves through the meme community.  Saw a string of videos on tiktok of people dramatically opening a briefcase and pulling out a twisted tea like they're boutta air out the scene with a glizzy.  And that was just **ONE** of the chain of free advertising videos, made sometimes and reposted often by kids who *didn't/can't/don't* even drink TT or alcohol.  That girl on Twitter has posted multiple times about how this event already is and will continue to affect her work schedule for the coming month.

Alllll kinds of search trends exploded for "Twisted Tea" and "Sam Adams".  Someone posted a week or so ago with screenshots of different explosive search trends, tried finding that post and their account but failed at both (like most things in life).  EDIT—u/Altruistic_report105 posted it 3 days ago, fuckin go nuts n look at the good data he posted.

Not to mention the fact that Sam Adams is a high volume stock, trading healthily at almost exactly a grand a share, and they **fucking murdered** their last two earnings.  They crushed 2019 in sales & are currently set up by meme power and alcoholics normalizing their problems to kill another earnings report, coming 2/17 after hours.  

Why is the meme power so important?  Why is this sudden late boost in sales so important?

**Because the dusty old millionaire shareholders aren't on social media and have no clue about the true potential because they play sudoku on paper and thus aren't pricing in the coming action.**

I'm not saying that Sam Adam's doing good is gonna be news to them; but every single time the big dollars are aware of a catalyst and possible positive price action change backed by a strong financial quarter, they price that in for options and then our lottery calls are too expensive and risky to play.

This is just the latest showcase of the massive iron ore shortage the world is facing in the wake of the pandemic. Governments everywhere announced/will announce massive infrastructure plans to spur on the economy.

With India possibly out of exporting, iron ore prices can only go up, meaning other iron ore producers are set to profit massively. The last time iron ore prices where this high VALE was at almost $40 (+100% upside from today)

Just go on the app store and read their reviews for fucks sake.._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Wind Energy Market in the US: ICLN and Vestas I’m very new to all this (started trading 2 weeks ago), so I might be wrong, but, as I understand it, ETFs will take the profits from the shares that moon and dump them into their other holdings. Wind energy is one of the biggest untapped markets in the US, especially in places like Texas where there hasn’t been much funding. So I’m, with my very limited knowledge, guessing that ICLN will dump their PLUG profits into their only wind holding: Vestas

So I have a couple questions:
1) Am i a retard
2) why is the ticker I’m seeing (VWDRY) different from the one iShares lists
3) I was told that this is a foreign stock in the form of an American Depository Reciept (ADR) so I can’t buy calls, but why isn’t that the case for something like BABA and will that ever change?
4) are there any other wind stocks that might be better? of course, I’m hedging on the cycle of ICLN dumping into this, the stock rising because everyone else buys too, and then ICLN buying more to keep up with demand, but there could be other options_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Tesla begins next phase in massive battery acquisition plan by stealing battery packs from SpaceX rockets _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Phat DD on constipated flight centre ASX: FLT

Bullish case: 

Flight centres biggest markets are (in order) Australia - America - UK. InAustralia we see no to little community transmissions and a planned rollout of vaccines early March. Without a vaccine there’s been an increase of 200% in bookings in Australia through Flight centre online (and that’s with borders starting to partially open up again) for December and throughout early 2021 with hotel and flights being fully booked out. Australia’s market for flight centre is largely made up of corporate travel, however, that could change momentarily due to lockdown fatigued and people wanting to travel for leisure and go on a holiday (which mind you we already see a huge increase in demand for holidays) and corporate travel likely to come back even in small increments we could see a huge increase in revenue and profits in 2021’s earnings (most likely beating expectations). An increase in profits is and a possible increase in profit margins due to operating cost decreasing and most likely staying at the same level until full operation. This is where it gets tricky though, they are well know for their walk in deals when customers come into the store, but since the recent closing of more than 100+ stores in Australia alone, Flight centre would have to heavily push for online consumption of their products. Which is why some people say Webjet is better placed, but flight centre has a lot of money due to their capital raising, and if they can use the money well and offer online deals, marketing campaigns and still keep open their remaining stores with in store deals. They will have multiple income streams from different infrastructures (unlike webjet). For example, boomers mostly don’t know how to use the internet and would rather face to face because it feels more authentic while the younger generation don’t care which one they use as long as they get discounted cheap prices for fully planned holidays that they themselves after lock down probably can’t be stuffed planning themselves. Also there are quite a few vouchers by state governments incentivesing people to travel (not to sure how many or how much). 

This also comes with Flight centre recently upgrading and improving their online ability to more efficiently help customers by upgrading to a K2 cloud operating system. 

https://www.google.com.au/amp/s/itbrief.com.au/amp/story/flight-centre-travel-group-updates-cx-and-operations-with-k2-cloud


So my price target in the next 6-12 months is $40, but this would mean People are willing to take the vaccine and corporate and leisure travel actually hit pre COVID level and even all time highs (which is doable but highly speculative)



NOT FINACIAL ADVICE_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Lemonade (LMND) am I missing something DD So I was scrolling through tickers tonight and came by Lemonade (LMND) it was in my watch list at the beginning IPO and kind of through it out sometime in October. Then I saw it was at 150$ plus today and was like what is up with this. Based on articles with 1 million subscribers and huge growth and all this doesn’t make any sense and I swear this company is going to drop hard. 

Quick Math: They reached one million subscribers this year. They will have a projected revenue of $93 million for 2020 when next quarter results come out.

They are making on average $93 per customer as an insurance company per year based on “1 million” subs. That is $7.75 per month for customer. That is cheaper than streaming services and they have to pay out claims. 

Compare this to Netflix: 
1 Million Subs for Lemonade: Market Cap-8.5 Billion
200 Millions Subs for Netflix - Market Cap-225 Billion

Based off subscribers/market cap ratio if Lemonade got 200 million they would be worth 1.7 trillion. Also, based on there current revenue per customer they would be hauling in 1.5 billion as a 1.7 trillion company.

So in other words, this company can’t and won’t succeed and their has to be some misleading of investors with the financials. I don’t get how they have a million subs and only 93 million and revenue. There is no chance they can make a profit by doing this and by the way they haven’t.

https://youtu.be/2DWlp6FZmqQ_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ [Serious DD] Canoo/$GOEV and the potential Apple/Hyundai partnership Tl;dr If Apple partners with Hyundai, it will most likely be based on the Canoo base platform. This is purely speculation, but grounded in real facts based on looking at the primary area of collaboration for Hyundai's EV partners, Canoo's founders' history with Apple and Canoo's investor presentation.

Let's dive into the FACTS:
Hyundai is in early talks to develop self-driving electric vehicles with Apple [Link](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/08/hyundai-motor-says-it-is-in-early-talks-with-apple.html). Hyundai also has a couple partnerships to co-develop EVs with Rimac, Arrival and Canoo

First take note that in Apple's initial press release, they announced they would be focused on a "personal, mass-market vehicle rather than a robotaxi or commercial vehicle" [Link](https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a35036439/apple-car-2024/)

For this reason, Canoo is the most likely partner. I'll illustrate using a quote from a press release where it mentions the focus of the Canoo partnership is on small, cost-competitive EVs + PBVs (in other words, mass market vehicles), which is the market Apple is focused on. [Link](https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/11/21133461/hyundai-canoo-electric-cars-partership-kia)
"Canoo and Hyundai Motor Group, Hyundai and Kia’s parent company, will develop a new electric vehicle platform that’s based on the one that powers Canoo’s own vehicle, which was unveiled last year. This EV platform will power small, “cost-competitive” electric vehicles, as well as “purpose built vehicles,” which would more closely resemble shuttles or even autonomous people-movers."

The reason it is much less likely to be with Arrival or Rimac is based on reading their partnership announcements with Hyundai as well.

From Arrival article [Link](https://www.hyundai.com/worldwide/en/company/newsroom/hyundai-and-kia-make-strategic-investment-in-arrival-to-co-develop-electric-commercial-vehicles-0000016387) : "€100 million investment enables co-development of eco-friendly vans and other products for logistics, on-demand ride-hailing, and shuttle service companies." 
The target area of the Arrival partnership is on commercial vehicles (delivery vans, shuttles) as opposed to consumer vehicles that Apple will likely target.

From Rimac article [Link]( https://www.hyundainews.com/en-us/releases/2772): "Hyundai Motor Group and Rimac Automobili (Rimac) have announced a strategic partnership aimed to strengthen the Group’s efforts to lead the high-performance electrified vehicle market and enhance its status as a game changer in Clean Mobility."
The target area of the Rimac partnership is high performance, sports concept vehicles also unlikely to be Apple's target market. 

Another piece of potential evidence is from Canoo's investor presentation [Link](https://charts.stocktwits.com/production/original_270955872.png). The picture mentions a project in progress with a Tech Strategic who is "a player in smart car and autonomous vehicle that has identified Canoo as a base platform to integrate systems."

There is also plenty of history behind Apple and the Canoo founders to explain why this speculation is actually fairly reasonable thinking. In 2015, Apple was very close to using the BMW i3 as the basis for its Apple Car [Link](https://www.silicon.co.uk/e-innovation/apple-bmw-i3-electric-car-173344/amp). This deal fell apart, but it shows that Apple was impressed by the BMW i team's EV platform. Fast forward 2 years and Canoo is the creation of those same former BMW i-Execs including Ulrich Kranz (former Head of BMW i) and Richard Kim (former Principal Exterior Designer of i3 production vehicle and i3 and i8 concepts at BMW)._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ One of us _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ DD on Tesla ($TSLA). Bubble or Nah? Alright. Hear me out autists. We all know bears are gay. But with TSLA shares reaching an ATH of $816.99, it sure seems like its fundamentals are completely divorced from reality. And the media analysts have been pounding on TSLA for seemingly years now. So is this a good company to be a gay bear on? Or Nah? (edit: TSLA ATH now @ $884 lol)

&nbsp;

On 7 Jan 2020, Royal Bank of Canada admitted that "There is no graceful way to put this other than to say we got TSLA's stock completely wrong" and upgraded TSLA from $339 to $700. And on 6 Jan 2020, Morgan Stanley upgraded their TSLA price target to $810 when just 18 months ago they announced their comically low price target of $10 (that's $2 post split) resulting in a massive rally. Did  Morgan Stanley dive head first into WSB level 3 autism territory, or is there something that the uninitiated could be missing? Let's do a deep dive into Tesla the company and see if their stock really is in a bubble, or if there could be some substance behind the current insane rally.

&nbsp;

---

&nbsp;

The common FUD narrative among TSLAQ is that TSLA's $700+ billion market cap is now larger than the 10 largest auto manufacturers combined. Indeed, this is quite insane. Even without us autists doing complex calculations, a simple google search shows that they would have to sell around 70 million vehicles a year to be priced at that level. So how many vehicles did Tesla produce? Tesla announced on 2 January 2020 that they've sold a little shy of 500K vehicles for CY 2020 with plans to increase production by 50% YoY. This would ultimately bring them to 20 million vehicles produced by 2030. 

&nbsp;

20 mil by 2030. Although we all know the term "Elon Time", which refers to CEO Elon Musk casually announcing an estimate of a product and missing projected timelines by large margins, there seems to be some credibility to this statement. Back in 2014, Elon Musk [gave an interview (2:28)](https://youtu.be/arauCxOuDxU?t=148) where he stated that he "feels comfortable being able to achieve at least half a million cars a year by 2020". 

&nbsp;

OK. So let's give him the benefit of the doubt. As a matter of fact, Tesla is actually building factories at breakneck speeds with construction literally running 24/7 and each of their large factories (Austin and Berlin) is said to be capable of producing up to 2 million vehicles a year. Giga Berlin which was an empty field 9 months ago is already [close to finishing its outer construction layer](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0173/8204/7844/articles/2_c51cdcab-d351-40f5-860f-1aa95dd1d3d7_1800x.jpg?v=1609802044). Obviously they plan to announce more factory constructions in the future as well. So they do seem to be on track to grow on average 50% YoY for now. But 20 million cars produced by 2030 is still massively shy of 70 million vehicles. Even with growth factored in, TSLA's stock valuation still seems insanely high. So what gives? The common explanation among the Tesla fanboys is that TSLA is a tech company, not an automotive company, so it should be valued just so. 

&nbsp;

So what is this mystical technology the fanboys speak of, and how is it being deployed in terms of profitability for Tesla? Well, it turns out that Tesla has three main technological advantages and two main revenue streams that might put them leaps and bounds ahead of competitors.

&nbsp;

1. **Autonomous Driving** - Tesla is the current market leader in vehicle autonomy. It has over [3 billion miles logged](https://lexfridman.com/tesla-autopilot-miles-and-vehicles/) as of April 2020. The next industry leader Waymo (owned by google) has approximately 20 million miles logged. One thing for sure is that no company will be able to catch Tesla in terms of pure data advantage within the next 4-5 years. And when it comes to Artificial Intelligence, data is king. This could be the bread and butter of Tesla. Tesla already charges customers $10k per vehicle to enable full self driving in which 25% of their customers choose the option. However, Tesla hasn't taken full profits on their books yet due to it still being in beta mode. Once they solve autonomy, an over-the-air (OTA) software update will be sent out just like how your iPhone updates and bam! now you have self driving vehicle. Let's say Tesla charges $2k a year for a self driving vehicle that can also function as an autonomous uber driver which will help you pay down your vehicle or self driving subscription service. That's like selling two iPhone pros per every customer every year. And customers on their robotaxi network will also have to share 20% profits with Tesla. Think about this. The highest cost of ride hailing are for hourly wages. If no human is required to drive that vehicle, the cost of the ride hailing service will become insanely cheap. So cheap to the point that many people who live in cities will feel like they no longer need to own a vehicle and just call a robo taxi. People already do this in large cities! As this process accelerates, vehicles that don't have autonomy solved will lose market share dramatically every year. People who want cars will buy Teslas, and people who don't care about owning a car will use Teslas as a robo taxi. The entire auto industry is ripe for disruption just like how the iPhone ended Blackberry and Nokia.

2. **Vehicle Manufacturing** - Tesla is an innovator when it comes to vehicle manufacturing technology, specifically robotics. Along with their insane factory automation process, they also have giga casters that mold car pieces quickly and efficiently that no other manufacturers have, and giant automated paint shops. This cuts down massively on labor and allows for quicker production while keeping margins high. Due to innovative technologies like these, it is estimated that Tesla's Shanghai Model 3 vehicles [net around 30% profit margins](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/13/teslas-shanghai-gigafactory-will-boost-margins-morgan-stanley.html), even after they've recently slashed their prices by 8%. Tesla recently slashed their [Model Y price by 30%](https://insideevs.com/news/463797/china-tesla-announced-new-prices-model-y-sales/) but still boast an [astonishing 29% profit margin](https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-china-model-y-gross-margin-30-percent-report/) which is approximately 3 times the industry average. So even if robotaxi doesn't work out, they are still an industry leader by a large stretch in terms of profit margins. These margins will only increase after Giga Berlin is operational due to no longer having to ship vehicles across the Pacific to European customers.

3. **Vertical Integration** - Tesla is famous for its vertical integration. This is mainly due to having supply chain issues in the early days, but what this has enabled is agile production capability and larger profit margins. Due to this capability, Tesla improves components of their vehicles on the fly instead of the annual model release the traditional industry uses. Also, they don't have to share profits with suppliers or worry about constraints, delivery delays, or slow progress on contracts. 

4. **No Advertising & Dealerships** - Elon Musk is a walking billboard. The media literally gives Tesla free advertisement every day. As production increases, Tesla might have to start advertising in the future. But for now it seems like Teslas are selling themselves. Tesla has literally sold 100% of the vehicles they've ever produced, and they have never advertised any of their vehicles. Also, they do not have to share profits with dealerships with direct-to-consumer sales. If their market dominance and technology superiority continues, it is bound to stay the industry leader just like apple did with its iPhones. And if they solve autonomy first which they seem on track to do so, what's more to say?

5. **Regulatory Credits AKA Carbon Credits** - This is one that TSLAQs love to bring up when it comes to Tesla profits. You see, a handful of US States enacted a law that requires manufacturers to sell a certain percentage of [Zero Emission Vehicles (ZEV) in their state](https://www.currentautomotive.com/what-is-a-zev-credit-and-how-does-tesla-make-money-with-them/) which will earn them ZEV credits. If not, they will either have to pay a massive penalty fine, or buy ZEV credits from vehicle manufacturers who have plenty to spare. And Tesla has an overflow of ZEV credits laying around. So Tesla is literally getting paid by other vehicle manufacturers to build their vehicles. TSLAQs (incorrectly) state that the only reason Tesla makes a profit is because of regulatory credits. However, Tesla's [**ZEV credits only make up around 5% of their revenue**](https://tesla-cdn.thron.com/static/4E7BR9_TSLA_Q3_2020_Update_P0Q85U.pdf?xseo=&response-content-disposition=inline%3Bfilename%3D%22TSLA-Q3-2020-Update.pdf%22) and it is slowly falling. No serious vehicle manufacturer will likely produce ICE vehicles in the year 2030 so ZEV credits fazing out is to be expected. Tesla vehicles are massively profitable as mentioned in bullet #2 even without the ZEV credits.

&nbsp;

So we went over the main revenue streams of Tesla. And if all works out well, it seems likely that Tesla has a good chance of 'winning' if they maintain their market leadership. However, the competition is coming, right? We have our favorite EV players such as Nio, XPeng, Li, Rivian, BYD etc. Also the traditional ICE manufacturers VolksWagen has their ID.4, Ford has thier Mustang Mach-E, Audi has thier etron, Porche has their Tycan, and GM has the Chevy Bolt and 30 EVs planned for the future. It seems inevitable that these industry giants with their massive resources will overtake Tesla. Or will they?

&nbsp;

## **Why the Competition is NOT Coming (Tesla's Moats)**:

&nbsp;

1. **Difficulties of creating an EV vs. Mass Production**: Creating a shell of an EV or a prototype is extremely easy. If anything, Nikola has showed this to be true. Rivian seems to be having the same issue Tesla had when starting up where they had to constantly push back release dates due to how difficult it is to engineer and manufacture an EV. So designing a prototype is easy. Manufacturing an EV is another thing. But mass production is a whole different beast. It took Tesla well over 16 years to perfect their technology and mass produce their model 3 despite having the best engineers in the world working for them. Ever wonder why every single vehicle manufacturer has constantly been pushing back their EV production timelines? It's because EVs are difficult. Also to note is that no vehicle manufacturer other than Tesla has been able to achieve mass production in EVs. And until then, Tesla has no competition in the near horizon.

2. [**Supercharger network**](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ErACHc5XUAA7RD-?format=jpg&name=medium): Tesla has the largest charging network in the world by orders of magnitude and they will continue to grow. VW is a low trailing second in the market due to penalties in their dieselgate scandel and as a lucky maneuver, [decided to build their electrify-america charging network](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/10/vws-2-billion-penalty-for-diesel-scam-builds-ev-charging-network-across-us.html). BTW, due to sunk costs, VW will likely be the only traditional ICE manufacturer that stands a chance of survival in the long run. Tesla owners barely get range anxiety like they used to back in the day. This is because it is easy to find a charging station even if they are going on a long trip with their map integration. However, you cannot say the same for the other EVs.

3. **Lidar vs. Camera**: Tesla's vehicles famously does not use lidar technology. Instead, they almost only rely on vision (cameras). There are three main reasons for this. (I.) Cameras are extremely cheap. Lidar is not. One of Waymo's vehicles are estimated to have [cost over $250k](https://qz.com/924212/what-it-really-costs-to-turn-a-car-into-a-self-driving-vehicle/) back in a 2017 estimate. Although in recent years Waymo seems to have developed lidar hardware that costs 90% less at $7.5k, it is still ridiculously expensive compared to cameras without adding much value. Here is Elon Musk's explanation, massively paraphrased: "Cameras augmented with AI can do almost all the things that lidar does chiefly depth sensing. Human vision does not require a separate depth sensor, and the entire driving infrastructure is built with human vision in mind. Lidar is a fools errand." Instead, Tesla augments its self driving technology with radar and maps. (II.) Lidar technology is usually augmented with something called HD maps. This is extreme detailed mapping (to the centimeter level) that helps lidar depth sensors with navigation. However, the issue with HD maps is that the file sizes are obviously large. And when detailed maps need to be updated due to construction or whatever which happens everywhere, every day, an OTA update needs to be sent out. And how do you update a fleet of all your vehicles when nationwide full coverage of 5G isn't a thing? So vehicles like Waymos are extremely good at driving within their geo-fenced locations, until they leave the area. And then they are absolute crap at it. OTOH, vision-based self driving vehicles are initially bad at the task until they have sufficient data and then they can drive well in almost every situation even without it being connected to the network. (III.) Vision-focused self driving AI can be augmented with additional sensors such as radar/lidar afterwards, but the inverse does not work. To put it short, if your lidar sensors disagree on the information they see at the moment, its entire system cannot function.

4. **Technological Dominance**: Tesla's vertical integration and engineering produced innovative solutions such as the [octovalve](https://www.tesmanian.com/blogs/tesmanian-blog/deep-looks-into-tesla-model-y-s-octovalve), [heat pump](https://www.currentautomotive.com/model-y-is-the-first-tesla-with-a-heat-pump-heres-why-thats-a-big-deal/), [leadership in battery and vehicle efficiency](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK79ioBW8Mg), [custom designed AI chips](https://youtu.be/Ucp0TTmvqOE) and an AI supercomputer server ([Tesla Dojo](https://www.tesmanian.com/blogs/tesmanian-blog/tesla-supercomputer-dojo-v1-0-will-be-ready-in-about-1-year-says-elon-musk#:~:text=The%20Dojo%20is%20a%20Neural,during%20Autonomy%20Day%20in%202019.)) specifically made for autonomous driving advancement. No other company can come close to what Tesla is currently doing.

5. **Misdirected Competition**: Remember how we talked about ZEV credits? Well most ICE vehicle manufacturers only sell their vehicles in ZEV mandated states and nowhere else. They literally lose money when they sell their vehicles, or have to massively hike up their prices to make a profit even with tax credits, unlike Teslas. For this reason, they only make enough vehicles to make up for their ZEV credits. Naturally, one can assume the limits of effort gone into such vehicles. Now, let's talk about the EV start ups. I've already mentioned the massive growing pains they will have to reach mass production. However, the Chinese EV startups have one thing to their advantage - massive 5G infrastructure within China which will undoubtedly benefit automation, especially in the case of HD maps. However, this doesn't apply outside of China. To add to this, they do not produce in-house custom AI chipsets which is a [massive hinderance](https://equalocean.com/analysis/2020072714353) in processing data. Tesla did this with Nvidia for a while and ultimately decided that they had to design their own chips because of the lackluster performance.

6. **OTA Software Updates** - A minor point, but Tesla has been designing their own software for years now. Well known to the public, Teslas update very frequently and with each update gets slightly better UI and performance. Yes - a software update allows Teslas to get better efficiency out of their vehicles. One can argue that any auto manufacturer can implement OTA software updates, but Tesla is leagues ahead at the moment with top notch software developers.

7. **Talent Pool**: Guess what the [#1 company engineers want to work for](https://electrek.co/2020/11/11/tesla-most-attractive-company-engineering-students-massive-advantage/) is? That's right. Tesla. #2 is SpaceX. Try all they want, but the best engineers aren't going to want to work with Ford or GM.

8. **"The Competition"**: I already mentioned the half-assedness of traditional ICE vehicle manufacturers but I wanted to bring up another point. One thing that traditional ICE manufacturers have weighing them down are their employees. Their ICE engineers don't translate well into a totally different EV drivetrain. There are sunk costs (equipment etc) that deal with ICE manufacturing processes. Also, Ford, GM, and VW all have unions, pension funds, and stockholders. What do you think their reaction will be when they decide to ditch the currently-profitable-but-soon-to-be-shrinking ICE vehicle component and transition into resource intensive EVs? That's right. They won't like it. The only solution is to half-ass it and slowly transition into EVs while trying to keep afloat their ICE vehicle component. With massive product line diversification and lack of focus, this is not going to be an easy transition. VW CEO Herbert Diess famously stated that "*My goal for the future is clear: leading the Group into a sustainable and successful future. The global transformation in the industry will take roughly ten years, with or without Volkswagen*." and tried to convince board members basically stating that [**VW will need to transition into EVs within 10 years or go bankrupt**](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-we-transform-volkswagen-herbert-diess). Ultimately, Diess wasn't successful in achieving full cooperation of the board and had to compromise in his goals to a more gradual transition. The competition is NOT coming. Oh, and as for Waymo and Uber? Well Uber recently sold off their self-driving startup, and Waymo famously sunk in at least $3.5 billion in the first few years of operation. I mean, they are paying drivers to monitor their expensive "autonomous vehicles" while Tesla gets this done while making a profit. As of 2020, Waymo still [only has 600 vehicles](https://www.ft.com/content/6b1b11ea-b50b-4dd5-802d-475c9731e89a) and has never left the bounds of Pheonix, AZ. 

&nbsp;

OK. So I'm sure I've missed some points but I think this paints a decent picture on why Tesla is considered the one and only market leader at the moment. Now let's go into...

&nbsp;

---

&nbsp;

## **Tesla's Disruptive Potentials**:

&nbsp;

1. **The $25,000 EV**: In Tesla's battery day announcement, Tesla projected that their battery technology will enable them to build a $25k vehicle in the future. According to [projections using Wright's law](https://ark-invest.com/articles/analyst-research/wrights-law-predicts-teslas-gross-margin/), this seems to be plausible. Most think this will happen around 2023-4. Think of the disruption this will bring. EVs are famous for having lower maintenance cost vs. ICE vehicles due to not having as many moving parts. The true cost of ownership for a $25k vehicle will be vastly superior to a $20k ICE vehicle. Once this happens, **ICE vehicle demand will fall through the roof**. The only ICE vehicles being sold at high volume will be used vehicles. What happens to the traditional ICE manufacturers then?

2. **Tesla Auto Insurance**: Tesla collects massive amounts of data. They can easily profile their customers' driving patterns, check if they have self driving enabled, the route they drive etc. Currently Tesla vehicles are insured at a much higher premium vs. economic ICE vehicles. Once Tesla goes fully into the insurance business, traditional insurance companies will not be able to compete with them on price or margins. This is because the insurance business is based upon data on the customer and projections.

3. **Solar City** - Tesla's other business deals with solar panels, Tesla power walls, and their Autobidder software which sells the electricity that you generated back to the grid. Tesla currently offers the lowest solar panel price in the U.S. and moreover, takes 20% of the revenue generated from their autobidder software. Renewable energy is poised to grow. More than 50% annually is the current projection. And Tesla seems to be one of the industry leaders in this market as well.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

## **Risks**: 

1. **Failing autonomous driving**: definitely a major risk as the current stock price is largely betting on this single technology to materialize. However, [their current progress and the rate of improvement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHe4hFvgDc) after rewriting their autopilot code seems promising.

2. **Failing mass battery production (battery supply issues)**: Although Tesla is the largest producer of batteries in the world, they will need to produce more if they want to keep up with the current pace of expansion. This will be a major bottleneck for Tesla if they cannot solve this issue. As a solution, Tesla has reduced their reliance on copper and are said to be producing batteries with little to no copper. We shall see how this pans out.

3. **Tesla has infamously poor Quality Control** on their vehicles and slow/poor customer Service. We shall see if time solves this issue

4. **Lack of Tax Incentives**: Tesla's vehicles no longer provide Federal tax incentives to U.S. customers. However, they seem to be doing fine with over 80% marketshare in the U.S. alone.

5. **Elon Musk Death**: Elon Musk has been able to achieve amazing engineering feats. If he dies, I'm sure a lot of the company's potential will go with it.

&nbsp;

---

&nbsp;

## **Alternative Battery Technology**: 

&nbsp;

1. **Solid State Battery** - Quantumscape which is currently the leader in this sector has plans to enter mass production by 2024. We shall see if their battery technology turns out to be as efficient as Tesla's. If QS's SS batteries turn out to be superior to Tesla's, they might have to start purchasing from them.

2. **Hydrogen Fuel Cell (HFC) Battery** - Likely not a good use for vehicles. [Very low efficiency and wasteful](https://insideevs.com/news/406676/battery-electric-hydrogen-fuel-cell-efficiency-comparison/#:~:text=Depending%20on%20the%20model%2C%20the,is%20from%2025%2D35%25.) vs lithium-ion batteries. Currently no infrastructure for HFC in place. Might be useful for freight shipping. Elon Musk famously stated that HFC's are "Fool Cells"

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

## **Tesla Future Products Lines**: 

1. **Cybertruck**: Insane profit margins, amazing performance. estimated production end of 2021 or 2022

2. **Semi Truck**: estimated production 2022 or later

3. **Model S Refresh**: Insane specs. Likely release is 2021

4. **2020 Roadster**: Insane specs but surprise! The "2020 Roadster" renewal never happened and most are projecting 2022 or later

5. **$25k EV**: 'nuff said

&nbsp;

---

## **TSLA Analysis**: 

&nbsp;

TSLA Institutional Ownership: 62.85%

TSLA Insider Ownership: 5.21%

TSLA Fanboy Ownership: estimated 5%+

So there is a stable 70%+ of ownership that will not sell this stock, unlike PLTR which has only 12% institutional ownership and 63% insider ownership. This is the reason why I think the stock won't drop tremendously even when it tanks.

&nbsp;

---

&nbsp;

**Why did TSLA shoot up so quickly in 2020**: This is my personal opinion, but TSLA fans are known for doing deep research into the company. In the early days this was in forums such as the [Tesla Motors Club](https://teslamotorsclub.com/) where they shared their own research on revenue, projections, and potentials. Now we have YouTube and information dissemination has gotten easier. Interest in investing has skyrocketed in 2020. Stock market trading GLOBALLY has gotten easier via smartphone with apps such as Robinhood and the prosperity of the American stock market has no doubt attracted global retail investors. For years, Tesla's stock has been pushed down by FUD analysts. Paid by big oil and traditional ICE manufacturers? Or really that dumb not to do any DD and spread completely false information on a company that you are massively shorting. We might never find out. Retailers have caught onto Tesla's potential ahead of analysts this time. And as in Morgan Stanley and RBC's case, analysts have just been catching up on the future potential of Tesla to not make a further fool of themselves.

&nbsp;

---

&nbsp;

**Future scenarios and Personal Opinion**: Currently, Tesla holds over 18% of the global EV marketshare. As more EV players come into space, it might seem like Tesla is in danger of losing marketshare. Not everyone wants a Tesla and that is understandable. But as the overall pie is growing, Tesla, with their 50% YoY production increase plans (which is exponential growth), will likely remain a market leader sustaining their current 18% market share even in 2030 just like how the iPhone did. 

&nbsp;

Even if TSLA fails to develop their robo-taxi network technology, their full self driving subscription seems highly likely to materialize at the current pace albeit a lower revenue model. 

&nbsp;

Ultimately, do I think the current stock price is a bubble? Fuck yes I do, maybe by up to 20%. I'm not buying any more TSLA shares anywhere near this price. My FOMO was back when the stock price was $415 after doing my DD and this was with the intention to buy more shares even if the stock bottomed out. Well, it never bottomed because the S&P inclusion was announced shortly after I purchased it. 

&nbsp;

But if you ask my personal opinion, you gotta be a "buy high sell low" type top level autist if you're looking for short term gains and purchasing at this level. I'm looking at long term, slow moving, dead ass boring, Bitcoin HODLing, Warren Buffet style "time in market beats timing the market" boomer gains here. My next purchase will be whenever the stock price, if ever, bottoms out. However, just because I think TSLA is overpriced doesn't mean that I'm shorting this stock either. 

&nbsp;

Amazon famously was non-profitable or barely profitable until 2015 because they were reinvesting their profits into expansion. That is what Tesla is doing right now. Remember all the analysts who continuously warned investors for over a decade to stay away from AMZN because they are unprofitable? Well, I don't see any sane analysts parroting that narrative anymore. And then its stock price shot to the moon after they enabled profit mode. It's stock price nearly doubled due to the pandemic and I'm still not planning on shorting this stock even though the pandemic will likely go away in less than a year. 

&nbsp;

I don't know how TSLA will do in the short term. Nonetheless, I do believe that Tesla has the best chance among any auto maker out there to reach a $2-10+ trillion valuation within 10 years. So I'm just going to lean back and enjoy the show.

&nbsp;

---

&nbsp;

**TL;DR**: Tesla HAS NO COMPETITION. This is as if android wasn't developed until 4 years after the iPhone was released. Do NOT short or buy puts on TSLA. Although the current run seems absolutely insane, there is some substance to hold it up and possibly keep shooting up higher

&nbsp;

---

&nbsp;

**Positions**: TSLA shares @ $415 and a bunch more with an average price of $518. No calls because my wife's boyfriend did not permit.

1. If a SPAC common stock price is at $10 and after 2 years, the founders can’t find an acquisition, will shareholders receive $10 back or less?

2. Let’s say if a SPAC raises 250m then it acquires Company X worth 1B, how will the equity interest be calculated for SPAC shareholders? 

3. If you are a retail shareholder of a SPAC, will you be informed in a vote for a potential merger?

5. If I buy in a SPAC at $15, and the SPAC transaction fails and shares are redeemed back to their shareholders, the redeemed value may just be $10 or slightly less so I will incur a loss of at least $5 per share. Is it correct?

&#x200B;

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

&#x200B;

Below is a series of **linear** chain of reasoning with known facts that lead to an outcome that is guaranteed but not priced in. The market isn't carrying the implications of known-trends to their logical conclusion (the material provider--Prysmian) and is currently undervaluing Prysmian Group. Imagine this as a chain of dominos. I will lay each one down consecutively, showing a near-future reality in which a company is set to quintuple if not 10x it's revenue over the next 10 years. 

&#x200B;

1. **EVs are going to see mass adoption**. Every automaker + Apple is trying to get in on this. BEV advantages are simply too great. It is highly likely that by 2025, 25-35% or more of new car sales will be electric. This will only continue to 2030. The average car life is [12 years](https://www.aarp.org/auto/trends-lifestyle/info-2018/how-long-do-cars-last.html#:~:text=A%20typical%20passenger%20car%20should,Lyman%2C%20chief%20analyst%20at%20TrueCar). It is likely that by 2033-2035, a majority of U.S cars are electric. 
2. **This will cause big increases in demand on the grid**. [This](https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2019/12/f69/GITT%20ISATT%20EVs%20at%20Scale%20Grid%20Summary%20Report%20FINAL%20Nov2019.pdf) **is a fantastic read--the "high" (EV adoption) scenario doesn't show 90% EVs till 2040...which smaller than what is currently happening with new EV models / State/Country bans on ICE vehicles**. The average American home uses \~33 kWh of energy per day. I own a model 3 (75kWh battery), BARELY drive (no commute) and still charge 6-7 times a month (from 20% to 80%), averaging around 13 kWh per day.  A commuter may use around 30-35 kWh per day just to drive, especially when heating the car. **For a non-commuter thats a 30-40% increase, for a daily commuter that's almost a 100% increase.** By 2025, if \~30% of the U.S. fleet is electric, that'll cause a significant increase in grid demand. More important, though, is that energy generation planning, permitting, and construction takes a long time. They have to front run this big time because generation facilities (wind/solar) take time to plan, permit, build, and hook-in (HVDC). We're already seeing an absolute renaissance in wind and its only going to keep accelerating along with the EV adoption curve. 
   1. (2B) Additionally, there are other factors behind growing grid demand: California is considering banning gas heating in new homes (Electric heating and anti-gas legislation will increase electric demand for thermal units), an increased interest in hydrogen (via electrosis, for aviation / industry)
   2. (2C) Some people think that added capacity will be curtailed because everyone will charge at night where there is bandwidth for capacity boosts from existing generation facilities. **These people are wrong**. While night-charging will *assuage* total added generation capacity requirements, there isn't enough current night (natural gas) generation capacity to meet the demand of 40-50% EVs, and (see below) its unlikely Natural Gas is gonna keep as fast as it has been, for political reasons. Additionally (1) Not everyone is going to have home charging (apartment buildings, street parking rowhomes) and thus will supercharge at work/while commuting, (2) many people aren't that disciplined to save $3-4 on a charge, (3) people will live their lives normally--charging when they need, often during the day. **A ton of added capacity is needed.** 
3. **Added capacity is likely to be green**. As of yesterday, /r/Energy had an [article](https://renewablesnow.com/news/renewables-make-71-of-new-us-power-capacity-in-11-mo-2020-727014/) showing how 71% of the added energy (8000mW wind, 6500mW solar) capacity in 2020 was renewables. This phenomenon has two causes. **(1)** Finance: Coal isn't cost competitive with solar and wind anymore. Solar is getting very, very cheap and more and more efficient. Offshore wind is having a renaissance. Nuclear is greener, but more expensive (\~$4,200 per kW), and NIMBYism will prevail. Solar/wind is FAR cheaper than $4,200 per kW right now. Banks are scared of liberals: Alaskan oil can't even get bank financing now (Just this week, Trump opened up those Alaskan areas for bidding and nobody bidded, literally), and Coal isn't expanding. People see the end of oil (and, honestly, nuclear) is near. **(2)** Politics. Dem administration for the next 4 years, and green energy isn't the political football it was 10 years ago. Fighting renewables isn't the focus of the right anymore. Additionally, Democrats resist natural gas expansion (as noted above). Natural gas isn't that green (big methane problems) and while it's cheap af, its not everywhere (pipeline limits), and I deem it unlikely that population centers (NE Corridor, Cali, Chicago, etc etc), which are ALL liberal, are going to be OK with more and more natural gas plants. I deem it unlikely that we're gonna be a 50%+ natural gas country. Don't believe me? Go read up on California banning natural gas. Yea, Cali can be crazy, but it is almost ALWAYS the harbinger of progressive thinking. Expect that to carry forward. 
4. **Biden will do an infrastructure bill**. This will happen. Its popular, its needed, and its perfect for his huge desire to be seen as a bipartisan president. Its an amazing kick off to his first year in office. He needs to find a way to boost employment before 2022 in order to have a growth-narrative for the midterms. 2022 midterms don't look good for democrats, and if he doesn't have a strong 2021 year (or at least, optically) he'll get lame ducked in 2023-2024. He's not running in 2024, he's too fucking old. So, how does he go into the twilight of his career with the narrative of a 'Unifier'? He does something everyone can get behind: infrastructure. With the recent Trump supporter capital storming, Biden has some great political bandwidth to hit the ground running. 
5. **Biden will try and include moderate green elements in this bill because he knows he won't get green policies otherwise**. Even with the two blue Georgia seats, there is \*\*ZERO\*\* chance the Dems blow the filibuster. You have (1) a president that won by a narrow margin, that (2) isn't that popular, (3) who has a bad-looking 2022 midterm, that (4) won't run in 2024 cause he's ancient, with (5) a not-too-popular VP, can't afford to run roughshod over norms and weaken their 2022 prospects. No-filibuster 50-50 plus Kamala casting the deciding vote? Please. Not happening. Yet, Biden does need to cater to his liberal supporters and fire up the DNC base in 2022. A great way to get people onboard is to blend an infrastructure bill with elements of the Green New Deal. He has to do this. Its the only way to sneak green policies into implementation to cater to the Left. Standalone 'Green New Deal' isn't happening and McConnell isn't going to let something named that pass, but may let green elements be sluffed into a general infrastructure bill. All this aside, infrastructure is *NEEDED.* Everyone and their mother knows this. It's pushing on an open door, at precisely the right time. 
6. **Green elements in an infrastructure bill will have to benefit Red states** in order to get passed. We're not gonna get a carbon tax / cap and trade system. We're not gonna get massive oil taxes. Yeah, he'll help EV adoption, but that's pretty limited to subsidies (the $7,500 subsidy expansion for Tesla and GM just failed as a line item) and research subsidies. Not good enough for the Left. 
7. **A lot of Red states are RICH in renewables**. Look at the maps below for for U.S. solar and Wind geographic advantages. What do you notice? For the most part, there are huge wind opportunities in the Midwest, Great Lakes, and NE Offshore region. There is huge solar potential across Texas and the South. Outside of California and Northeast Corridor/Great Lakes offshore wind, renewables are concentrated in the Midwest and South. **If you want to do a Green Energy bill that also serves as a bipartisan stimulus, there are geographic comparative advantages that give you a compelling reason to create green energy in Red states.**

**However, the Grid currently isn't configured to transport the level of green energy needed to meet the heightened demand environment in 2030-2040. Guess what links huge solar fields and onshore/offshore wind to population centers? HVDC does. The HVDC network to pipe "local" (regional) renewable hotspots to population centers doesn't exist. See the below map of the U.S. HVDC Grid, and compare it to Europe and China's:**

In addition to these maps, look at the [**global list of HVDC projects Wikipedia page**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HVDC_projects)**. Observe how many are in Asia/Euro vs the U.S.** It's not our fault, in the past grid owners could easily locate generation facilities near enough to minimize high voltage lines. However, things are changing--wind and solar take space, aren't as location-independent as gas/coal/nuclear. 

&#x200B;

* (8) **Microgrids won't solve the issue.** Obviously Tesla city-level distributed powerpacks will happen, but this isn't an either-or situation. **The speed of EV adoption and the heightened demand environment are going to vastly outpace the adoption of rooftop solar (what many microgrid proponents suggest can fully-deal with grid demand)**. Grid-level wind/solar is still needed, and those sources need to be connected in, so again, a regionalized HVDC connection system from renewable --> population center is still needed. 
* (9) **The more HVDC connections that are installed, the more compelling it will be to form longer-linkages (more HVDC) between population centers (and therefore, storage).** Connected regional grids (think--Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania connected mutually via Great Lakes Wind farms that are, in turn, connected to the NE Corridor) marginally decrease the amount of total net storage needed in the system, as "the wind is always blowing/sun is always shining somewhere". This process will continue until we eventually have a 'Supergrid'--but NOT one by original purpose--which is what people usually argue against when people mention that word, but convenience--alongside thousands of microgrids. 
   * If this seems extreme to you, sit back, consider the 2nd point of this post, then imagine 80% of Cars are EVs within 15 years. A vast majority of Semi-trucks are electric. Advances in batteries mean that Planes, shipping, and tons of military applications now all use huge amounts of power. Grid demand is way, WAY higher than it was when the biggest demand source were light bulbs and your shitty AC unit. 
* (10) **The way to play this is by going to the manufacturer / installer**. **Prysmian Group ($PRYMY, an ADR) is the largest HVDC provider in the world. It's also a pure play.** It is based in Milan, but its a union of 3 companies--one of which is General Cable (American), which produces HVDC domestically. See the below image, which is from Prysmian's 2019 annual report. The green dots are energy cable (HVDC) manufacturing facilities. See a trend? They're almost all in Red states (again--renewables largely in Red States, HVDC manufacturing in Red states...)

https://preview.redd.it/m5vyb46so0a61.png?width=601&format=png&auto=webp&s=202e61a596fcac6e73c1584e3a5eeec9059dec58

* (11) **45% of Prysmian's revenue is Grid work. It has a P/E of 44. What happens when Prysmian's revenue goes up by 3x over the next 5 years, and 10x by 2030?** There is SO much work to be done modernizing the U.S. grid, but then on to the rest of the world. The realities I am describing--EVs--> heightened demand --> green is cheap --> it needs to be hooked in --> regional grid connections lower net amount of storage needed in aggregate, etc etc etc, aren't unique to the first world. Other countries will follow suit. 

# Conclusion

I do not believe this reality is baked into the price. Although everyone knows grid upgrades are coming (hence 44 P/E), I don't think that people are taking these large-phenomenon down to their lower level logical-conclusions. The gradual, inadvertent development of the Supergrid is inevitable, necessary, and politically convenient for a guy so desperate to bridge the political divide. Prysmian is well suited to take full advantage of American infrastructure as well as the rest of the world. 

\------------------

TL/DR:

**EVs adoption curves are getting faster and faster, and are going to drive higher electrical demands from the Grid, which will be met with Green Energy. This will require a huge increase in HVDC installations. This is occurring at exactly the time Biden needs a big infrastructure plan for political-economic reasons, and the realities of Green energy in the U.S. actually benefit Red States pretty bigly. Gradually, HVDC networks will reach a point where a macro-regional 'Supergrids' become a reality (in order to lower aggregate storage requirements and add more safety/redundancy). $PRYMY (Prysmian Group) is the worlds largest HVDC provider and they manufacture HVDC in the U.S. They are primed to benefit from this trend, and it is currently vastly undervalued.**

I expect there to be further increases once China comes into the market for scrap this month. 

Last month we saw 3 increases - for a total of $135 - a record. 

I believe we will see scrap move up $80-100/ton for January deals.

The point Chamath Palihapitiya made about Tesla in the article linked [here](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/chamath-palihapitiya-tesla-stock-price-target-elon-musk-net-worth-2021-1-1029941932) is that Tesla is ultimately going to be (or have a large focus on) energy storage and production.

You can already see an example of this with the South Australian (South Australia is a state in...the middle south of Australia) battery storage facility that was a great test run for his proposal and also mimics the plot of one of the evil guys in a Michael Keaton Batman movie oddly enough.

>Palihapitiya said that Tesla was a "distributed energy business" and that Musk was figuring out a way to harness energy, store it, and use it to help people to be productive and fight climate change.

The point about this is that decentralised energy generation and power storage offers a lot of benefits (noticeably reduced transmission loss) and if Elon is aiming big, and he is, he may well be angling towards a "Tesla Battery in every home" style scenario which while that will open up to competition, even a fractional market share of the *entire first world housing market* would be profitable beyond belief, and especially when you consider the main thing Elon is really, really, really, really, really, good at.

Getting government money.

Due to many governments being left leaning and environmental they'll slavish lap at his space boots to be the first to give him billions to do his ~~space bullshit~~ *genius clean energy programs* and ~~if~~ *when* those programs begin to roll out for clean energy generation and storage then the resulting *revenue* is going to exceed that of Wallmart eventually, and that doesn't include the vast and staggering increase in assets held.

And one the main key points is that Elon will once again spin this out of virtually nothing, getting the staggering fuckhuge government contracts and funding with very lucrative and generous clauses right up front.

So he doesn't have to worry about waiting for a profit, the ventures will be paid for up front and *then* generate profits.

Because of the environmental regulations and tax breaks, a decent analysis and extrapolation of this alone is going to lead to revenues in excess of $500bn within fifteen years, and Elon Musk won't just be a paper trillionaire, he'll be a cold hard cash trillionaire.

This is not money spun out of nothing mind you, this is him gaining control of the energy market and emerging energy storage market which may well causes some friction, but Elon will win that battle as he will have full government support.

The drop was caused by two things: lockup period expired which tripled the float and short sellers were coming out as evidenced by the short sale reports.  

Today the insiders who wanted to sell have sold.  Institutions have increased their positions.  And there’s still a ton of short sellers that have to cover.  

A few days ago Fubo released preliminary results https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/01/06/fubotv-preliminary-q4-results-indicate-it-will-top/

They are posting huge growth well past their previous estimates.  Marketcap today is under $2B.  This is a netflix/roku type of play at the beginning.  Market is paying a premium for growth (see all EV stocks, weed stocks, etc).  Fubo has the growth and with their niche of live sports they could become involved in a bidding war if some of the major players want to add a new niche to their programming ( I’m looking at you nflx and AMZN ).  But that’s neither here nor there because I think the stock found its floor, the oversupply caused by lockup expiration and high short sales volume has dried up, and between institutions buying in and retail wanting to get in on the next netflix type of play I see this climbing back to $50 very soon.

Another iconic brand in the making. _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Schnitzer Earnings Call Review & Steel Outlook I finally had a chance to read the transcript from today’s earnings call from Schnitzer. 

Here are the key takeaways:

“global raw material prices rose to multiyear highs by the end of the quarter driven by strong recovery in automotive demand, supply chain restocking, a resilient construction market and scrap supply constraints related to COVID-19 restrictions.

More specifically, ferrous export price increases off the East Coast were positively impacted by stronger export demand for Turkish steel products. Through October, Turkey's crude steel production had increased 4.2% year-over-year as steel production returned to pre-pandemic levels to meet higher domestic and export demand while ferrous scrap imports into Turkey were up 19%. Ferrous export price increases off the West Coast were driven by strong semi-finished steel import demand from China and higher steel production in Asia.

A key global driver for the increase in West Coast ferrous export prices has been China's increasing steel demand and China's new ferrous scrap import standards, which have reclassified ferrous scrap as a recycled raw material. We expect this to create higher demand for global ferrous scrap.”

“U.S. domestic prices were underpinned by similar trends. The latest U.S. economic data reflect durable goods orders, industrial production and housing starts rising in November. Ferrous prices have now reached their highest price points in a decade. December's global auto sales doubled from their April lows and were in line with pre-pandemic levels. Current auto inventories are at 10-year lows. Container shipping is experiencing its strongest demand in at least a decade and some steel order books stretch into March and even April.”

HIGHEST PRICE POINTS IN A DECADE - closing in on 2008 levels - THIS IS HUGE - also lining up going back to my original post to kick off this entire steel series of posts. 

Current auto inventories - 10 YEAR LOW

What does that tell you?

Tells me that steel and more importantly steel stocks are going to 🚀 further and further until there is relief. 

As of now, I don’t see that coming until Fall at the earliest. 

More from the call:

“The recent sharp increases in ferrous and nonferrous prices have been driven by low inventory levels after many quarters of destocking, followed by significantly higher steel mill and smelter buy plans and production levels. There are also many LONG TERM trends that support strong and sustainable ferrous and nonferrous scrap demand including the transition to lower carbon technologies, China's elimination of quotas for nonferrous scrap imports that meet its metal content standards and the prospect of China's reemergence as an importer in the global ferrous scrap market. In a world that is seeking decarbonization, we expect recycled scrap metal to be an increasingly important metals carbon solution and for demand to accelerate.”

CHINA. CHINA. CHINA. 

Their need for steel is unquenchable at this point. 

Then you have the rest of the world - THAT ALSO NEEDS STEEL AND RAW MATERIALS. 

Back to the call:

“Global demand for recycled ferrous increased in the first quarter which was driven by continuing economic recovery, benefits of government stimulus and concerns over tight supply. Our flexible operating platform, our logistics expertise and our global sales reach, all helped us to maximize the benefits from this heightened demand. We shipped 63% of our ferrous in the quarter to the export market and we sold the remainder into the domestic market. Our top total country destinations for ferrous exports were Bangladesh, Turkey and Vietnam.”

Wait until China purchases start. 

I expect deals to be done soon and a new benchmark will be set. 

Back to earnings from the call:

“Our adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter was $40 million. This performance was up significantly from $28 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 and was quadruple the adjusted EBITDA in the prior year quarter. The combination of improved market conditions and benefits from management initiatives led to an expansion of our operating margins.

Adjusted EBITDA per ferrous ton reached $38 taking us to pre-pandemic levels last achieved in fiscal 2019. This also represented a sequential improvement of $11 per ferrous ton. Around half of that increase came from improved markets and the other half from actions we have taken. These included our commercial initiatives and productivity improvements which were enabled by our new One Schnitzer organization model and a benefit of $2 per ferrous ton from a sales contract settlement. Benefits in the quarter from average inventory accounting were approximately $2 per ton. This compared to a similar impact in the previous quarter and an adverse impact of $4 per ton in the first quarter of the prior year.”

Bottom-line Schnitzer blew past all expectations, as I had predicted. 

Paper hands sold the news. 

However, the AH market popped up again. 

This is a $50 stock in short order and has legs to reach $60. 

I think it reaches back into the low $40’s next week and possibly hits blue sky $43+ mid next week. 

The MOST IMPORTANT thing to take away from this call is that steel is reaching levels we have not seen in over a decade based on scrap and raw material costs.  

This will translate to higher steel prices = higher revenues = higher margins = higher EPS. 

2021 WILL BE A STEEL SUPER-CYCLE. 

TL,DR

I like this to hit $50 soon. 

I took a gamble and bought $40 calls expiring next week when it bottomed out late today from its highs. 

I’m betting on a bounce and then blue sky.

1) Buy a globally-diversified portfolio of smart-beta ETFs (a lot of value, quality and momentum firms).

2) Leverage the portfolio to the optimal, mathematical number that produces highest returns (about 2:1 leverage).

3 - Bonus) Sell SPX boxes to get dirt-cheap financing rates for your leverage (\~0.5% borrowing rate).

So about a month or so ago I bought 25 132$ call expiring 1/8/21 on $TIF. They were super cheap at the time (125$ total) and I honestly didn't really understand what I was doing. They were planning on releasing their earnings report late December/ early January. I thought that with the holidays and the general uncertainty of the world. People might be buying jewelry, but the real reason I bought it was because it was cheap and i'm dumb.

Well, now January 8th is tomorrow and the current stock is not showing up on Finviz, yahoo finance or Robinhood. I can see on Google Finance that the AH for TIF is 132.40 which would net me a decent profit, but I can't find the stock through my broker (Robinhood, yea RH. boo... w/e).

I've been looking through the news and discovered that TIF was bought out by LVMH recently for 16 billion, but I'm not sure where that leaves me. Will my options even show up tomorrow? or will it expire worthless. Is the recent buyout the reason why I can't see the shares anymore? Also why was $TIF not really moving at all for the past 3 months.
