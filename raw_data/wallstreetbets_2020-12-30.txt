I'm taking all my cash and moving it into SPACs. My thinking - 

&#x200B;

1. Holding cash in a low interest environment is bad. But also the market is very hot and so putting it all in the market which is potentially at the top is also bad. 
2. SPACs are just holding companies and thus won't trade below NAV (hence why always b/w $10-12). If the SPAC doesn't find a target, then you get money back with interest. Thus until a merger happens, it's almost as safe as a bank account.  
3. SPACs, especially with good sponsors (ex. Chamath, Reid Hoffman, etc), have an unfair advantage in merging with good startups. Being part of these SPACs essentially gives you a call option to be part of a good company. When merger is announced, market typically responds favorably making stock go up (just look at IPOB and IPOC) 
4. Thus putting all cash into SPACs gives you (a) no way you can lose money pre-merger, (b) opportunity to make money when good sponsor merges, (c) plenty of escape mechanisms b/c its very liquid.

It’s end of year 2021. Most people that wanted to have gotten the vaccine. Cases begin to drop rapidly, the hosipatals are becoming less crowded and lockdowns are now a thing of the past. 

Do we just go back to normal or will there be a cultural change in the way people live this lives?

Travel:
As the borders open up I believe that people will be flocking to get away. Escape from the 4 walls that have kept them safe and ultimately sheltered them from harms way. 

Airports will be slammed. Travel costs will sky rocket to make up for all the months of lost revenue they have incurred. 

Entertainment companies will be able to charge more money for tickets and people will pay. 

I do see consumer spending spiking during the first quarter post lockdown(whenever that may be)

Work life balance will forever shift. 
Companies now realize they can have employees work from home and save thousands on office related expenses. 

I also believe that people have gotten used to spending more time with the family and that some would actually prefer this. 

Online shopping has become the new norm during 2020. Every retailer in sight will have to offer some type of online experience in the next 3 years. 

Food. 
Restaurants have been hit hard in 2020. The ones that survived are most likely in for a treat. As travel and tourism industry goes on a high restaurants will directly benefit from increased foot traffic and lowered restrictions. 

Humans are social creatures. We thrive on being part of a pack and being accepted. This is literally engrained in our DNA in efforts of finding a human mate and being able to reproduce. 

All decisions always come back to basic needs of human life. 

Food/ water
Lesiure
Shelter
Family

If we look at how we have adapted in the last year we can see how all the choices we made have revolves around those 4 basic needs

Zoom became a huge hit since it provides a medium to connect with our family or for work which puts food on our table and shelter over our heads. 

Amazon because we wanted to safely provide food and necessities without being in harms way. 

Apple because it allows us to connect with our loved ones and people we care about, helps us do business which provides shelter and also games and reading leisure(and so many other things). A couple clicks and we have food at our doorstep. 

This is called a 3 banger. It satisfys 3/4 of the basic human needs.

Yes, alot of people aren't a fan that its called a Mustang, but what it does have going for it is:

1.  Tesla is its only real competition right now, (Except for Nio as well in the chinese market)
2.  Its a few grand cheaper than a Tesla, but also less features.  (Which is good because it has a hefty profit margin) 
3.  Has a nice EV credit to go with it.  (Ford can pull a tesla and sell EV credits as well)
4.  Has the Ford distribution chain, which is 10x larger than Tesla, with more reach.
5.  Ford will have 0 issues with production like Tesla tends to have
6.  It will be selling globally in 2021, so massive potential in China, especially since nobody in China knows what a "Mustang" car is and its significance so it won't have the same branding issues like it does in America.
7. Produced in Mexico so it has a better Margin than Tesla.  
8.  It obviously isn't going to cannibalize their own sales in anyway, but will take away from Tesla.

Looking down at the haters form the moon. Next stop mars. 🚀 🚀 🚀 _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $MP == Must Play --> MP Materials DD Here’s what’s up. For the next energy/tech economy to manifest we’re going to need a lot of “Rare Earth Elements” (REEs; meme potential endless 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 ). REEs are used in most high-end consumer electronics, advanced renewable energy tech, and energy storage tech these days. REEs Neodymium and Praseodymium are critical to the manufacture of strong magnets 🧲 for turbines (wind, hydro, gas, etc), and EVs, due to their high efficiency and high energy density. REEs such as Dysprosium are used to increase the operating temperature of the magnets  for high-temp applications. Other REEs are used in the production of smart phones, hard disk drives, military defense systems, and even medical equipment. OK, you get it, they’re useful, and used A LOT. So, what’s the big deal?

The majority of REE production is concentrated in just two countries: China (85%) and Australia (\~10%), with the rest scattered around the world (Russia, Brazil, India, etc). “In 2010 China significantly restricted their rare earth exports. That was done to ensure a supply of rare earths for domestic manufacturing and for environmental reasons. This shift by China triggered panic buying, and some rare earth prices shot up exponentially.” – Geology.com. As the demand for the above tech increases, so will the demand for REEs.  🚀🚀🚀 

How rare are REEs? Honestly, it depends on the element in question. The main factor that puts them into this category isn’t necessarily their abundance, it’s the economics of extraction. They’re difficult to find in concentrations that are worth mining and processing. This decreases supply and drives up the price, causing them to be effectively “rare.” Why mention this, you ask?

Because the money is to be found in **new raw ore processing/recycling technologies**. So we need better ways to extract REEs from raw ore, and we need better ways to recycle the REEs that are tied up in waste-tech. We’re at a point with our tech consumption that we’ve all probably had at least 1 old smart phone; chances are you’ve had 3-4 at this point. Currently, companies cannibalize the phones for useful parts, refurb, or throw them away. But this is a HUGE waste of REEs. Additionally, currently, there are no commercial capabilities to separate and process HREEs outside of China.

**Enter MP Materials ($MP)–** the only owner of an active REE mine in the US. They recently went public and have been on a steady climb since (up 100% in \~6wks), but I see more room to run. They also recently announced plans to have operational separation capabilities by the end of 2020 (no news as of 12/30). Having an operational REE mine is a HUGE deal,  since the development of additional mines in the US has been stymied. China can (and will) manipulate the prices to make further mine development uneconomical, but they can’t price MP out of production entirely (esp with the US gov’t backing them). They hold investment contracts with the DoD related to these separation technologies as it’s seen as pertaining to national security.  🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Did a quick search for other DDs on MP; I believe these are complimentary to mine and not redundant.

**Additional companies to keep an eye on:**

**Lynas Corporation $LYSCY** (market cap \~$2.7B) – Australian REE mining company (close global ally of US). Has MOUs with smaller US companies aiming to develop HREE separation and processing capacity in Texas. 

**AMG Critical Materials Company** (market cap \~$840M) – Lithium and silicon production, sub of much larger company with innovative manufacturing/R&D etc.

**Texas Mineral Resources** (market cap $124M) – also opening a pilot plant in the US for separating REEs, ore sourced from US.

**Rare Earth Element Ltd**  (market cap \~$115M) - developing mine in Wyoming for HREEs. Rare Element Resources is developing separation and processing capabilities with proprietary technology. Pilot demonstration of separations tech in Canada and Germany.

**Ucore Rare Metals** (market cap $33M)- developing mine in AK for HREEs (come online in 3-4 years). Building pilot plant in US for separating LREEs and HREEs 

**Private, non-traded companies:**

**Momentum Technologies**  – has capabilities to produce Rare Earth Oxides (not previously mentioned) from a variety of feedstocks (raw and recycled).

**Electron Energy Company** – manufactures samarium cobalt magnets, actively stockpiles rare earth metals to prevent supply disruption – carrying between six to twelve months supply.

 These materials such as Neodymium are used for batteries in EVs, drones, and pretty much everything that is powered by electricity. 

       China is dominating this market right now with about 85% of the market share. MP materials is currently the only rare earth mining company in north america, and controls almost the entire remaining 15%

As you may know, the US, as well as many other countries, has been trying to be more financially independent from china, and the Pentagon recently gave MP materials funding to expand mining in california. The global market for rare earth materials is expected to 10x by 2025 and with relations shaky between China and the US along with other major countries this means that the rest of the world cannot rely on just china for these extremely important materials and even if relations are repaired with China, they won't be able to supply even close to 85% of the global supply in the future. This means there has to be a significant amount of the market controlled by north america by 2025, and MP materials is the only option for north america because new competitors will be years behind MP as it takes at least a year just to gain permits, let alone scale the company into a large enough one to compete with an established company like MP that has the support of the US government.

 With the global market expected to rise into the hundreds of billions and MP in a position to gain a large portion of the market over the next couple years, this is a once in a generation opportunity similar to investing in the only north american oil company as the first oil combustion vehicles were rolled out in the late 19th century. 
  
MP IPOd just this year and many people aren't even aware they are public. They are trading at around $30 with just a $5.16B market cap as of market close on Tuesday, and have just seen a nice dip in price in just the last week after nearly tripling over the last 2 months. 

This is the perfect opportunity to invest in the EV industry as a whole and a company that could be sitting well over 100B within just the next few years.

(OR BUY IF YOU HAVENT) _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ okay fellow autists. im with you. _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Its a Boomer play, but its guaranteed money: $GE Leaps  So, this DD isn't actual TA. It is a series of (what I believe) are **very** safe assumptions: a combination of political analysis, energy trends, and inevitable nation-wide "**must have**" investments. WARNING: this is long. By necessity, one assumption leads to another. I'll give you the **one sentence TLDR** up front, but because this is an assumption-chain, I encourage you to read this post

\----

TL/DR: 

**In order for Biden to get a quick win for what is looking like unfavorable (to Dems) 2022 midterms, he will first shoot for a massive infrastructure bill. Either way Georgia goes, Dems won't blow up the filibuster. Therefore, if he wants to have any "green" policies in his first term, he has to make it super amenable to Republicans. (1) Connecting \*\*rich\*\* renewable areas (mostly Republican states) by extensive HVDC lines to (2) an enhanced nationwide Grid (HVDC lines) will kill two birds with one stone. This \^ infrastructure is inevitable, either way. $GE is the #1 and only American HVDC provider, 220k workers +. $GE Renewables don't contribute to revenue right now, but HVDC + Wind (which will be yuge) make it a massive discount rn.** 

\-----

I am going to lay down a series of linear assumptions and realities below. I feel like these assumptions are all safe, therefore, it is highly likely that the outcome I describe comes to fruition within the next 4 years. 

1. **EVs are going to see mass adoption**. Every automaker + Apple is trying to get in on this. BEV advantages are simply too great. It is highly likely that by 2025, 30% or more of the U.S. fleet will be electric. This will only continue to 2030. 

2. **This will cause big increases in demand on the grid**. Go google around: Grid owners are ecstatic about this. The average American home uses \~33 kWh of energy per day. I own a model 3, and BARELY drive (i dont commute) and still use \~10kWh per day for driving. A commuter may use around 30-35 kWh per day just to drive. By 2025, if \~30% of the U.S. fleet is electric, that'll cause a significant increase in grid demand. More important, though, is that energy generation investment takes time. Grid owners know this is coming. They will beef up generation faster and faster as the U.S. economy becomes more **electrified** instead of based on fossil fuels. 

3. **Added capacity is likely to be green**. This has 2 causes. (1) Finance: Coal isn't cost competitive with solar and wind anymore. Solar is getting very, very cheap and more and more efficient. Offshore wind is having a renaissance. Nuclear is greener, but more expensive (\~$4,200 per kW), and NIMBYism will prevail. Solar/wind + batteries is cheaper than $4,200 per kW right now. Additionally, Alaskan oil can't even get bank financing now, and Coal isn't expanding. People see the end is near. (2) Politics. Dem administration for the next 4 years, and green energy isn't the political football it was 10 years ago. Fighting renewables isn't the focus of the right anymore. Additionally, Democrats resist natural gas expansion: remember the Keystone pipeline? Natural gas is pretty green and cheap af, but its not everywhere, and I deem it unlikely that population centers (NE Corridor, Cali, Chicago, etc etc) are going to be OK with more and more natural gas plants. I deem it unlikely that we're gonna be a 50%+ natural gas country. 

4. **Biden will do an infrastructure bill**. This will happen. Its popular, its needed, and its perfect for his huge desire to be seen as a bipartisan president. 

5. **Biden will try and include moderate green elements in this bill because he knows he won't get green policies otherwise**. Even if the two Georgia seats go blue, there is \*\*ZERO\*\* chance the Dems blow the filibuster. You have (1) a president that won by a narrow margin, that (2) isn't that popular, (3) who has a bad-looking 2022 midterm, that (4) won't run in 2024 cause hes ancient, with (5) a not-too-popular VP, can't afford to run roughshod over norms and weaken their 2022 prospects. 50-50 plus Kamala casting the deciding vote? Please. Not happening.

6. **Green elements in an infrastructure bill will have to benefit Red states** in order to get passed. We're not gonna get a carbon tax / cap and trade system. We're not gonna get massive oil taxes

7. **A lot of Red states are RICH in renewables**. Look at these maps ([https://www.nrel.gov/gis/solar.html](https://www.nrel.gov/gis/solar.html)) for U.S. solar, and this map ([https://energy.maryland.gov/Pages/Info/renewable/windmaps.aspx](https://energy.maryland.gov/Pages/Info/renewable/windmaps.aspx)) for U.S. wind. What do you notice? For the most part, **there are huge wind opportunities in the Midwest**. **There is huge solar potential across Texas and the South**. Outside of California and Northeast Corridor offshore wind, renewables are concentrated in the Midwest and South. 

8. **Right now, we can't take full advantage of these areas because the infrastructure to transport 2025-2030 sized energy demands to population centers don't exist**. This is key. Right now, the U.S. energy grid is largely disconnected in terms of HVDC lines (high voltage lines capable of transmitting huge amounts of power with minimal loss: it resembles small, little fiefdoms. Google "U.S. HVDC Map" (make sure you're looking at the current ones--not the projections). We don't have that much HVDC infrastructure. In this past, there wasn't a huge emphasis because there wasn't that much need....renewables price efficiency didn't make for THAT compelling of a need, and localized Grid owners made-do with the status quo. **HVDC network improvement is INEVITABLE.** Renewables are too cheap, and the efficiencies inherent in concentrating wind and solar where appropriate are too vast. Right now, as you read this, there is an UNDERSEA Ultra HVDC cable being laid between Australia and Singapore to transport solar power. I shit you not. Europe and China are building vast HVDC and Ultra HVDC lines right now. **Look at this wiki page:** [**https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_HVDC\_projects**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HVDC_projects)**. See how many are in Asia/Euro vs the U.S.? Its a fucking joke.** It is extremely unlikely that we're gonna just slap solar and wind where they are sub-optimal, rather than seek greater ROI. Mass HVDC lines are inevitable. 

9. General Electric is the only large American HVDC provider. GE employs 200,000+ Americans. It is literally one of the oldest American companies. It has a super American brand name, and is politically connected. 

10. HVDC is **expensive**. I'm not an expert, but because of NIMBY, its likely that a lot of HVDC will be buried along rail lines (From what I read). HVDC between hundreds of wind/solar fields across the U.S. will need to be built, plus HVDC / Ultra HVDC between renewable zones to NE Corridor, Chicago, California. I'd google around for figures, but basically, its $$$$$$$$$. 

11. **Right now,** General Electric's Renewables sector barely brings in any revenue (17% 2019 revenue, around $15 billion [https://www.statista.com/statistics/245430/revenue-of-general-electric-by-segment/#:\~:text=Aviation%20and%20power%20are%20the,U.S.%20dollars%20one%20year%20before](https://www.statista.com/statistics/245430/revenue-of-general-electric-by-segment/#:~:text=Aviation%20and%20power%20are%20the,U.S.%20dollars%20one%20year%20before).). The new CEO is actually pretty fucking great ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H.\_Lawrence\_Culp\_Jr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._Lawrence_Culp_Jr)). He turned Danaher around, and is setting up GE for success. GE has a TON of debt (debt/equity above 6.0), but what will happen to the stock when GE is given absolutely gigantic contracts in order to buff up the U.S. Grid? They really are the only American company with the production/size ability to do this. What happens when the GE Renewables sector grows by 4-5x over the next 10 years? Grid improvements + Wind turbines are going to go up bigly. That $15 billion revenue line item may increase dramatically. 

If you read this far, let me restate that this isn't TA. I don't have strikes for you. I don't know how to value HVDC and Wind over the next decade. However, I have a **STRONG** feeling in my nips that $GE is going to be a major American comeback story, and \^ that political/economic/renewable trends make it exceedingly likely that GE will have huge grid contracts coming up. **How much of this is already baked into the price? I have no idea, but I do know that the big boys don't gamble on Adderall rantings like this, so it probably isn't baked in.** 

I'm using GE to add some safety to my current 100% TSLA portfolio. I encourage you all to pick up at least a few cheap 2022 GE Leaps. I'm buying the furthest out, highest strike calls I can get._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Preparing for inflation and economic downfall of US: investing in gold ETFs vs shorting the US market Because the US economy is fragile evermore than before and because the world economy is in a downturn, the US' quantitative easing strategy might no longer work since the government will no longer be able to sell their debt to developing countries to match the inflation within the US market.

I've only been investing since November of 2018 and only started trading since August of this year so I don't have much personal reference. But I keep hearing things like, "this year is a bubble" "this year is better than usual" "If you're not 400x your portfolio this year you should quit". However, the S&P 500 is up %15 this year. Which is only the 3rd highest out of the last 5 years, so it doesn't seem that special.

It seems like a good year, but the way everyone is talking it seems like I should be scared for much, much worse to be the "normal". Am I missing something, what is so special about this year, or is it that the pandemic was such a big crash that the rebound is what was so special?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ What will it take to change GME shorts investment thesis? As a GME holder, been thinking about what will have to happen to cause shorts to change their investment thesis. Part of it could be a change in timeline, if GME lasts 5+ years rather than the 1-2 years shorts expected, that could be enough to change an investment thesis. Another is that regardless of timeline, shorts probably compare GME to Blockbuster and no matter how long, it's gonna be toast. So even though GME is undervalued right now they obviously do need a strategy for a long-term position in the gaming industry with games becoming more digital.

Maybe they create an E-sports gaming hub? Maybe they successfully transition to being an online gaming retailer with a new strategic partnership with Microsoft? With the promising 200+% online sales growth, there's a real chance the 2nd option could happen without a major change.

So to the GME shorts lurking, what would it take for y'all to change your thesis?  Also what're y'all gonna do if/when the comparison goes from Blockbuster to Netflix?

\*\*Edit: Just to clarify, the Netflix comparison is a metaphor for a successful pivot in a changing industry._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ GME Shorts vs Hedge Fund Margin Does anyone have an idea of roughly what % of a hedge funds assets they would keep freed up to use for margin?  It seems like they would keep most of it invested so that it's being useful and making money.  The thing is as GME's price increases the amount of margin required to keep that short position is getting pretty huge.  If we assume they have to keep 130% of the shares value in margin, at a price point of $22 (about the highest it's gotten recently) that would take \~2 billion in margin to keep that position open.  Melvin Capital for instance has roughly 20 billion in positions on their 13F-HR.  Now this short position could be spread over a few people, but I think there's a reasonable chance it isn't.  Think about it, as it became clear that gme wasn't going away anyone with a smaller position would have unwound it because they knew melvin would be forced to keep it from mooning.

I'm here to tell you what has changed since then. Everything is in these two articles: [Bloomberg](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/12/30/does-113-for-this-merger-between-two-cannabis-heav/?source=eptyholnk0000202&utm_source=yahoo-host&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article), [The Motley Fool](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/12/30/does-113-for-this-merger-between-two-cannabis-heav/?source=eptyholnk0000202&utm_source=yahoo-host&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article). Because you autists have the attention span of a chimpanzee, I'll give an executive summary.

1. **Juicy merger for super dank weed company**  
On the 16th of December, Aphria and Tilray announced that they will merge to form the 2nd biggest exchange traded company of the cannabis market. They will form under Tilray's ticker, but Aphria stock owners will get a 62% stake in Tilray while current Tilray owners will keep a 38% stake. This will allow them to cut costs and get even stronger financials. The merger is expected to happen in the second quarter of 2021.
2. **Cannabis is still an attractive growth market**  
A lot of people are sceptical for cannabis since the last few years the stock has jumped up and down a few times through cycles of hype and disillusion. This time, all the cards are laid out right. Aphria is based in Canada, Tilray in USA: North-America is getting addicted. Boomer orange man has obstructed the market, but Sleepy Joe loves his cannabis so we're good for atleast the next 4 years.   
It's not just NA either, in the EU medicinal cannabis use and other legal CBD products are getting more and more popular, which implies an enormous growth opportunity. Tilray is already partnered with AB Inbev for CBD drinks and Aphria had acquired a sweet drink company (see last post) so they will fit together perfectly. Year after year, performance improves and astonishing growth rates can be found in financial reports (also see last post).
3. **Stock price is cheap, perfect time to get in**  
I jumped in with that last post a bit prematurely (30 shares @ 8.74), the stock price has gone down more than 20% since then. This is because of [🌈🐻 bears that are shorting the cannabis market massively and losing](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cannabis-short-sellers-now-down-155011384.html?),  $236.9 million total in short interest for APHA . It's time to beat them to the ground once again, like WSB is doing right now with GME.  
Currently APHA is noted at around $7, [analysts](https://money.cnn.com/quote/forecast/forecast.html?symb=apha) predict a median price target of $8.64 in the next year (+24%). None of the analysts are giving negative advice, it's all positive with most of them on a 'buy' advice. All of these advices are pretty conservative, weed stock is pretty volatile so the minute good news comes in through the merger or Biden administration you should expect big gains. I would project the price to reach 2017/2018 prices again if you guys diamond hand the fuck out of this stock.

**TL:DR** I'm passing you guys the boof on this massive gain opportunity. APHA is cheap atm and has good forecasts in the future with upcoming merger and Biden administration (+ worldwide growth opportunities). Let's reach another dimension with this stock.

I worked on this yesterday so I figured I'd share. I did some analysis on the Commitments of Traders weekly report data found [here](https://www.cftc.gov/MarketReports/CommitmentsofTraders/HistoricalCompressed/index.htm). It gets released every Friday for the prior week.

It basically tracks inflows and outflows of commodity and S&P futures, segmented by Dealers, Asset Managers, and Leveraged Funds. 

**Hypothesis**

The theory was that perhaps looking at the Dealer Short Position compared to the 52 or 26 week average could highlight periods when the dealers are going short while everyone else is still long, on the assumption that Dealers have the most information. If true, one could size up/down depending on likelihood of turmoil when the short position is above 150%.

I pulled in all the data, cleaned it, calculated a "Dealer Short Rank" which is their current short position / 52 week average, much like Implied Vol Rank on options, and graphed vs the SPX. 

**Results**

Ultimately, it was a leading indicator for the 2020 crash and 2008 crash but otherwise did poorly as a leading indicator, especially in the 2016-2018 period. See [here](https://i.imgur.com/dNoEFZr.png) for a chart. 

Looking at asset manager / institutional short rank at least does moderately well at identifying 'bottoms' in crashes when it reaches over 150%, as seen in [this chart](https://i.imgur.com/oHEPOTS.png).

Short positions for leveraged funds just look like noise and don't seem insightful. 

There's a bunch of other data there that I haven't looked at yet, but in terms of additional position data as well as all the other commodities and treasuries, so maybe there's an uncovered gem there, but initially seems useless.


**TLDR**: *Can't* easily piggyback on Dealer knowledge to know when to short. *Can* follow Institutional buyers out of a crash though. When they're the most short, you can start buying._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Remember DKNG?? That meme stock from ages ago?? Well, get ready for the second coming of the meme. DKNG is my favorite reopening play. Why the fuck did everyone forget about DKNG? This got pumped up over $60 a couple months ago and has shown a steady rebound since falling back to a low of around $35 on 11/2. For about a month now, there has been some nice consolidation and it appears to be ready for another breakout soon. It looks like resistance is soon going to meet support while the RSI is also showing slightly on the oversold side.

So what caused the first coming of this stock to meme? Sports coming back. What will cause the second coming of the meme? Sports returning to stability and normalcy. I already have shares and I like May 21 call options here for a couple reasons. There are a few key upcoming catalysts occurring that lead up to late May:

1. Super Bowl
2. March Madness
3. NBA Playoffs
4. MLB season getting into full swing (yeah, yeah, I don't care if you watch baseball or not people bet on it)
5. Athletes getting vaccinated
6. Forward looking to a normal NFL season with fans packed into the stands.

2021 Projected Revenue: 750-850B (45% increase from 2020).

Upcoming states that should receive good news in terms of legislation to pass mobile sports betting (Includes NY and MA): [https://www.pilotonline.com/gambling/sns-actnet-states-watch-sports-betting-legalization-2021-new-york-20201229-vdtlixrz2vecjadi7y2xljnjta-story.html](https://www.pilotonline.com/gambling/sns-actnet-states-watch-sports-betting-legalization-2021-new-york-20201229-vdtlixrz2vecjadi7y2xljnjta-story.html)

These are all positive catalysts going forward. Athletes finally getting vaccinated will be a massive catalyst which is why DKNG could be one of the best reopening plays out there. We're only scratching the surface here with sports betting. The vaccine plus more positive legislation should catapult this shit to Saturn.

Your energy is incredible. Look how far we’ve come from August. And the 🌈🐻 remain more fucked now than ever before. 💎🥜.

I won’t rehash the whole story—if you can read you already know it. If you can’t, you’ve watched plenty of epic memes & videos that convinced you to use your Wendy’s paycheck to buy 13 shares. 

Now, what many of you don’t know is how the fuck there can be more than 100% of shares short. Well, I had wondered the same thing many months ago when this shit blew up during the Hestia-Permit proxy fight this Spring. So I’m just here to drop some knowledge about share lending:

1.	⁠GTC limit orders don’t do shit to inhibit lendability. GET IT THROUGH YOUR HEADS. While your beautiful $420.69 limit may give you a chub, it don't mean shit for share lending.
2.	⁠Shares held in cash accounts can only be lent with your explicit permission (e.g. enrollment into a lending program like @ IBKR, Schwab, etc.). When this starts going berserk they will reach out and offer you low at first, eventually ridiculous annualized interest rates to opt in. I had both Schwab and IBKR emailing and CALLING (who the fuck does that?) me to lend my shares. Look at the historical interest rates at IBKR (https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME) during the proxy recall this Spring as a proof point. 200%+ annualized interest! This is some loan shark shit! The shorts held on then because who TF is terrified of Hestia-Permit, two institutions who you never heard of before either until this saga. This time it’s Ryan “my motherfucking poodle Tylee will shit on you” Cohen. The game has changed (https://g.co/kgs/xd9uRV)
3.	⁠Shares held in a margin account can and will be lent, unless you are NOT using any margin and the position is fully cash secured. Now, even with this in mind shady brokers (looking at you Robinhood, WeBull, Fidelity, etc.) have in their hypothecation agreements that they’ll always be lending shares held in margin accounts. EVERY SHARE BOUGHT ON MARGIN IS ANOTHER SHARE LENT OUT. Those prime broker fuckers are frothing at the mouth to lend all shares (even synthetic ones) that exist (and then some, thanks to synthetic longs—see S3 Partners’ Ihor Dusaniwsky’s excellent writeup here that specifically discusses GME: https://www.shortsight.com/short-interest-of-float-2-0/ ). They’ve been doing it for years (see my Twitter (RodAlzmann) for some charting on the shares short vs. price vs. short interest on max and other charts) and will gladly keep making $$$ off your shares.

That is all. Godspeed, GameStop. And praise be to the GME Gang as we fight for our hard earned tendies! The market is opening in one minute, crush the upvote and reeeeeee in the comments!!!

TL;DR: If you’re buying shares on margin you’re giving the shorts free lending ammunition. If you want to ensure you have voting rights to your shares contact your broker, or move shares held in a margin account to a cash account._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ CRSR: Why the next earnings report and the PE ratio after is going to be the deciding factor Ive seen a few DDs on this stock, but all of them have ignored the horrendous PE ratio, which is currently sitting at 85x compared to the average of about 20x for other companies in the industry. Other than this, all the fundamentals are pretty good. I think this is mostly responsible for the large price fluctuations it’s seeing, and it’s also giving alot of professional analysts a hard time finding a fair value, some as low as $24 and as high as $60. 

With the holidays and people generally being locked inside, I think it’s safe to say that the next earnings report will skyrocket compared to the last one. Personally I think CRSR could shoot up to the high 40’s or maybe even the mid 50’s after earning release, then fall after. I think it may be a good idea to exit shortly after the next earnings report (or maybe shortly before depending on how much the hype is). If you want less risk, buy shares and hold in case earnings goes tits up because this definitely is going to see good long term growth in the next few years. 

TL;DR: Next earnings report will probably lower PE ratio by alot, shooting the price up. Probably a good idea to sell shortly after because it might dip, especially with a good chance the next couple reports will be lower.

Einen guten Rutsch ins neue Jahr ihr Gehirnamputierten! (Slide good into the new year you degenerates!)_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Stock Market News for Today | INTC, PTON, AAPL, HD, LULU & other stock market updates [12-30] **Should you get into stocks that benefit from the booming housing market? Is the workout at home trade done? Intel stops the bleeding while Apple loses lawsuit. Let’s talk about this and other stock market news**

Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let’s start with the recap of yesterday, as we saw all 3 big indexes closing the day in the red despite hitting intraday records, with the [NASDAQ COMPOSITE](https://ibb.co/PCN8dwz) losing .38%, while both the broad market [SP500](https://ibb.co/cDjpNKP) and the [DOW JONES](https://ibb.co/RydQj61) Industrial finished the day down just over .2% as we also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/44wGzR0) rising by more than 4% yesterday as the $2000 stimulus was [BLOCKED](https://ibb.co/WFNSpCH) in the Senate by McConnell and the Georgia Senate runoff election is just a week away.

Almost 70% of the [COMPANIES](https://ibb.co/LYM4JfL) were declining yesterday on below average volume as the number of companies that were trading above the 50-day moving average fell under 70% for the first time in quite a while.

We saw 9 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/GRJSmht) closing in the red yesterday, with only the Health Care and Consumer Discretionary sectors having small gains as almost all the types of companies were losing ground [YESTERDAY](https://ibb.co/7tKPyP4), especially the small-caps with the small-cap growth group losing more than 2%.

Here is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/KjVsn9X) from yesterday, it’s mostly red, with only a couple of companies that were gaining big like the Chinese companies alongside Amazon and Intel.HEAT

We also got some economic data yesterday, as a review of the 2020 aviation and air travel [ESTIMATED](https://ibb.co/hRbYxpG) that traffic will be down 67% since last year, dropping to levels not seen since 1999, as air travel is still struggling to come back after the march bottoms. This has affected most of the [COMPANIES](https://ibb.co/FBq4g37) worldwide but it seems that China airlines is doing somewhat better with the biggest percentage of the total number of flights completed compared to last year.

The SP Home price [INDICES](https://ibb.co/W67RBYh) also came in better than expected with the National Index increasing by 1.4% M/M, as this is a leading measure of real estate prices, gaining 8.4% nationwide over year ago.

These moves can also be seen in the latest Redfin report, as home sales [PRICES](https://ibb.co/CwR5H56) are up 14% year/year to over $320K with a great increase in pending [SALES](https://ibb.co/mJtrwV9) which are also up more than 34% since last year, as the number of active [LISTINGS](https://ibb.co/vVkfMMh) of home sales is down more than 30%, as buyers can’t snatch them up quick enough with such low [YIELDS](https://ibb.co/7j1kY3s), as this has led for the [AVERAGE](https://ibb.co/gzQq8Wb) sale price to list value to rise to 99.4% which Is up 1.5% since 2019. This should be good news for companies like Toll Brothers, Lennar, HD and LOW.

This was also accompanied by the great numbers in the us chain store sales [NUMBERS](https://ibb.co/4PykPcH), which rose by almost 9% y/y with December sales expected to rise almost 5% since last year and a .2% increase since last month.

While [TODAY](https://ibb.co/8N3YMPV) we start the day with MBA Mortgage applications, home sales and the Chicago PMI alongside advance reads on many other data points.

In some other stock market [NEWS](https://ibb.co/q1J6Snv), we saw Apple cool of a little yesterday, losing more than 1% for the day while they also lost a lawsuit aimed of stopping Corellium using virtual iPhone for security researching in the operating system, while [INTEL](https://ibb.co/3vvXFGT) finally got a breather and recovered some of the recent loses, after an activist hedge fund manager pushed for strategic changes in the company as Intel is losing market share and top designers, with the company also [ISSUING](https://ibb.co/WgtwTrY) a statement that lifted spirits around the stock.

We also saw the [FAA](https://ibb.co/6rJ6bHd) introduce new rules for drones, this may have a big impact on companies like UPS, Walmart and Amazon, as all of them have started trials for drone-delivery, as this could lead to better margins for the companies.

The Fed also [EXTENDED](https://ibb.co/cxV3HkC) the main street lending programs until Jan. 8 with the approval of Mnuchin as they try to process a bunch of applications this month, this means we can get even more money put into the economy and eventually the stock markets which is good news.

And meanwhile, AstraZeneca’s vaccine was [APPROVED](https://ibb.co/y5QWbmh) for emergency use in the UK, this is another weapon to find this freaking illness, while JNJ will give us some results in early 2021 and Novavax just started their trial in the US.

Also, one last piece of data that I found recently shows that there was indeed a huge spike this [YEAR](https://ibb.co/JrKw01B) in the move to live streaming video and pre-recorded videos this year, as this has boosted companies like Peloton, Lululemon and others.

But this trend is seen slowing down in the next years with just a 4% [CAGR](https://ibb.co/HGhFJXS) in the equipment market, but that the exercise apps will see a big [GROWTH](https://ibb.co/02wm273) in the next years, so there are 2 different POV. I wouldn’t stay invested in companies like PTON right now, I’d rather take profits and move to other areas in the stock market. But don’t rush into companies like which have diluted their stock a lot or have lots of debt… this will not recover so fast...

Let’s hope for a good day in the market as US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/nbV49Bs) seem to be pointing at a good open, with all 3 big indexes in the green as the Nasdaq is leading the way.

FEYE stock took a massive hit a few weeks ago when the Sunburst hacking was revealed. Obviously, many cybersecurity companies including FireEye did not live up to their standards during the scandal. Too bad, I know.

Things quickly took a different turn when investors realized cybersecurity companies will see strong demand for their products and services in the wake of these types of threats. The stock has been on a tear over the last couple of weeks, and that is not the most important and interesting news either.

What I like most about the company is how it is shifting from a product-based company to a subscription-based cybersecurity company. There is a very long way to go, and the company is not yet profitable. But the free cash flow profile is promising. 

As a risk-seeking investor, I find FEYE appealing at the current market price but I believe things depend on a lot on the risk appetite of an investor.

Apple [AAPL] Stock Price Target & Analysis Stocks **Should You buy Apple stock or has the company run out of growth opportunities? What is my price prediction for Apple in the next years? Read until the end as I reveal my price target for Apple and also what I think will happen in the next couple of days, weeks & months!**

**\~ Warning! Very Very Long Post\~**

Hello everyone! So, let’s go over some of the latest news on Apple before moving on to some fundamental and technical analysis, predictions and my price target for the stock in the next years.

So, let’s start with the [news](https://postimg.cc/Xrkwk6rP) that Apple will cut the App Store commission in half for small app developers starting in the next days, this will impact developers who earn less than $1M annually from the App Store Sales. This is likely to lead to a small decline in commission revenues for Apple as around 98% of the app developers will qualify for this tax reduction from 30% to 15%, but all these small developers only contribute to about 5% of the estimated $50B in annual revenues from the App Store, so that would be only a $1.25B loss for the company, that is less than half a % of the company’s total net sales in the last fiscal year.

Also, these changes may lead to a potential long-term revenue boost, as it is likely this will lead to an increasing creation of apps which will generate more commissions in return.

Alongside this we also saw the company releasing the new MacBook’s with their first in-house [chip](https://postimg.cc/vc39NF7x), which promises faster video and imaging processing [times](https://postimg.cc/CR5Fmj5V), with both [CPU](https://postimg.cc/Y4yLdrMd) and [GPU](https://postimg.cc/xJz8gLsd) performance up to 2 times faster than the latest PC laptop chip using just a fraction of the power consumption, with both of the macbooks promising big improvements in [battery](https://postimg.cc/1fp6y1rz) life. Apple is also [expected](https://postimg.cc/GHrtJ8vc) to roll out even more in-house chips in future products, as they have started the 2-year breakup with Intel chips.

We also saw Morgan Stanley [upgrading](https://postimg.cc/bZ5qMsSS) their base case to $191 at the end of November, as they have cited record lead times, supply chain forecasts and carriers demand as they expect that the company will sell around 270M iPhone in fiscal year 2021, that’s 50M more than the consensus and almost 30M more than the previous estimate of Morgan Stanley, with an average selling price of 842$, 9% more than the base case, as people tend to chose the more expensive and high tech versions of the lineup in this new 5G cycle.

The 5G super-cycle, which I believe is on the way, and will continue in the next years, as 5G become more available worldwide, could still be the biggest thing coming right away for the company with 5G smartphones [expected](https://postimg.cc/LJptP88f) to surpass 4G sales by 2024, with the average sale price of the 5G phones also coming down, helping them become more popular.

They also [released](https://postimg.cc/PpWhPy31) an update iPad Pro and an all-new iPad Air in September which will also boost sales in this work-from-home environment that will keep the demand very high for this kind of products, just like the Macs. Alongside the increasing demand from the Wearables, Home & Accessories that include Air Pods, Apple TV, Apple Watch, and many more products.

But the biggest reasons I believe Apple is poised for continued growth, is primarily due to its services business, as they start to have more and more services like the Apple ONE [BUNDLE](https://postimg.cc/4777MD3s), which include up to 6 services from (Apple Music, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, Apple News+, the new Apple Fitness+ and the iCloud service) for a pretty reasonable price in my opinion [starting](https://postimg.cc/BLkDnqzj) from 15$ up to 30$/month, this could be a great option for families and even individuals who use their services a lot.

The latest services, [Fitness+](https://postimg.cc/cKV4KrsG) just launched in the past days, and is a direct competitor to the likes of Peloton, as the service is available on the iPhone, iPad or even Apple TV. This also makes consumers buy the Apple Watch which syncs to the other devices to show you all kinds of information. The Fitness+ app just on its own is 8$/month or 80$/year which is less expensive than Peloton subscription which charges 13$ or even traditional gyms like Planet Fitness at 10$/month.

I think this will be the fastest growing sector for the company, as this aligns with the new macro trends, as the world is moving more and more to a digital approach to almost everything as consumer preferences, with more & more younger people reaching the point in life when they use these services start to align to this increasing digital approach.

We also shouldn’t forget the Apple Card & Apple Pay service among many others which also seem to gain from the move to digital & contactless payments, as this has been accelerated due to the current situation in the past year.

And one last piece of [news](https://postimg.cc/k6BKCVTr), and the most recent one, is that Apple may have fast-tracked the Titan project. The Titan project is targeting a 2024 or 2025 push to develop an electric vehicle with advanced battery technologies, that will deliver significant increases in range at much lower costs than the current technologies while also having self-driving capabilities.

It’s reported they will not use the same technology as Tesla Full-Self-Driving feature, but will use LIDAR sensors, similar to those that we can find in the latest iPhone 12 PRO.

I think Apple can go 2 ways with this project, they can either use the huge amount of cash the company has to buy another car-maker like Ford, GM or any other car manufacturer expect Tesla and Toyota which do have a big market cap, so that they can fast-track the potential manufacturing of cars, or they can enter into a partnership with big companies like Tesla, Volkswagen or any other car marker to either produce cars or license their technology to this other car-makers which would ultimately and probably have higher margin-returns than the actual manufacturing of cars. Apple’s current overall [gross margins](https://postimg.cc/ykv1mfVP) stand at 38% vs the 15% average of the world top 10 automakers by market cap, which is significantly lower.

But this Apple Car thing is so long out, and there are so many unknowns, I will not try to predict anything related to this until there is more clarity on the subject.

And last, before moving on to some predictions, here are some of the highlights that we heard from the latest investors conference meeting, as the CEO, Tim Cook [expressed](https://postimg.cc/TyhpLzgg) optimism ahead with the launch of many new products and services, especially the Home Pod Mini and the new 5G iPhones, as these new iPhones include new LIDAR scanners that greatly improve the camera capabilities, as the iPhone as seen very positive reviews. We also saw the Senior VP and CFO, Luca Maestri give us great [outlook](https://postimg.cc/DWDmqxPD) for the company as they expect the installed devices base to continue to growth despite already being at an all-time high as they have over 585M paid subscriptions on their platforms and expect this to surpass 600M by the end of 2020.

I also researched and found what products we can see in the near future, with the first half of [2021](https://postimg.cc/jCBQsXVM) bringing new iMacs, the AirPods3 and the iPad Pro, while in the [FALL](https://postimg.cc/8jVJKngg) event we will probably get the new iPhone 13 alongside the iPhone SE PLUS and the Watch Series 7 with more products coming [later](https://postimg.cc/GHc3s01t) in 2021 or that don’t have an estimated release date like the Air Pods Pro, the Air Tags and the iPad Mini 6.

So, before even starting, you should know that I am bull on Apple but I am willing to hear other opinions so don’t be afraid to leave a comment down below.

I have made some predictions based on the growth rate of the [company](https://postimg.cc/JHRDpPGQ), the latest plans announced by them and used some estimates. So, keep in mind this are only projections and are calculated by myself, this is not an investment advice and you should do your own research.

This are my 2025 projections for Apple, let’s take a closer look at them, each on their own.

So, in term of revenues, Apple has 5 big sources of revenue, which saw an overall increase of 6% despite lagging sales in the iPhone. The biggest revenue is by a big margin the iPhone right now with over $137B in revenue in the fiscal year ending in September. I expect to see the iPhone sales increasing in the next years, especially in 2021, with the new 5G iPhone creating a super-cycle for the [company](https://postimg.cc/XGfBKT7J), as most iPhone users, including myself here, as I will upgrade from my iPhone X, will switch to this new product. The iPhone sales have decreased in the last couple of years by 14% and 3% as a result of the product not having big improvements, as well as iPhone usually starting to last longer than previous models, so I expect to see a 12% increase in sales next year and a gradual decrease in the growth of sales as more people upgrade, ending with just a 5% growth in iPhone [sales](https://postimg.cc/V0wfRpr7) in 2025.

The next revenues stream is from the Mac, which has seen an increase in the past 2years, with revenues topping $28B this year after the huge demand from the work from home consumers. I [expect](https://postimg.cc/1405tm2b) this trend to continue as they plan to continue to launch better products and I can see the company having a similar growth next year before starting to decline slightly until 2025, also ending with a 5% growth.

The iPad is currently the smallest revenue stream for Apple but has also seen an increase in demand in the past 2 years with a 13% average increase in revenues. I also expect the iPad to continue to grow in the next couple of years, especially with the learn-from-home environment for kids, and even after this period ends, the transformation for learning will implicate more digital usage. I [expect](https://postimg.cc/5XKtVsT0) the iPad to see some similar growth to the Macs, especially with the latest generation also bringing a new iPad air to the market.

The 4th revenue stream and the fastest growing in the past 2 years, with an average growth of 33% are the wearables, home & accessories revenues. This have topped $30B this year, as Apple has also just launched the Apple Watch series 6 and also feature other great products like Apple TV, the Air Pods the Home Pod and the Home Pod mini alongside other third-party accessories.

I gave this [revenue](https://postimg.cc/v4C4JQ4T) stream a growth of 20% starting next year with a gradual decrease to around 8% by 2025, as I believe this will become more & more popular as they start to have more vertical integration.

And last, but by no means least, the revenue stream that I expect to grow the most and the fastest is the revenue from the services that Apple gets. This includes revenues from Apple Care, Advertising, Cloud Services, Payment Services like Apple Card & Apple Pay and of course the digital content which includes fees from the App Store alongside subscription-based revenue including the new Apple One Bundle and Apple Fitness+ alongside the already know Apple Arcade, Apple Music, Apple News+, Apple TV+ and hopefully I don’t forget any others.

So, I [expect](https://postimg.cc/svV7mDWR) this to become the clear 2nd biggest revenue stream for Apple by 2025, as I expect this to grow more than 20% next year, mainly due to the Apple One Bundle and Apple Fitness+ followed up by a slightly decreasing growth, ending with a 10% increase in revenues in 2025.

I think this are fairly conservative base case scenarios for the revenues, as I expect them to continue to increase the [other](https://postimg.cc/1VFFgkxJ) revenue streams and not have such a large percentage of the revenues coming from the iPhone sales as you can see in this chart.

In terms of expenses, I pretty much kept the same margins as in previous years, with a 68% expense ratio on product sales \[ [iPhone](https://postimg.cc/JDZ7jMnD) / [iPad](https://postimg.cc/Wd14CB9C) / [Mac](https://postimg.cc/q6GkZw2p) / [WHA](https://postimg.cc/211q9q8g) \] and 35% expense ratio on [SERVICES](https://postimg.cc/8sdLLrjH), as this are way more lucrative.

In the past 3 years, the products [gross margin](https://postimg.cc/ykv1mfVP) was 32.7%, so I actually imply bigger expenses for the manufacturing and sales of products, as this is mostly impacted by the company’s supplier’s ability to make up for and demand, while for the services revenue, the gross margins for the last 3 years has been 63.5% on average, but I expect this to be more in-line with the 66% margin in this past year. So, if services manage to grow to about half the revenues from the iPhone, this will double the gross revenues, as every buck gained in the service revenues account for 2$ in the product sales.

So, I expect the total [revenues](https://postimg.cc/sMjByQ2n) for Apple to increase from $274B in 2020 to over $440B by 2025, increasing by approximately 10%/year, while I will keep the expense ratio pretty much in-line and have them increasing by 11%/year, this would bring the total gross for Apple to $177B, increasing mainly due to the services revenues as I said earlier. This growth is just above the 4year [average](https://postimg.cc/Tp8g83mS), and below the 2018 levels, which we might see again with this 5G super-cycle and explosive growth in the services revenue.

I also think the company will continue to invest in both Capital Expenditure and Operating expenses.

I think the operating expenses will remain pretty much in line with the [previous](https://postimg.cc/2qBCfrnc) years, as this number has increased by 1% [annually](https://postimg.cc/Fd5JL9v8) both in R&D and SG&A. So, I will keep the exact percentages from previous years, as I expect the revenue to increase, thus I don’t see a big increase percentage wise. This would account for over $60B in operating expenses by 2025 and over $11B in Capital Expenditures by 2025, as I expect this to increase, mainly due to the possible EV developments or investments in self-driving capabilities alongside other manufacturing capabilities. You can see that the Capex [spending](https://postimg.cc/yDsRdpLy) has been decreasing in the past years with just over $8.8B in payments for business acquisitions and the other traditional Capex spending. Some people may use the cash generated by [investing](https://postimg.cc/Mn9nG6Mz) activities as Capex, but that is more unreliable. I also can see the Capex going back up, so I wanted to be safe and implied a 10% growth.

This money would account for over $73B in [expenses](https://postimg.cc/dZnY91K1) and would bring the profit for the company to almost $104B before **I&T**.

Moving on, let’s see what revenue and expenses the [company](https://postimg.cc/cgy0x2ms) has had in the past few years. We can see a decrease in **I** expense in the past few years as the company has been paying debt, but they have also been generating less money in this department, with an overall decrease in this department of more than 50% in the past year, way less than the amount from 2018. So, for safety reasons, I used a 10% decline in both revenues and expenses [related](https://postimg.cc/QKgtZhZG) to **I**, while increasing the other losses by 10%/year.

This would bring the company pre-tax $$$ to just over $104B in 2025.

Let’s move on to taxes. I know the Federal tax rate is 21% for the [company](https://postimg.cc/ykY39pq1), but the actual tax rate for the company was lower than 15% in the past year, mainly due to lower tax-rates on foreign earnings alongside tax-benefits and tax-settlements. The average tax rate has been just over 16% in the past 3 years, but with more and more of the revenues coming from outside the US, I think it’s safe to say that the company will have around a 15% tax rate by 2025, this obviously if nothing major changes in tax policy around the world.

So, Apple would [have](https://postimg.cc/Wqc3ytKw) $88.6B in $$ after tax by 2025 and with the current outstanding shares standing at just under 17B, so I don’t even account for the company probably continuing to do share buybacks, this would mean a $5.22 [future](https://postimg.cc/4YytCLwL) earnings/share. And with today’s price for Apple just around 136$, that would mean to [company](https://postimg.cc/RNf1qH44) is trading at just over 26 times forward price to earnings.

I don’t think Apple will ever trade at a discount again, with the current PE [standing](https://postimg.cc/RqwqHQ6s) at over 40, I believe this will eventually go down, probably to around 35, despite the increase in services revenue, which is highly valued by investors. I think we can see Apple trade somewhere near 35 [times](https://postimg.cc/5H98PKv2) P/E in 2025, especially if something big happens with the EV project, this could be even higher, just look at Tesla which trades at [insane](https://postimg.cc/sBZhxMk5) P/E. Of course, we also have to take into consideration the dividends that will be received from owning the stock, as Apple has started to pay dividends almost a decade ago and has 9 years of dividend growth, with a 10% annual rate of [growth](https://postimg.cc/CnbZMbD2) in the past 5 years. [Here](https://postimg.cc/7CLT1G8C) is the dividend growth history for the company, as I also went conservative on this [estimate](https://postimg.cc/Tp7LcjGr) and implied a 7% growth for the next 2 years, 6% for 2023 and 2024 and just 5% in 2025.

So [here](https://postimg.cc/R3PK21QQ) are my 3 price targets for the company, [including](https://postimg.cc/JHR8JXvv) dividends but not reinvested. My bear case scenario is that Apple will trade at almost 165$ which implies a [return](https://postimg.cc/jCYzWhd2) of over 21% by 2025, while my base case scenario would see Apple trading at 195$ with a return of capital of 43%. I will also make the bull case for Apple trading at 225$ by 2025 with dividends included, which would imply just over 65% in gains by then.

I think this is possible as Apple has also [continued](https://postimg.cc/fJj36jMt) to buy back shares of the company on a constant basis, as they continue to an impressive campaign with over $72B worth of common stock repurchased in 2020. They continue to buy back shares at a very fast pace, having repurchased over 1.3B shares in 2019 and 2018, while also issuing less stock every year.

So here is the full [spreadsheet](https://postimg.cc/Z995KrzL) that I have projected for Apple by 2025 and the breakdown of everything i estimated \[ [1](https://postimg.cc/jCT7qdZJ) / [2](https://postimg.cc/DmcbSkMp) \] , if you do have another opinion or a suggestion please leave a comment down below, I think I have been conservative in most of my projections, but feel free to give your opinion.

Keep in mind, these targets might sound ridiculous, but just [look](https://postimg.cc/V50nHCSn) at the growth Apple has had in the last 5years. The company has increased in value by more 400% in just the past 5years and is over 100.000% up since it started trading. So yes, the valuation is mad right now for the company. So, are you willing to bet against Apple?

The company also has pristine [financials](https://postimg.cc/LYcYMxqf), with more than $65B in total assets compared to total liabilities, and more than $38B in cash and cash equivalents.

So, what do I expect in the next couple of days, weeks and months for Apple?

Let’s look at this [CHART](https://postimg.cc/7592T1c8), so starting with the stock split, Apple saw a correction within the September stock market pullback, in a buy the news & sell the event, after a huge runup post-announcement of the stock split. The stock entered a consolidation period, and didn’t have any big catalysts, especially with new iPhone lineup not being included in the Q4 results due to the late launch. The stock found some levels of resistance near the $120 levels that it struggled to get past but acted also as support after breaking them just before the recent news of the possible EV developments or self-driving-features to be licensed to other car manufacturers. After that news the stock spiked and has now reached the previous highs made before the stock split and is facing some resistance, if the stock pushes over $140 I think we can say that it broke the resistance at those levels and is not just a fake-out. But I think it’s likely that the stock will consolidate between 122 and 135$ in the next weeks until the next iPhone sales and quarterly results are released, as the stock has entered overbought territory again with an RSI over 70, the first time since the stock split.

So, what would I do? Well, I own Apple stock, and I would really add on any weakness that the stock shows before the next quarter earnings are released, as typically Q1 [earnings](https://postimg.cc/V5t0FPTF) are the best for the company due to increased holiday sales combined with the launch of new products. I think any entry below 130$ would be really nice to start and build a position or increase it if you already own the stock.

Monday's market open saw an immediate meltdown and began this 🌈🐻  channel and Tuesday saw us drip below our $25 [support zone](https://www.tradingview.com/ideas/supportandresistance/). After the Dec 7th run-up  🌈 🐻tried pulling us below $25 on the 10th and 16th, but we held the line. The 9 day MA trading below the 20 day MA suggests to me that this 🌈🐻trend will continue in the short term. [PLTR ](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NYSE-PLTR/)is currently bouncing off the lower BB and against the upper crayon line I drew, the next pop is going to be volatile AF. If at market open we don't hold the fuck'n line, I believe that we'll probably gap down to the $20-$22 range.  


Personally, I think the trend is pointing that we'll finish the year below $25. This doesn't really bother me much, in the near term we have 2 catalyst dates in January and hype leading up to their [earnings](https://www.tradingview.com/ideas/fundamental/) call on the 11th of Feb.

Today it closed around $32.36 BUT after hours right now are currently trading around $34-$34.80.

Tesla was testing new sensors and was rumored to have LUMINAR sensors on them.

" The implication, if it isn't clear, is that Tesla might be testing Luminar's sensors. If true, that would be [big news](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/12/29/why-luminar-technologies-stock-jumped-today/) for a couple of reasons."

Then it goes to quality control of this lidar company.

"[Luminar](https://www.trefis.com/stock/lazr/articles/505626/is-velodyne-or-luminar-stock-the-better-bet-on-the-self-driving-market/2020-12-29), on the other hand, is focused on building sensors that can be used in mass-market vehicles. The company’s sensors are expected to hit the sweet spot for automakers, costing under $1,000 per unit while offering very strong performance relative to their price."

While we have bearish Velodyne producing high cost yet high quality sensors.

"Based on cumulative shipments and revenue data from the company’s form S-1, its sensors cost an average of $14k per unit."

Who the fuck wants to pay an extra 13k for their sensors? Lamborghini wouldn't even want to invest into these high costly ass sensors. Tesla would then look for other technology WHICH IS LUMINAR because of a $13,000 difference.

These new electric vehicles that are coming to the market to compete with Tesla will look for a high marginal benefit of sensors which would be Luminar for the price alone.

EDIT: I don't see how Velodyne could get markets to purchase their sensors for reasons of cost alone. People are hyping up Velodyne for what? Their business model? Let's look numbers and how their product cost a whopping $13,000 more than their competitor.

This is the first in a series of posts on my bull thesis for BP. I'll break down my analysis into short-term and long-term expectations. In my first post, I'll cover industry trends and explain why there is still a bull case for legacy energy firms like BP. I will follow up over the next few weeks detailing my short-term and long-term thesis for BP.

# Introduction

**The global energy market has increased more than 7 fold since the 1950s**, and is expected to **grow by up to 2x over the next 3 decades**. The majority of said growth is expected to come from **emerging markets** including Brazil, India, China, and Africa. However, despite the growth in energy demand, **oil and gas firms have been lagging behind in returns** vis-a-vis the rest of the NASDAQ. Brent crude has fared even worse.

**Regulatory push** coupled with an **increase in the social consciousness of climate change** are the primary reasons for slow growth in oil and CNG. This is especially true in developed countries. Global demand for clean energy is expected to grow by up to 8% CAGR over the next decade. In addition, renewables can be as cheap as if not more affordable than crude or gas.

https://preview.redd.it/7as924qor9861.png?width=2096&format=png&auto=webp&s=b9efb086bf0f7b12367f3214b8adf9f6130f7856

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, **prices for crude has fallen by more then 50% since November 2019** (when the Lazard research was published). At one point in time, oil futures were negative - large amounts of unconsumed of brent crude and CNG cost producers money to store, and oil tankers piled up on coasts and in the open seas.

# The future of energy

So is the future of 100% energy renewables? Not quite. **Energy storage continues to be a massive PITA for most municipalities**. Lithium ion cells are extraordinarily expensive and bulky. Unconventional storage techniques (e.g. using bricks, dams, etc) are also pricey. **While there has been a breakthrough in energy production, there hasn't been a breakthrough in energy storage**. Despite the numerous claims recently by firms such as Nanotech in graphene batteries and the like, there remains one major problem - scalability. In fact, this is a problem that has plagued energy scientists and battery engineers over the past 2 decades - anyone can produce graphene cells, but nobody can figure out how to do so at scale. **Energy is consumed consistently, but clean energy cannot be produced constantly.**

[Energy consumption \(day vs night\)](https://preview.redd.it/b4s3bpn2u9861.png?width=599&format=png&auto=webp&s=1b27992309519f4ab395c74f0c8ba143c1d23dc6)

&#x200B;

[Wind speeds variability in month of December](https://preview.redd.it/n6jelzseu9861.png?width=500&format=png&auto=webp&s=173d8fd02111bf27468bdfbc425ebd53ae9bd4dc)

Of course, solar energy can only be produced in the day, and not at night. This means that during lull periods of energy production (e.g. at night when wind speeds don't support energy production), energy solutions that are not dependent on environmental factors (hydrocarbons - HCRs) need to kick in (unless energy storage is available). But **the cost of energy storage + renewable energy production is still far greater (1.5 to 3x depending on region) than the cost of traditional hydrocarbons**.

In addition, the inability to store renewable energy affordably and compactly means that it is **not a viable form of energy for high-duration industrial and transportation activities - e.g. shipping, air travel etc**. Therefore, it would be illogical to assume that traditional hydrocarbons would not have a role to play over the next few decades.

Today, the **cost of energy = cost of production + cost of regulations or taxes**. If the cost of climate change were to be internalized in the cost of CNG or crude oil production, the cost of legacy energies is bound to be higher than that of alternatives.

However, regulations are not imposed nor are they enforced globally. This means that **countries without a climate change mandate will be inclined to go for the cheapest possible energy source** to fulfill their energy needs. Read: most developing nations. Given that the **cost of energy = cost of production for countries without strong climate change regulations**, there continue to be demand for legacy energies in developing nations. That's BRICS (ex China) = 2.5Bn+ people by 2030.

Therefore, demand for polluting energies such as CNG and oil will continue to increase (albeit marginally) over the decade despite a spike in interest and demand for clean energy. **Developing nations would simply displace developed nations in the consumption of legacy energies**.

**We have not reached peak oil demand; we're just at the bottom of a cycle.** Contrary to popular belief, **demand for oil/gas will not collapse**. In fact, global demand for liquid fuels is expected to **increase by up to 6.3% in 2021**.

# Part 1 Conclusion

Here, I've laid out my case for **liquid fuels and legacy oil companies should be a key part of your COVID-19 reopening trade** (which is pretty duh). I'll expand on this in my next post, and explain why BP is a better buy compared to its peers, both in the short term (<1Y) and the long term._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Need a Miracle I know isn't coming - SLV Gang _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ A message from Cohen after today's red day. _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Thanks everyone

I would be borrowing $8,000 to cover 100 shares. The RH gold interest rate is 2.5%. That's $200 annually or $16.66 a month on $8,000 of borrowed capital.

Say I bought 100 shares at it's current price of $76.36. I could then sell the $80 call exp. 1/29/2021 for $4.30. This would cover my monthly interest and bring my break even price down to $72.22.

I understand that there's the risk the stock could drop $20 or possibly even more. However, that's just one month. If each month I sold a covered call I can lower my break even price by roughly $4.30 or even more if I go closer to ITM. By February my break even could be around $67.92, so on and so forth. On the other hand if it doesn't drop lower or I even get assigned than it's a max profit of $794 which is all pretty much profit off money that wasn't even mine. 

I am also bullish on NET and it's $10 below it's ATH so it seems like a good idea that I want to act on. I'm just looking for someone to try and talk me out of it.

# TL;DR 85C 1/15/2021

**300C 2023**

Good evening WSB. I've concluded developing my portfolio for the year and have some time to discuss Pinterest as a strong growth investment. After a lot of debate and research, Pinterest is my favorite investment possibly ever. In a way, Pinterest sort of feels as if Amazon had been reborn and built by women's economic interests. It's totally phenomenal and I think this company will reach a 200B valuation sooner rather than later.

# - Pinterest is 400m+ MONTHLY active users, where 70-80% of them are women. That is incredible userbase to have where incentives can quickly follow. THAT'S HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF WOMEN FFS

**- These users are seek high quality content and use the application with the intention to discover new idea to try.** **That is a transnational product space to own.** For example, searching for "Rihanna Fenty lipstick" will soon have you seated in front of a digital camera with product filters. They are only a few months away from applying the same technology to haircuts and other sorts of shopping digital shopping assets. **My god damn mother is 52 and uses pinterest for SEWING IDEAS IN MEXICO MY DUDES.**

&#x200B;

\- It has an incredibly high-quality **search engine for** **ideas**. This search trait is a common search asset of Google because Google's SEO architecture. It's a complex web of decisions that Pinterest fulfills commonly sought content from Google users. A common search trait  "food near me" type searches. Another is "Thanksgiving stuffing".

&#x200B;

\- Google searches for companys that often deliver high quality images, fast delivery of content, and other important internet quality demands. Google's SEO explains why including "Reddit" in a question will provide excellent answers. In the same vein, I believe Google is pushing web standards aggressively through its Chrome dominance and **Fastly** will benefit from such a shift.

Iron ore outperformed all commodities in 2020, more than doubling to record highs on strong Chinese steel demand.

Prices may not gain as much next year, but supply worries in Brazil coupled with enduring strength in Chinese manufacturing and construction suggest the market still has legs.

“Strong end-user steel demand and robust Chinese property indicators suggest the rally in iron ore may not be over,” said OCBC Bank economist Howie Lee.

Lee expects prices to peak in the second quarter of 2021 on demand from China’s infrastructure projects. “But normalizing supply from Brazil and moderating demand from China could pressure iron ore by end-2021.”

This aligns with what I have been saying on steel and steel stocks. 

If prices peak and companies lock in orders for the second half of 2021, which they will look to do, any reduction in iron ore costs will enhance margins as they will have contract orders in hand with lower input costs.

Cathy was on Bloomberg pumping genetic stocks and talking up her book a few weeks ago. Simpleton investors started pouring money in her fund ARKG so much that created a short-squeeze in some of the underlying assets:

Looking at Crispr: it has a market cap of 11 B. ARKK owns 1B and ARKG owns 0.5B of it. That's about 14% of the company. Now that wouldn't be an issue but here is the problem. ARK is building it's position in those companies too quickly. Buying a significant portion of the float while pumping the stocks leads to other investor buying in too. This creates a feedback loop of price going up. People seeing that value of ARKG and CRSP is going up and putting more money in and then ARKG is forced to buy at a more inflated price and this positive feedback loop created an unsustainable pump.

u/ahminus confirmed to me that, after each short position, there must inevitably be a new long position, because somebody bought the shorted share. And that makes sense, after all. If we simplify things by saying that 100% of outstanding shares have been shorted, that means we have roughly 200% long positions for GME, compared to outstanding shares. Add that to the list of ridiculous things about this stock...

If I'm interpreting this in a retarded, incorrect way, teach me the right way, because we're here to know... the way.

Anyway, if only 122% of those 200% long positions are held by institutions, that's basically 61%. Compared to Best Buy for example [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BBY/holders?p=BBY](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BBY/holders?p=BBY)  
or Target [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TGT/holders?p=TGT](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TGT/holders?p=TGT) we're still a long ways off.

Obviously, we could include Cohen's 13% into this calculation, even though he's technically an Insider. That does brings us a bit closer to the 2 examples above.

Either way, this begs the question. ***Ignoring all the other factors for the moment (I know, hard to ignore that 100% short interest...) how much more juice do we have left in this engine if this stock achieves, umm... respectable, 'established' percentage of institutional ownership?!***

Because, we all know, deep in our hearts, that despite all our efforts and meme energy, we don't have enough buying power to keep pumping the stock price up for the next 3-9 months. It is these multi-hundred-billion $$$ tutes that move the needle, as always.

POSITION: europoor 231 shares @ $15.41. Salary coming soon, dumping all of it in shares, at whatever price...

Being an autistic I did some digging on [threshold securities.](https://www.investor.gov/introduction-investing/investing-basics/glossary/threshold-securities) **Any stock being naked shorted will show up on the list and will persist until those shares are covered.** The day this first appeared on the list?

Well who cares right? Being a stuck in the basement while my wife and her boyfriend rehearse the scene in the casting couch, I looked if this happened in the past. It did, on September 22, 2020 till [October 8, 2020](https://imgur.com/IkiT9xi). October 8th did get some [Microsoft news](https://www.windowscentral.com/gamestop-strikes-multiyear-deal-microsoft-cloud-surface-and-xbox-all-access) which caused the spike but with it naked shorts probably did close out their positions. But what about this time? Well on [Dec 22th we saw a huge 25%](https://imgur.com/T1DykxH) run up, this means they covered out their naked shorting right? [Nope](https://www.nyse.com/regulation/threshold-securities) they didn't. It's still on the list. Even if it wasn't on the threshold securities list, I'd say the short interest had to [of stayed flat or gone higher.](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/short-interest/) Which also means that big 25% run up on December 22th wasn't a short covering but huge buyers coming in and not Ryan Cohen.

So what am I getting to now? From what I've dug up, at some point when they are forced to close out their naked shorts (not talking about their regular 68M short position) and is no longer on the threshold security list, **GME can still easily gap up +30% in a day.**

For everyone saying it'll never squeeze as GME has been shorted for years. You are correct its been manipulated for years but unlike then we got [Ryan motherfucken Cohen](https://whalewisdomalpha.com/rc-ventures-increased-gamestop-stake/) covering our backs.

Pocket shy of 15k. 😎😅🥴 _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Rally Cries for GME Gang!!!   

Well GME gang… here we are. Yesterday, the gay bears fired a warning shot across our bow, and we ignored it. Our cash-colored glasses blinded us from seeing the true intent behind their perceived tomfoolery. We dropped our guard and became too comfortable with our gains and the positions we held with our hands of diamond. Our neglect to respond to that act gave them all the confidence they needed to launch a full out assault on GME Gang.

The result has been a true massacre. At exactly 0930 hours, Melvin Capital and their gay friends invaded our investment accounts and choked us with their girthy red bear dicks. We were unprepared for the attack, and, as a result, our army suffered mass casualties. We lost many of our brethren today. Men who had the best of intentions but the paper-iest of hands. Their tendies… lost to the ever-churning war machine.

The intent of the bears was not only to crush our spirits, but to offset some of their losses in order to regain the confidence of their boomer investors on their end-of-year report. This would, in turn, give them more ammunition to continue fighting this war. 

But I have 5 words for those rainbow-dicked prostate smoochers over at Melvin:

The. Year. Isn’t. Over. Yet.

Yeah. That’s right. Tomorrow is December 30th. December FUCKING 30th. Twenty MOTHERFUCKING TWENTY.

It’s time to remind them that we own >5% of this fucking company, and we make the fucking rules.

Tonight we ride across the digital countryside like PAUL FUCKING REVERE and spread the gospel of u/DeepFuckingValue LIKE IT’S FUCKING COVID. Let every autist with a Robinhood account and boomer with a 401k alike know that THE SQUEEZE IS UPON US AND WE MUST BUY SHARES TO FULFILL THE DESTINY OF DADDY COHEN.

Let tomorrow be a day of reckoning for bears across the globe. Show them that the strength of our collective retardation knows no bounds.

Today, we are retards. Today, we are low-functioning autists. Today, we eat tendie scraps in the basement.

Tomorrow, we are the market makers. Tomorrow, we are our wife’s boyfriends. Tomorrow, we dine in VALHALLA.

RETARDS.

EDIT: 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ A message from God himself _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ PFE & MRNA 🚀 🌑 _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Buying right before earnings - fully autistic or free money? Ok, hear me out.

What does every boomer trader say when they tell you about a stock?  Never hold through earnings.

They always advise playing the runs before and after the earnings report but tell any cuck who will listen that holding through earnings is "gambling".

Well well well, gambling eh?  Now you've piqued my interest.  But here's the thing, every trader over the age of 30 sees an ER coming and they shit their pants and sell right before the release.  They lack the diamond hands and steel balls to play the game how it's meant to be played and risk getting caught bag holding.  But when you combine these paper handed traders all exiting their positions at the same time you'll see a massive downward pressure on a stock an hour or two before earnings.

That's where we come in.  This short opportunity to buy the dip means that if earnings disappoint it's a smaller loss, but if earnings boom the share price moons 🚀.

Now you may be wondering if I have any data to back up my claims.  The answer is no.  But I do have some anecdotal evidence.  Basically, a few weeks ago I bought a couple Nike FD's before earnings after seeing some positive momentum in the stock.  Then suddenly, on the day of the release, the underlying shares completely reverse, nearly wiping out all the gains from the last week.  I'm shitting my pants thinking everyone knows something I don't until ER come out positive, and on the next Monday shares hit all time highs.

Now my calls had already expired worthless at that point, but the idea still makes sense.  I'd say this strategy will work better just purchasing shares, because even when prices sell off, if it's before earnings then IV crush will still be a bitch.

So what's the play?  On January 7th, $BBBY reports earnings.  I'm bullish on Bed Bath & Beyond anyways as a reopening play, so this is the perfect opportunity to load up on shares.  I'm guessing the dip will occur just a few hours before market close (assuming earnings come out during the aftermarket), although they could happen as early as market open on the release day.  Either way, as soon as I see a dip, I'm putting on my Baskin Robbins uniform and scooping up shares like they're Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough.

Thx for reading and I'll see y'all in tendie town 🚀🚀

Edit: Also works for FDA approvals

MM's don't want to pay out the $21 calls for Dec 31. Next week it would make sense for them to de-risk those shorts and allow the stock to move up to 22 for the Jan 15 expiry since there's 11k open interest for 1/15 22 strike calls. IF they are successful in keeping the stock below $22 until January 15 it will take a lot more shorting, and an even greater squeeze potential. This could be a GME type situation by February.

If you want a little DD, they tripled their quarterly revenue year over year in their last earnings report, you can do the rest of your DD yourself

Some **position options**: **buy shares** 🚀🚀

**buy** Jan $22 **calls** with a break even of 22.60 (theta .03) 🚀🚀

Buy **covered calls** if you think they will be successful in holding the stock below $22 = **$20.15 average** shares cost (buy lots of 100 shares and sell Jan 15 22 calls) 🌈🚀

There are some other similar products like it, but butterfly's ultrasound device is the cheapest and also one of the highest rated (just search it up on youtube and you'll see tons of videos from doctors saying how great it is).

At current valuations at $20 per share for LGVW butterfly network is valued at about $3B. Three points for my bull case:

1) The founders and owners envision a future where every man and woman in the world can have this ultrasound device just like a smartphone. If someone thinks there is something wrong with them, they can just do a little scan, send the results to a doctor and the doctor can just message the results back

2) The usual ultrasound devices are very expensive and cost tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of dollars, are clunky, hard to move and are not instant. Many undeveloped countries don't have the luxury to afford such devices, so there's a lot of opportunity for expansion here

3) Subscription service for cloud storage, ML, and on site training services


I first became interested in this company when I saw that ARK was buying the spac week after week and that bill gate's foundation is an early investor. This isn't one of those EV companies with no product or vaporware, they actually manufacture something that can revolutionize the healthcare industry. 

The merger is expected to complete by the first quarter of 2021, and I don't think the upside for this company has been fully realized yet.

I know that this is not impacting only GME, but it's still a wonderful news for us 💎👐

See you in tendies town 🚀🚀🚀_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ GME Gang, don't let Robinhood lend your shares to the shorts and Melvin! DD inside for more tendies For y'all holding GME in your Robinhood margin accounts, **don't!** Robinhood [earns a lot of its money](https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/how-robinhood-makes-money/) from lending securities from margin accounts to shorts, and unlike other brokers, doesn't share this income with you! And if you're unsure if you have a margin account or not, [by default](https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/robinhood-accounts/), you have a margin account. Keep options and whatever other not crazily shorted shit in your RH account, but for stuff like GME, why make it easy for Melvin?

So what can you do to screw over those greedy shorts who have manipulated GME for far too long? Either switch your Robinhood account to a cash account (but then no more instant deposits), or if you still want those instant deposits, move over your GME holdings to another broker like Fidelity or Schwab with a non-margin account.

Best of all, if you buy from some toilet paper hands on Robinhood that get scared off on days like today, then you're helping fortify the front line! Imagine if WSB can take another 1-2% of the float away from shorts!

Less supply -> more fees for shorts -> more covering -> 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Let's show Wall Street just how creative and unrelenting us WSB degenerates can be!! DIAMOND HANDS TO TENDIE TOWN  **💎🙌 💎**
