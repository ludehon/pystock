 Bet on Tendies to get Tendies Listen up you bunch of degenerates, I have a fool-proof way for all of us to get rich. With things shutting down and less people having large Thanksgiving celebration, less people are having large turkeys on Thursday. Most of you idiots will be at home, alone, eating your premade tendies jerking it to the sad excuse for a MACY's day parade. Demand for tendies will rise, and tendie producers like Tyson will moon. Always bet on the tendies.

Hope you made some money on my CRSR DD. I'm now looking at OSTK goin into Black Friday. If you've been on it this year you've probably had some 5-10x baggers. Summer was crazy. Huge drop from ATH but it's signaling a run for the next 2 weeks and has bullish technicals and catalysts.

Overstock.com, INC. $OSTK NASDAQ currently at $62.25 per share going into 11/23/2020.

Overstock.com, Inc. is an American internet retailer headquartered in Midvale, Utah, near Salt Lake City. Patrick M. Byrne founded Overstock.com in 1999.

Market Cap: 2.64b

2nd Quarter Bullish Points:

Total net revenue was $783 million, an increase of 109% year over year
Gross profit was $180 million or 23.0% of total net revenue, an improvement of 321 basis points year over year

OSTK AMZN BABA W and other online retailers were oversold over the last month. Election volatility fucked everybody up, then Vaccine news rotated the market and clearly the consumer services sector was hit hard. This is a buying opportunity for OSTK. I'm not saying the market can't drop and take these down further with it, we're due for that - but the support is clear on every ticker I just mentioned and the channel I'm seeing OSTK break out of is worth posting about especially going into Black Friday.

They're going to blow away next earnings after Holiday Season with online sales but OSTK doesn't just sell couches, and earnings isn’t til March.  The real potential for growth comes with their efforts in FinTech.

EDIT: I would go more into this catalyst but wsb rules don't allow it. Basically Overstock is that dude that has a steady job but also has a side hustle that can make him even more money. The SEC allows OSTK to manage and trade shitcoins. Overstock was one of the first major retailers in 2014 to accept shitcoin as a payment. Go look at the price of shitcoin in 2014. OSTK has been selling futons and lamps in exchange for shitcoin for 6 years. Checkmate. tZERO is owned by Overstock and their software ATS tokenizes assets for businesses. This is in high demand right now as you’ll read in the coming weeks. They have inked new deals with Wall St. firms recently and are on the verge of some very bullish deals. We're in the middle of a shitcoin bullrun. Look it up. This is the real catalyst.

Regardless, the technicals are what drew me to this play:

OSTK is down 50% from their ATH's. Anyone who traded it this year knows how ridiculous the gains can be. When this moves, this moves fast. 716.93% yearly increase is nothing to joke about. The fact that it didn't drop below 50 in November is hella bullish to me. Made its way back above 60 on Friday. 63 is where the fun begins.

https://i.imgur.com/iQylnIn.png

Trading in an extremely tight range for a bullish breakout. If OSTK opens above 62.95 on 11/23 it should test 77.5 by 11/27. If it breaks above that earlier, next price target is 85.10. Beyond that, ATH's. Breaking 61.25 to 56.17 bearish down to 52.79 potentially, but I don't think that will happen.

I see 70 coming easily if volume picks up early in the week.

Historically, Thanksgiving week is green and looking at futures right now I'm expecting more of the same. I closed my CRSR positions, went into last Friday with SPY puts and sold end of day for a nice gain. Although I do see some potential downside for SPY, this market is fucking retarded so SPY 360 is just as possible. Nasdaq doesn't really seem to give a shit either way. I'm generally bearish but honestly I should've just put the money I made on CRSR into OSTK because this shit can fly all week. The market cap is so low for a company like this so high volume sends it as you can see from their performance all 2020. OSTK is worth 2.6b after selling off nearly 50% from ATH's but I wouldn't be surprised if it opened up big Monday after breaking out of the downward trend last week. Lots of eyes on it. The room for it to run up is insane considering catalysts like Black Friday, Holidays, lockdowns, shitcoin mooning and growing potential in FinTech space. I'm long OSTK.

**Ok. Cool. What the hell does SDGR do?**

In short, they leverage physics based simulations to speed up the drug discovery process. Check out [their website](https://www.schrodinger.com/platform). They have over 150 Ph.D. scientists on their team and have a [ton of publications](https://www.schrodinger.com/publications). 63 pages, 8 publications per page; they've got over 500 peer-reviewed papers. This is what I imagine Google looked like early on. Just look at how the employees [view the company on Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Schr%C3%B6dinger-Reviews-E428690.htm). This company is driven by Ph.D. scientists and researchers, instead of copy-pasta monkeys that are actually day trading during meetings.

This [old WSB post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gn0rp9/schrodinger_sdgr_computational_drug_discovery/) by u/Thereian has a nice write-up about SDGR. I'm gonna borrow the slide from an investor presentation they used that visualizes the value add of SDGR's platform.

https://preview.redd.it/ncda974gi2161.png?width=1938&format=png&auto=webp&s=f2c04456988209f366913a41b138ac472b646767

Schrödinger only recently IPO-ed. so let's look at [their S-1](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1490978/000119312520005504/d766269ds1.htm). Their software platform is currently being used by all of the top 20 pharmaceutical companies, and the company is seeing increasing usage, as reported in their [most recent Q2 earnings call transcript](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/08/10/schrodinger-inc-sdgr-q2-2020-earnings-call-transcr.aspx). The most important part of the S-1, however, is this:

>We also leverage our platform and capabilities across a portfolio of collaborative and wholly-owned drug discovery programs spanning a wide range of disease targets and indications. We are currently collaborating on more than 25 drug discovery programs with more than ten different biopharmaceutical companies, including a number of companies we co-founded. These collaborations generate drug discovery revenue, including research funding payments, and discovery and development milestones, and have the potential to produce additional milestone payments, option fees, and future royalties. Furthermore, since mid-2018, we have launched five internal, wholly-owned programs. We are leveraging our computational platform with the goal of rapidly advancing the discovery of best-in-class and first-in-class therapies. Our current programs are focused on discovering and developing inhibitors for targets in DNA damage response pathways and genetically defined cancers.

My god, that gets me hard. SDGR's software revenue will soon be insignificant compared to the royalties and payments it collects from its partnerships. Let's dig deeper into this.

Now add in the potential $2.7B from the partnership with BMY that was announced today: [https://www.marketwatch.com/story/schrodinger-in-drug-development-agreement-with-bristol-myers-worth-up-to-27-billion-in-milestone-and-royalty-payments-2020-11-23](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/schrodinger-in-drug-development-agreement-with-bristol-myers-worth-up-to-27-billion-in-milestone-and-royalty-payments-2020-11-23)

**Nimbus Therapeutics Already Sets a Precedent**

Nimbus Therapeutics was co-founded by Schrodinger, and similarly leverages computational chemistry to speed up the drug discovery process. Check out their website: [https://www.nimbustx.com/approach/](https://www.nimbustx.com/approach/)

If you want any more affirmation about the value of this technology, Nimbus sold their lead drug candidate for the treatment of NASH (basically, a disease that results from fat build-up in the liver) to Gilead Sciences for $1.2B. Read [this article](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20160404005324/en/Gilead-Sciences-Announces-Acquisition-Nimbus-Therapeutics%E2%80%99-Acetyl-CoA) for more information on that. In it, they mention that Nimbus used Schrödinger's platform to develop the drug candidate. And yes, SDGR received royalties for that deal.

&#x200B;

**SDGR is legitimately the puppet master pulling the strings for all of these companies. After all, many of them were founded by Schrödinger. Just look at this slide from their investor deck.**

Yes, they have their own internal drug discovery pipeline. Check this out:

**Now, the Icing on Top**

Why the fuck would I ever sell my EV meme stocks to buy this biotech company?

Read [this transcript of SDGR's Q2 earnings call](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/08/10/schrodinger-inc-sdgr-q2-2020-earnings-call-transcr.aspx)

>"As part of our ongoing efforts to deepen our software solutions for materials science applications, we entered into a three-year agreement in June with Gates Ventures to develop and apply novel, accurate atomistic simulation methods to improve battery performance."

Papa Musk recently noted at Tesla's Battery Day that improvements to battery tech will most likely come from advancements in materials science. Read all of that [here](https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/22/tesla-claims-it-can-drive-battery-costs-down-even-lower-with-new-material-science-innovations/). SDGR's already seen success applying its platform to drug discovery; who says they can't see similar success applying those methods to materials science? YOLO.

What do you guys think?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Legend of the WSB PS5 - I promise to pay PLTR forward. Gather round my fellow gamblers and shit posters, I have a story and a proposition for you all.

# The story:

Several weeks ago **I had the bright idea to YOLO my entire account into Palantir** on IPO day.

When PLTR was down and out, myself and a few other wise guys were balls to the wall in long positions. We all loved the company, but quite frankly, things were looking pretty bleak. While we knew the company should be worth more than the measly $9 it was at, the market price told us otherwise.

I was rather worried about what I had done. The blood red streaks in my account drove me to post **a sad story about how I had fucked up thousands and thousands of dollars of gains** (which I later deleted out of embarrassment). You can find the remnants of that story here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/j3xaua/once\_upon\_a\_time\_in\_2020/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/j3xaua/once_upon_a_time_in_2020/)

The only thing that remains is some top comments of people calling me a retarded degenerate.

I held on to my sweet sweet palantir, and as any good redditor would, I continued preaching the gospel of Thiel and Karp in any case.

in one WSB conversation, I was lamenting about how I needed money from Palantir in order to pay for the PS5 I had already pre-ordered. This was a very serious concern, because I had paid Walmart, and subsequently saw my Palantir position lose several thousand dollars... I wasn't quite sure how I would explain this one to the Mrs.

A classic millennial problem indeed.

Then along came a random internet stranger named u/ZanderPerk. He assured me I could enjoy tendies, and the Demon's Souls PS5 edition in 4k @ 60FPS all at the same time. He promised me that he **would buy me a PS5 if PLTR hit $20 by end of the year**, which at the time, seemed like an outlandish price. You can find that comment here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jj8apo/last\_chance\_for\_early\_bird\_pricing\_pltr/gagx94u/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jj8apo/last_chance_for_early_bird_pricing_pltr/gagx94u/?context=3)

A few weeks later, our sweet sweet hivemind started heating up, and I reminded the internet of what was promised: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jpbtx9/pltr\_looking\_forward\_to\_my\_free\_ps5/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jpbtx9/pltr_looking_forward_to_my_free_ps5/)

Zanderperk, being the gentleman that he is, assured me that **he would live up to his end of the bargain**: [https://i.imgur.com/8lM0j4D.png](https://i.imgur.com/8lM0j4D.png)

So in anticipation of this glorious transaction, I did what anyone in my position would, and ordered a custom bumper sticker in Zander's honour: [https://i.imgur.com/4d2yhA2.png](https://i.imgur.com/4d2yhA2.png)

This baby will be slapped right on top the console, and forever live beside my 55 inch 4k TV.

Now it seems that reddit has caught wind of this tale, and people are calling on Zander to send me the money. I have asked him for his email address so that I can send him a PayPal money request, to the tune of $399 USD. You can see further discussion here:

# The Proposition:

Finally, here is my promise to pay it forward.

Since PLTR has indeed hit $20 before the end of the year, **I will do the exact same thing for someone else IF Zander pays up AND it hits $30 before the end of the year.**

If Zander sends me the money, I will post pictures of the PS5 and sticker in WSB for you all to see, and I will update this post with a link to that post. (The sticker doesn't arrive until \~Dec 7th.)

***Then*** if PLTR crosses $30.00 before the end of Dec 31 2020, I will set up a quick lottery system to give out another PS5 using some clever technology that will be determined at a later date. (I already have an idea in mind.)

In order to enter the draw, people must be able to prove that they are still in an active PLTR stock holding or long PLTR option position. The position must be started or purchased before the end of the day tomorrow (November 24th) and they must still hold the position at the end of the day PLTR reaches $30. **Bears can fuck off.**

The winner will be ordered a PS5 digital edition off of Amazon, Walmart or Bestbuy straight to an address of their choice. The winner must reside in a country that receives deliveries from one of these stores.

As a final condition, the recipient of the PS5 from me will be strongly encouraged/expected to do the same for someone else at $40.

*CHECK BACK HERE FOR UPDATES.*

UPDATE: u/zanderperk just sent me $400!!! It’s on! I’ll be buying a digital edition for someone at $30.

UPDATE: I will post a form or survey for you to enter the draw. Stop messaging me asking to enter haha._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Next 10 bagger.. Again.. Check my post history. Short and sweet. First one telling you what I was going to do. Second one I just posted showing >700% gaines over the last month. Now I'm about to do it again, and once again I'll tell you what I'm doing. It's up to you if you want to follow it. If not that's totally cool with me. No hard feelings. 

This time I'll be putting my money into a few different calls. But I'll skip the ones you already talk about on here and go straight to the sleeper. Infosys. 

I feel like posting a ton of DD is worthless because I have my main account that I do that from and it's always getting ignored. So from now on I'm just going to tell you my plays. And then over time once I've proven my plays with consistent success it'll speak for itself. But in a nutshell,

Infosys is about to run the game. They've signed giant clients recently. Resigned some big ones (which is good because it means the ones using them like them). And they've released their new plan, to expand and nobody's touching them. They're public relations is great, people genuinely like them. They're relevant with their outreaches in a way that's going to allow them to tap into the social media fads and make them valuable to their clients. They are taking dinosaurs and bringing them up to date in a time where companies are scared of the idea that lockdowns are now a reality they must prepare for. So you'll see many more companies trying to update their business models to remain relevant and connected online. 

Anyway that's already too much info for this subs attention span so here's some rockets and miscolored charts. 📈📉📈🚀 🚀 🚀. 

INFY $16c 04/16 (or February if you don't want to wait that long)

Also for a bonus I'm back on Curevac. MRNA is about to get a lot of publicity because of covid and they're going to be the leader of the pack in that department.

I just started LoR to test the waters, and wow - the progression system is so fun! What's more, there's a free way to get into a seasonal tournament with a top prize of $10,000, and it goes regularly. Will I ever come close to winning?

Is this priced in? already? Democrats are probably going to get a super-majority in the state legislature this year after the votes have been counted.

In 2018 the NYC comptroller published a report saying that NY State could get roughly 3 billion in cannabis sales per year. So far my research has been reading [this article](https://www.greenmarketreport.com/these-are-the-top-new-york-cannabis-companies/), which says $MMEN will benefit the most because they have the most ny state permits. Unfortunately, this company is only on the CSE and has a current share price of like 0.18 so that fucking blows.

Demand for power fluctuates heavily during the day. This is well documented and called the Duck Curve - people leave their homes for work, etc, come back at night, air conditioning, heating, etc.

The power grid is actually a marketplace - where individuals actually can sell back power to the power grid to help make up for periods of increased demand. 

Solar and Wind have actually exacerbated the problem because solar and wind energy generation fluctuates a lot - you only get solar during the day, wind is unpredictable etc. 

The power grid also does not store power for a variety of logistical reasons. 

Theoretically, if you have a lot of power, you can sell back power to the power grid at the times it needs it the most to make massive profit.

The company, NUVVE has a software that basically creates a “virtual” power grid by taking advantage of the growing trend of electric vehicles. 

Cars only are used \~ 8% of the day, and electric cars have huge batteries so their business model is to write software into electric vehicles and use their battery storage to sell power back to the power grid when the grid requires it.

They manufacture batteries and have a partnership with multiple electric bus and vehicle companies that are billion dollars (Blue Bird, Lion Electric, etc) - so they are not current operators of electric vehicles, they just sell batteries to them. This makes them extremely asset light.

I can buy a house with this shit but taxes are gonna fuck me up if I withdraw early.

Due to the CARES act, you can withdraw early without the 10% penalty if you get the Rona, so I just need to go to some bars in Huntington Beach near my house.

I figure if I withdraw $10k and yolo it, there's only upside. I only have to pay income tax on the first $10k, then all the profits are short-term cap gains.

- If I turn $10k into $20k, my tax basis will be approx 5700k ($3500 inc.tax on $10k + 22% short term on 10k.) 
- On the flip side, withdrawing a flat 20k from my IRA would cost me 7k.

- If I turn $10k into $40k, my tax will be approx 10,100k ($3500 inc tax on $10k + 22% short term on 30k. 
- On the flip side, withdrawing a flat 40k from my IRA would cost me $14k.

The better the yolo, the more monies I have to buy a mansion or yacht.. Is my math correct here?

Clean Power Capital ($MOTNF) just announced their acquisition of the company POWERTAP which entered with a partnership with Cryotek to create the next generation PowerTap hydrogen filling stations that could produce up to 1000 KG+ hydrogen a day. Hydrogen industry is set to take off in the next few years with most large countries pulling in funds to compete to build up the best hydrogen infrastructures as it is seen as the move to 100% clean energy. PowerTap does it on site to eliminate the cost and complication of delivered hydrogen and easily secure your own dedicated hydrogen supply. PowerTap uses one of the smallest footprints in hydrogen generation to provide a highly economical hydrogen supply option, available within minimal lead times.

$CRSR P/E ratio is 55.4

$LOGI P/E ratio is 20.5

So $CRSR is overpriced right? WRONG. Price to earnings ratio uses net profit as part of the calculation. Why are you comparing a smaller's company profitability to a larger one? Given two well run companies, the larger company will always have more opportunity to do vertical integration and become more profitable.

If the smaller company is well run, it will eventually catch up to the same profit margins. So what you should compare is the Price to sales ratio which uses revenue.

$CRSR P/S ratio is 3.38

$LOGI P/S ratio is 4.67

So $CRSR is underpriced. And then we can calculate a target price for $CRSR $44.18/(3.38/4.67) = $61.04

- Has been maintaining the following EPS Surprise:

2019 Q4: +0.48%

2020 Q1: +85.75%

Q2: +27.91%

Q3: +43.16%

- Online Presence:

They didn't have a strong e-commerce presence a few years ago but are adapting quite well today. Offering Black Friday deals, Curbside, 2-hour Grocery Delivery, and Free Shipping.

- Covid:

I can say from personal experience (I've been shopping at my local store for many years now) that they handled it well. They were able to stay profitable because they didn't panic back in March/April and instead deployed the right policies to get people in and literally buy tendies and toiler paper. They were able to stay decently stocked thru most of the early pandemic panic and stayed profitable. I have no doubt that they will do an even better job this time around once shit really starts hitting the fan for round 2.

MAT and HAS are the two stocks I'm looking at currently to take advantage of. 

HAS - beat Q3 estimates during earnings and has had the highest revenue in the last 4 quarters while not recovering fully to pre-pandemic levels.

MAT - - same thing as above - only difference that this one is trading at it's highest levels all year, but looking quarter to quarter revenue and earnings is sharply increasing

Recently Bally's Corp (Owner of establishes casinos such as  twin River Casino Hotel, Hard Rock Biloxi, Tiverton Casino Hotel, Dover Downs, and Mile High USA) inked a deal 10 year deal with Sinclair Broadcasting and separately purchased online sports betting operator/tech stack [Bet.works](https://Bet.works) for $100million. 

In this 10 year deal all of Sinclair's Regional Sports Networks will receive the Bally's Brand. Sinclair receives warrants to purchase up to 30% of Bally's stock. This deal will enable live sports betting in real time through a reputable operator while the game is being broadcast as well as during commercial breaks.

Imagine you're in your wife's boyfriend's basement, watching the college you didn't get accepted to playing the college you dropped out of. During a commercial break you see the lines plus potentially a prop bet and with the bally's app on your phone you're able to place the bet and have a reason to stay awake for the 2nd half of the game. 

This could be a bigger opportunity than even draft kings as it won't be limited to daily fantasy sports but allow for direct sports betting.

Since the news the stock has rallied 60% but has pulled back recently potentially presenting a buying opportunity.

This news is only a few days old but analysts who have updated guidance are looking at $55-$65 price targets once the market digests what this deal can mean. 

As state budget's try to survive the upcoming pandemic related hangovers, expect more and more sports betting legislation to pass and this Ballys+Sinclair partnership has a nearly unmatchable reach in terms of audience reach.

Hey guys you might want to consider this EV company as they’ve been making some serious gains in the last month. 

GreenPower Motor Company is a Canadian electric bus manufacturer.

They’re bound to grow with the world moving away from fossil fuels and they currently have a market cap just under $700M.

The share price for GPV is sitting comfortably above $30 where as the likes of NIO is just over $50 as of today but their market cap is just over $70B!


I currently have a 125% markup on the GPV shares. I would have bought more but I trade on wealth simple and the buy option had been disabled 😒. 


I’d like to know what you all think about this stock!

#BrokeStudentTrynnaMakeEndsMeet_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ All aboard the Green Power Motors train 🚀🚀🚀 Alright you degenerates if you like making money on cheap EV stocks with huge upside, you’ve come to the right place. 

**GreenPower Motor (NASDAQ:GP) is trading currently around +22.00% on the day.** The Canadian EV maker provides transit buses, school buses, shuttles, and a double decker to commercial clients.

The upsides:

•The company more than doubled its sales over the past year while maintaining a 30% gross profit.

•**Currently trading at $500m market cap, leaves huge room for growth.** Doubling or tripling is not out of the question.

•IPO was in August.

•Delivered 100+ EV vehicles to mostly shuttle bus customers. Analysts believe GP will continue to help build the electric vehicle future by selling more school buses and electric delivery vans.

•The company expects to deliver 28 more EV Stars to Green Commuter before the end of December 2020, and 100 more in 2021; overall forecast of 132 deliveries in FY21 and 288 in FY22, up from 68 in FY20.

• With money raised from IPO GreenPower "can accelerate production, shorten timelines for deliveries, improve cost and terms from suppliers to support larger purchase orders which will be the drivers for GreenPower to attain profitability."

With all these EV stocks popping up,

# my next play is the merger of $THCB and Microvast

([Bloomberg article](https://www.bloomberg.com/press-releases/2020-11-13/tuscan-holdings-corp-announces-intent-to-combine-with-microvast-inc)). You might say, the merger isn't confirmed yet. That is true, but that's how you maximize profit before the news sets in. Bloomberg has never been wrong about any SPAC rumour except once (Topgolf). THCB will be able to sign an extension by Dec 3rd, likely to be beforehand)

Right now, without an agreement confirmation, $THCB has barely popped yet, shares and warrants are still cheap. There is virtually 0 downside risk, THCB shares are currently at $10.44, like most SPACs, you can redeem shares to $10 cash if it fails through, which is unlikely to happen.

&#x200B;

**So what is Microvast?**

TLDR: EV Battery Maker based in Texas, business focuses in Asia (China market is $$). One of the best EV battery techs right now. Already has 100M revenue this year.

It makes EV batteries based on Lithium Titanium Oxide (LTO) chemistry. Microvast's batteries have longer life, shorter charging times, and offer substantial lower cost of ownership by eliminating swapping station infrastructures required by buses running on LFP batteries.

[Their batteries powered the electric buses used in the 2018 Winter Olympic Games, it expects to generate more than $100 million in revenue this financial year.](https://www.reuters.com/article/microvast-ma-tuscan-holdings/ev-battery-maker-microvast-to-go-public-through-spac-merger-idINL4N2HZ3SI) Most other EV companies don't even have revenue yet.

If you missed out on CIIC train, this will be the next hype play. I don't expect it to have big jumps in the next few days, but the merger agreement with Microvast should come out within the next 2 weeks. Get in early before it comes out and jumps up 50%. Shares and warrants are both cheap as fuck right now. Once merger is announced, THCB will easily go to \~$20 range.

EDIT: **it is NOT a cannabis/weed stock. It is a SPAC to merge with a EV battery maker.**

The miners are all trading at the same prices as May, when gold was about 1700. It's around 1850 now.

As soon as the miners correct to rejoin the trend all the hype and bubble chasers will pile in.

Short blurb of a report from MF

Buy Magnite (Formerly The  
Rubicon Project)  
Tom Gardner and The Boss Mode Team | July 6, 2020 | Recommendation  
Magnite (NASDAQ: MGNI) (formerly The  
Rubicon Project (NASDAQ: RUBI)) offers an  
automated advertising platform that allows  
publishers and other content providers to maximize  
the revenue they get from selling ads. Magnite boasts  
relationships with publishers and application  
creators that reach more than a billion consumers  
worldwide.  
Magnite's 6x/10y Potential  
Magnite is the new name for the company formed  
from the merger of Rubicon Project and industry  
peer Telaria. The combination created the leading  
prospect to dominate the blossoming sell-side  
advertising industry, or the platforms focused on  
making sure publishers get the most revenue. The  
newly combined company uses a cutting-edge  
programmatic advertising model that makes it easy  
for clients to boost the yield on their ad inventories.  
Magnite is concentrating its efforts on the connected-  
TV market, which has been one of the fastestgrowing  
opportunities in advertising. As more people  
drop cable television, they've moved to streaming video services that are only now starting to take full  
advantage of opportunities to profit from ads. In 2019, Telaria saw its revenue from connected TV nearly  
double from 2018 levels, dwarfing the 23% growth rate in its overall sales, as well as pre-merger  
Rubicon's 25% overall sales growth rate. CEO Michael Barrett identified connected TV as a key market  
opportunity for Magnite in 2020, especially as viewership has increased during the COVID-19 pandemic.  
The addressable market for connected-TV programmatic advertising is huge, with one estimate  
projecting a value of $129 billion by 2023. Having developed key relationships with major industry  
players such as Hulu, Fox (NASDAQ: FOX), and Sling, Magnite has the inside lane to capitalize on this  
massive potential for years to come._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ NIU long term outlook after Q3 earnings report out today NIU just got their earnings in today and have dipped massively (14%), people were quite happy with niu, they are already making profit on their scooters and sell internationaly.

This designed to take advantage of a continued fall in implied & realized volatility) Expected Outperformance from 11/16/2020 to 12/4/2020 **Want to Avoid the Small Print (Condensed version of the trade is pretty straight forward it is a combo of Short Vol (Put/Writes) to fund long gamma profile) At the core it's a correlation trade, which will profit from lower realized volatility & wider correlations between equities -End Goal make 1,000 Dollars By 12/4/2020 :) \*Potential 1,000 in profit - (Exposure of 107k for two weeks)**

***Volatility Expectation =*** I expect the market to move less than 5% +/- over the next two weeks. Vix expectation is 1.13% to 1.57% (18 to 25) +/- and VVIX to move 7 to 10 points +/- or between 115 to 125

**Full Summary & Rationale For Trade** I expect the market to exhibit less correlation (<1) over the next few weeks. This in combination with a continued fall in Realized and Implied volatility over the next few weeks provides traders structural opportunities to profit. The trade is designed to sell elevated put/write convexity into the market to purchase a long At the money Call position on the index. Traders will assume the role of selling premiums via writing policies and also being long the index to profit from correlation widening. Profit from it

**Brief on Trading Suggestion**; We will temporarily be in a period of reduced swings up and down (lower realized & implied volatility)

**The rationale for the Trade;** The market will remain relatively range-bound over the next few weeks. This will present traders with the perfect opportunity to profit from selling volatility back into the market. A low return environment and possible negative curve (with Federal Reserve Balance Sheet Expansion acting as a useful backstop) invite investors to re-engage temporarily in seeking to exploit timely carry trades by selling volatility back into the market.

**The Risk for the Trade**; The risk is any large increase in realized volatility, which causes the equity market to move up or down greater than 5% to 7% this week. This would create substantial problems to the right or left side of the distribution curve. What we would like to happen is the movement of >4% and <(-4)% for the next two weeks.

There have been many companies coming out of the woodwork with new EV models. Any half-competent car company can design a sexy Tesla lookalike. The heart of any EV is the battery, and Tesla has traveled to the moon and beyond in large part due to it’s superb battery design and battery management. 

But the liquid electrolyte LI technology Tesla and all other current EV companies use will be eclipsed in the next few years by solid-state electrolyte LI batteries, which have twice the energy density or more, charge faster, and are less volatile/more safe. The company which emerges as the leader in this new technology will likely dominate the market for the foreseeable future.

While there are lots of little companies working on this technology as well as many of the established  players, only some have made significant progress. The most prominent is QuantumScape, a 10-year old startup out of Stanford backed with Big Boy money from Volkswagen, Bill Gates, and others.

[https://investorplace.com/moneywire/2020/10/this-bill-gates-backed-company-is-making-big-waves-in-the-battery-world/](https://investorplace.com/moneywire/2020/10/this-bill-gates-backed-company-is-making-big-waves-in-the-battery-world/)

[https://www.reuters.com/article/quantumscape-m-a-kensington/vw-backed-battery-maker-quantumscape-to-go-public-at-3-3-billion-valuation-idUSKBN25U2PE](https://www.reuters.com/article/quantumscape-m-a-kensington/vw-backed-battery-maker-quantumscape-to-go-public-at-3-3-billion-valuation-idUSKBN25U2PE)

Even though QuantumScape isn’t a publicly traded company it merged with SPAC shell company Kensington Capital Acquisition Corp.(**KCAC**), which is, for the express reason of going public through a reverse IPO. 

When the merged company becomes publicly traded it will use the ticker **QS** and this could happen as early as Nov. 25 th. Shares of **KCAC** will be turned into shares of **QS**, and even the exchange ratio has already been determined.

[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/kensington-capital-acquisition-corp-quantumscape-022100312.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/kensington-capital-acquisition-corp-quantumscape-022100312.html)

So oddly enough, you can get exposure to this company before it’s publicly traded. Stop chasing every wannabe Tesla company and ride with the next generation of EV technology.

Positions: 20CDec21, stock_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Evolus - Breakout potential (DD) Everyone is asking what the next cheap meme stock will be now that NIO and PLTR are too expensive. I present my DD on Evolus, Inc (EOLS). Trading at $4.07 / share. I’ve been following this for months.

**Background:**

Ever heard of Botox? Yeah it’s for boomers and it’s owned by Allergan, a massive boomer company. The market for Botox is roughly $5 billion.

Well Evolus makes a competitive product called Jeuveau that is targeted at Becky’s in their mid-20’s and 30’s who want to look good on Instagram. Now Botox/Allergen got greedy and sued Evolus. Evolus was at the time a $1billion market cap trading at $25 a share.

Allergen and their big expensive lawyers got a judge to screw Evolus and rule that they stole trade secrets, and Jeuveau got banned for 10 years from the US. As a result the stock dropped to $3 and change. Thing is, the judge screwed up, and if you look at the technology, there is no basis for Allergen’s arguments from a tech standpoint, they just have expensive lawyers.

The ITC is currently reviewing the case and are expecting to overrule soon. It was actually supposed to be last week but got pushed to December. Stock is up 16% on the news and as soon as it’s overturned we’re back to $24. Massive market potential that Botox hasn’t fought for and great branding on Evolus’ side. Stock was up 20% Friday on the news, another 2% today.

**Positions**

I’m long 4,000 shares and options laddered from 4/16/21 to 7/16/21 and 1/21/22.

**TL;DR:**

Cheap stock with massive upside on a ruling that is coming Dec 16th. Stock dropped on a bad ruling and will rocket when the ruling is overturned on 12/16/20._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ CIIG TO THE MOON 🚀🚀🚀🌝 If you rearrange and replace the letters of CIIG you get MOON. Coincidence?

Up 30% today. Up 120% this month. Buy before FOMO autists.

Disclaimer: own 43 stonks @ $17.40_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Learned enough about options so I tried it. _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ MEGA DD: BANGBUS EV going public - Everything you need to know (price targets to speculative Apple acquisition) and my $347K => $1.5mm bet 🚀🚀🚀 NFA! This is my **$347K bet** on the next EV company to blow up. In fact, its the only American EV company (besides TSLA) that's worth investing in. \*\*Flame suit on\*\* These are the reasons why this [Bangbus EV](https://i.imgur.com/2kzVCux.jpg) will absolutely dominate.

&#x200B;

**$18/$25/$30** **price targets for management to get paid** \- From the [recent SEC filings](https://imgur.com/gallery/OY7LYMl), management will unlock their shares at those price targets. Management has every motive to **PAHMP IT!** Commons are under $11 (as of now) and warrants are around $1.90. With the common's $30 price target, warrants would be worth $18.50 (**10-baggers with no theta burn**). With my combination of commons and warrants (positions below), at $30, this play would be worth **$1.5mm**. If you sat out on the other EV plays, don't miss out on this one.

&#x200B;

This company **made more money this year than FSR, WKHS, RIDE and NKLA, combined**. Unlike any other EV SPAC, this company is already making money as they have engineering contracts with Hyundai and [earning $34mm this year, and $120mm next year](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1750153/000121390020022608/ex99-2_051.jpg) (+258%). This revenue both validates their product, and is a solid revenue stream prior to releasing their vehicles.

&#x200B;

**Miles ahead of all EV competition** \- This company has built 13 driving prototypes and **completed 50+ crash tests**. [Fisker and Lordstown have built one prototype each](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1750153/000121390020022608/ex99-2_064.jpg), and have completed zero crash tests. This is the only company that's on-track to deliver vehicles on-time (2022). They've also engineered their own [skateboard platform](https://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/comments/jxk3rm/canoo_unseen_video/) completely in-house (unlike others who are relying on their manufacturing partners). In fact, they've built their platform in a record breaking 19 months, and the platform alone is worth over a billion dollars (cost for someone else to develop it). You can see the skateboard being thrown around like how your wife's boyfriend does to her in this [inspiring video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8m3fRujSlW0&ab_channel=Canoo). They're **engineers first (like Tesla)**, not dreamer designers coming up with a sketch and wanting someone else to build it \*\*cough\*\* Nikola/Fisker \*\*cough\*\*. The amazing thing with the modular skateboard is that any type of body can be quickly and cheaply adapted to it (e.g. bus/van, SUV, car, truck, parcel delivery van and etc) like [these](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1750153/000121390020022608/ex99-2_020.jpg) and [these](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1750153/000121390020022608/ex99-2_059.jpg).

&#x200B;

**Ridiculously low bar** \- Other companies have created unrealistic projections which will become their ultimate demise. Fisker ($17) plans to sell 250K units in 2025, when his last company sold a measly 2500 units before shuttering in a year.  **Yes he plans to sell 100x his last failed company,** *because it's different this time*. This company set a low bar of projecting a paltry 10K units on it's first year to hit its price targets. **They've already hit 10K members on the waitlist in California alone.** This company **under-promises and over-delivers**. I'd much rather invest in a company with management I can trust, rather than another Trevor Milton-like hype man.

&#x200B;

**Synthetic QS play ($20)** \- For those who couldn't get into QuantumScape/KCAC in time, the [Director of Battery Systems of QuantumScape](https://www.linkedin.com/in/phillip-weicker-p-e-a9998a2/) (you know, what the company is known for), **left to co-found this company**.

&#x200B;

**Synthetic ARVL play ($17)** \- For those who couldn't get into Arrival/CIIC, Hyundai invested in **both** Arrival and this company. Hyundai first announced it's investment in Arrival in January, yet, it still invested in this company just a month later in February. Why else would Hyundai invest in this company so soon after already investing in Arrival, unless it believes this company will be a winner? 🤔

&#x200B;

**Workhorse killer ($25)** \- From last week's Barclay's presentation, this company will officially unveil the parcel delivery vehicle next month. [This company's EV](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1750153/000121390020022608/ex99-2_032.jpg) has the wheelbase/footprint and nimbleness of a Class 1 vehicle (e.g. Ford Transit Connect), but the cargo capacity of a Class 2 vehicle (e.g. Mercedes Sprinter). This company's EV would be the best solution for a parcel delivery vehicle in cities where it's difficult to navigate/park and you'd want a compact vehicle, but also need large volume to haul a lot of packages.

&#x200B;

**Turo/Hertz/U-Haul alternative** \- In this [presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7tXveBvnt4&ab_channel=fullychargedshow) (5:00 mark), the Chief Product Officer indicated that the app would determine when the vehicle is not being used and **would allow (with your permission) sub-leasing/sub-subscription of the vehicle. This is HUGE.** Imagine having a money printer on your driveway. The vehicle is built around sharing/subscription (e.g. [Phone as Key](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201103005663/en/Kudelski-IoT-Enables-Secure-%E2%80%9CPhone-as-Key%E2%80%9D-Solution-for-Management-of-Shared-Vehicle-Access)) and it would be extremely difficult for other manufacturers to implement this in their current line-up.

&#x200B;

**I'M rEtArDeD aNd DoN't uNdErStAnD sUbScRiPtIoNs** \- This company plans to offer these vehicles as a subscription only. The **subscription is simply the evolution of a lease**. A subscription includes the lease, insurance, maintenance, DMV bullshit and etc all in one monthly flat-fee. The new vehicle lease market is huge, considering there are **4 million new vehicle leases a year**. The subscription is ingenious because similar to any other asset-backed security, this company can easily securitize the recurring subscription cash flow and essentially *sell* the vehicles to investors, clearing up capital from their balance sheet. Rather than a one-time vehicle sale, the subscription model earns [4x the revenue as opposed to just selling it](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1750153/000121390020022608/ex99-2_045.jpg). Furthermore, the subscription model generates consistent cash flow and more resilient than one-time vehicle sales. Imagine if the market saw this company as a subscription company like Netflix and it got their 78x P/E, it would have a $26B market cap in 2022, $65B market cap in 2023, $111B market cap in 2024, $182B market cap in 2025 and **$321B market cap in 2026**.

&#x200B;

**Subscriptions make sense for Uber/Lyft drivers** \- In my area, [leasing an Uber vehicle](https://www.uber.com/us/en/drive/vehicle-solutions/) is $150/week (standard) or [$229/week (premium, like this EV)](https://imgur.com/gallery/hQbo72a). $229 x 52 weeks / 12 months = $992/month. At $600/month including the insurance, maintenance, charging credits and so on, this is a NO BRAINER for Uber/Lyft drivers and will be wildly popular. Furthermore, the $229/week vehicle only has 5-seatbelts, whereas this has 7-seatbelts, so one could fetch the UberXL fares (+37% more over UberX) while paying the same amount per month *or less* for a better vehicle. I'm confident there will be a partnership announcement with either Uber or Lyft soon, especially since [Uber pledged to transition to 100% by 2030](https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/8/21427196/uber-promise-100-percent-electric-vehicle-ev-2030). I'm betting on the side of Uber, since there's deep connections to them like [this person](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucy-ross-863306bb/) and [this person](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-evans-69383b98/). This was even featured in the [Lido music video as a robotaxi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6m4kDMfNqg).

&#x200B;

**ThIs CaR iS uGlY** \- Yeah, tell that to [SOLO](https://i2.wp.com/electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/05/solo-header2.jpg?w=2000&quality=82&strip=all&ssl=1) investors and their single-seater death traps. New EV SUVs are in an overcrowded market. Why would you wait years for the Fisker Ocean, when you can already get a Tesla Model Y today? Every legacy manufacturer will be releasing an EV SUV soon, along with NIO's ES8 and Xpeng's G3. **The bangbus carves a niche in the market, where no-one has yet to go.** They're also making dope wraps to go with the car like [this collab with JGOLDCROWN](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VvvIbVU00&ab_channel=Canoo) as well as the [design company Off-White^(TM)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/comments/jxr338/canoo_x_off_white_confirmed/). Jay Leno, a car guy who can sniff out bullshit, [met with the folks from this company](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FIViMSeigM&ab_channel=JayLeno%27sGarage). It's what made me invest.

&#x200B;

**Steer-by-wire** \- This is the first company to use steer-by-wire. Check out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8m3fRujSlW0&ab_channel=Canoo) (0:23 mark) where they have the steering column in different locations. This means that it would be easy to adapt this vehicle to both left-hand-drive and right-hand-drive and opening to a global market. Most vehicles (especially ICE) it's difficult to convert because the steering rack needs to move over, which could interfere with other components under the hood. The HVAC in the vehicle would also need to be re-engineered. However, the HVAC in this EV is built right into the skateboard that's shared among all the platforms, making it very easy to adapt to new body styles.

&#x200B;

**Speculative Apple acquisition** \- Everyone knows about Apple's Project Titan EV car. This vehicle centers the driver around their phone, ***commence*** ***the Apple salivation***. Rather than one-time hardware purchases, Apple has been pushing recurring subscription cash flow like Apple TV+, Apple Music, Apple News+ and etc, and this company's revenue model is exactly what Apple wants. This company is also located in California, and logistically the best company to acquire. It also doesn't have a retarded egotistical CEO. In fact, the CEO, Dr. Kranz, led BMW's EV division to [build gorgeous cars like this.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/nargessbanks/2018/08/20/bmw-i8-roadster/?sh=27768ba31932) He also looks like [Doc Brown from Back to the Future](https://imgur.com/gallery/9X7k6av), so that's hella meme worthy. You see that big ass head? You know he's got big brains in it.

Also, here's some rumblings about the Apple Car-

>*the Apple Car could come in the form of an electric van.* *Apple’s engineers have designed specimens with black and silver paint, designed in the typical industrial design of the iPhone group.* *Apple also researches on its own batteries, electric motors, special seats and interior components.*

Now look at the [Apple's EV rendering and this company's EV](https://imgur.com/gallery/qgMkjLP). **I'll eat my dick on national television if you find another EV closer to Apple's than this company's.**[https://imgur.com/gallery/qgMkjLP](https://imgur.com/gallery/qgMkjLP)

**Positions**

**HCAC** \- 26,000 shares @ $10.57 => $30 | $275K => $780K

**HCACW** \- 40,000 warrants @ $1.75 => $18.50 ($30 - $11.50) | $70K => $740K

I just found there is a pandemic going on.

2 major players should be rolling out vaccines early next year. 

The FDA is reviewing Pfizer’s ~95% effective vaccine and should approve its emergency use mid December. The biggest challenge with this vaccine is that it must be stored in ultra cold conditions.

TMO makes the reagents for covid tests and is one of the major manufacturers of ultra-cold freezers (UCF). This stock was running up until November, and has been dropping lately, possibly bc Moderno announced their vaccine which doesn’t need special cooling and possibly bc their covid tests aren’t that profitable. 

However, I just checked, and more people are going to need the vaccine than will be able to get the vaccine. Many hospitals are trying to position themselves to be able to distribute whatever vaccine they can get their hands on, my wife’s boyfriend’s hospital is a real shithole and even they spent $16k buying a UCF.

TMO has a $178B market cap and is well positioned to fill this UCF need. BOFA recently upgraded them from hold to buy, and TMO just adjusted their projected earnings for next quarter (to be announced at the end of Jan)

In addition to the private sector, with their stability and global logistics network, they would be a prime target for government contracts to help with vaccine distribution efforts from groups like The Who (I love it when good bands go into philanthropy)

So since I've been on a mini hiatus from here. After correctly calling the DKNG/PTON/CRWD (Check post history) run-up & for those that got out early enough, some mini tendies on PM (if you held, I'm sorry, GTFO), I've been doing work behind the scenes & correctly called XPEV/NIO, CRSR, then TSLA. Proof below:

XPEV:

I still hold a majority of the above positions, though I've reduced some XPEV/CRSR primarily due to its run-up making the positions become too big. TSLA, even after my selldown is still a significant part of my portfolio.

With that said - here's some good ol' fundamental DD for you folks on my next play. **Huazhu Hotels Group (NASDAQ: HTHT)**. **This will be long, I'll try to be short & succinct & below I've included a TL;DR; but maximum tendies will be gifted to those who learn 2 read**.

**I. 30,000 Feet Up - China's 14th 5-Year Plan**

My HTHT thesis aligns with what got me into XPEV at the $20s. Even if you don't take my word for it, Google around - the foundation of the Chinese economy is based on Government policy. It isn't like the US, where big money drives political processes in the shadows. In China, decisions about medium-term / long-term business begin in the political sphere. So, on October 29th, 2020, the Chinese Communist Party ("CCP"), wrapped up after meeting for 4 days on the high level themes of China's [14th 5-Year Plan](https://www.ft.com/content/8e60bf15-2005-442c-ae59-e51d74a93856). The final details will be announced around March/April of 2021 (which drives my reasoning why XPEV/NIO & other related stocks should be held to after this date), at which the market will be able to apply more than estimates/qualitative assessments to beneficiaries of this plan. HTHT & XPEV/NIO fall under all 3 "Key Themes" of the Plan which are:

1. *Theme #1: Domestic Dependency - New Energy - Electronic Vehicles & Related Supply Chain (Battery Tech & EV Charging Piles)* \--> XPEV / NIO
2. *Theme #2: Domestic Demand / Theme #3: Digitization - Value-Added Products/Content* \--> HTHT

Other big picture drivers are ongoing Dollar weakness relative to the Yuan, China's outperformance in handling COVID relative to the US & Europe, both of which I won't discuss in great detail here but are easily researchable. These are all additional tailwinds for HTHT.

How successful has China been on implementing past "5-Year Plans"? Below is a nice infographic summarizing them. It's almost safe to assume that 5-Year Plan targets are the floor cases of what China is striving to achieve:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/jhech1vp0y061.jpg?width=679&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a873e9ed26e3ac980a38a7e435a67845b8d072a5

What are the benefits to Chinese businesses that align themselves with Chinese government policy? Cheap capital & outsized governmental support. *Put simply: It's like having a JPoW picking certain industries every 5 years to unleash the money printer on + having Congress pass very biz friendly laws in tandem.*

**II. 10,000 Feet Up - China's Only Trade Deficit - Service Sectors**

Overall, China has an overall significant trade surplus over the US (+$3.5 Trillion), but a deficit in the following 5 sectors - Domestic Travel, Discretionary Consumption, Entertainment, Education & Drugs & Medical Devices.

My view is that China will be pushing to create surpluses in all of them, but the most realistic sectors are in Domestic Travel / Discretionary Consumption (HTHT + XPEV/NIO) & a bit on the Healthcare side, which I'm exploring at the moment (DD to come). I still think US-based entertainment (Hollywood, NBA, etc.) will not be replaced in our lifetimes so let's focus on hotels.

Currently HTHT's portfolio is split by # of rooms 49% vs. 51% of total in the Upper/Midscale vs. Economy segment. Below is a quick summary of their portfolio of brands:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/wbtzyyg01y061.jpg?width=526&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fc8cde772bf3cdf54eb524c3aa2506d477cfba77

While many of these brands may not be familiar to us autists here vs. the brands Marriott / Hilton / Hyatt have, you can bet that with the signing of largest trade agreement signed in history - the [Free Trade Agreement](https://www.ft.com/content/2dff91bd-ceeb-4567-9f9f-c50b7876adce) & the quicker recovery from COVID in China, that these brands will be on flagship real estate assets across the world in the near future.

As an aside, Wall Street estimates that HTHT grows Room count by \~30% from year end 2020 to year end 2021, for an eventual mix weighted more towards the Upper/Midscale segment (56% vs. 44%, Upper/Midscale vs. Economy)

**III. Ground Level - HTHT Business Strategy & Financials**

So a very quick primer on how Hotels make money. There are 2 strategies - franchise / leased/operated. The Franchise strategy is higher margin, higher certainty of cash flows, is lower volatility, and captures *some* upside if business improves drastically. The leased/operated model is lower certainty of cash flows, higher volatility, and receives a bulk of outsized upside in the business. Overall, investors assign a much higher multiple to the franchise model. Taking a look at Marriott's historical EV/EBITDA vs. Host Hotels (HST)'s will show you this clearly. (Marriott trades >20x, HST \~10-15x)

Basically, how all the current major hotel brands started, like Marriott, was by having a primarily leased/operated model then when their brands began gaining awareness, spun-off their leased/operated business (usually to a hotel REIT) & became a primarily franchise business. This has been the path of all of the major hotel chains in the past, & if you were an investor in Marriott then, you made out like a bandit today (15x gains through time period).

Currently, HTHT's Revenue mix of franchise / leased/operated hotels is 31%/69% by Revenues. According to a survey by Frost & Sullivan in July 2020 on the Chinese consumer, HTHT's brand, HanTing Hotel is the #1 economy hotel brand that is 'top of mind' for the Chinese consumer & HTHT's midscale brand JI Hotel is #1 in the midscale segment. Brand momentum outside of the US has steadily been climbing for years which coincides with the Company's recent shift in becoming 'asset-lite' or in autist speak, are going to pursue a primarily Franchise model.

With that said - Wall Street estimates HTHT's franchised business is set to grow by >100% from '20 to '21, and the Revenue mix is set to go from 69% from Leased/Operated today to low 60%s by '22E.

This will be driven by a quicker & already recovering economy in China + global expansion backed by government policy.

Here's a snapshot on China's hotel recovery vs. other major cities per STR (based on RevPAR - Google if you don't know what this is - this is the main Hotel Revenue metric combining ADR & Occupancy):

&#x200B;

[Pay attention to growth from Aug '20 to Oct '20 - Beijing +51&#37; vs. London -3&#37; vs. Hong Kong +37&#37;](https://preview.redd.it/mnp64ghz4y061.jpg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=12f25ffa0170142def79515f52e866541dd42100)

[Beijing +51&#37; \(from earlier\) vs. NYC +2&#37; vs. Tokyo +79&#37; - Overall: Asia's travel sector is recovering](https://preview.redd.it/1jxte0vg5y061.jpg?width=1055&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3174187b78f1464457ac337219ba274901becd5d)

*In addition to the above RevPAR metrics, something else to note from the numbers. At Beijing's $55.01 RevPAR, they are >50% recovered from the average RevPAR throughout 2019 vs. London where current RevPAR is still \~20% of what they accomplished in 2019. Though Tokyo had some massive growth, they are still only \~33% of 2019s RevPAR*

Have you read this far yet? Lucky you - you get my exit strategy. $65/Share.

**So they're just going to be the Chinese Marriott - so what? What** ***differentiates*** **them like XPEV/NIO?**

**Growth.**

The Hotel industry hit the shittiest of shit recently, so all of them are coming off of ridiculously low bases. Even then, HTHT is expected to grow their EBITDA from '20 to '22E at a +209% CAGR vs. Marriott at +62%, and Hilton at +57%.

These estimates are extremely conservative in my view - downplaying HTHT getting the backing like NIO/XPEV to *export* its product overseas + the rapidly recovering Chinese economy relative to the US. Again, you will see their brands become flags in major cities in the coming years.

From a Valuation perspective, HTHT has had a decent run-up in the last month since the CCP unveiled the rough outline of their 5-Year plan, & they released [preliminary 3Q'20 results](https://www.nasdaq.com/press-release/huazhu-group-limited-announces-preliminary-results-for-hotel-operations-in-the-0) (which show a much improved/improving outlook - significant recovery in mid/upscale brands) but it is still undervalued in my view relative to the major Hotel peers. This is evident in EV/EBITDA.

Even with the conservative case of 3x the growth embedded in estimates vs. Marriott, HTHT trades at EV/EBITDA of \~20x, vs. Hyatt at \~24x, Marriott at \~19x, & Hilton at \~19.5x. Historically, Marriott has traded at \~22x when expectations for growth were a lot lower than they are today.

**Conclusion:**

**I see HTHT getting to >22x EV/EBITDA very quickly or \~$70+ a Share, and this is on estimates that do not fully account for franchise expansion on CCP support.**

**TL;DR $55C+, 3/2021 & beyond**

For those of you who haven't heard of it yet, *Queen's Gambit* is set during the Cold War era, where orphaned chess prodigy **Beth Harmon** struggles with **addiction** in a quest to become the greatest chess player in the world.

[Elizabeth \\"Beth\\" Harmon](https://preview.redd.it/zmngfzd64y061.jpg?width=3600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2b27e24ffbc543296bc6e4891d0c5f19074a3811)

Congratulations, you've read this far. So you might be thinking: *"What the fuck does a queen and a gambit have to do with my autistic NIO-buying ass in a DD?"* Yes, I will begin to explain why watching this series has inspired me to change my entire trading strategy. If you can't see it yet, I don't blame you. You have to kind of be retarded to see the relationship here.

Beth was an **addict**. You are an **addict.**

Beth became good at chess when she freed herself of her **addiction.**

You can become good at trading if you free yourself of your **addiction.**

**Please stop yoloing fucking FDs**.

[Your addictions](https://preview.redd.it/hpgcpbt84y061.png?width=1980&format=png&auto=webp&s=139c872572d592309adef5aeafa3076bfc845416)

Yes, I know. This is **Wall Street Bets.** But deep down, you are hurting, aren't you? You know that you aren't a real chad, and you are so beta that the covariance of your returns relative to the market is so much greater than the market variance. Day by day your losses repeat themselves, and all you want to do is to start seeing some green in your portfolio for Christmas season. Then you can get yourself a girlfriend so that you, your wife, your girlfriend, and your wife's boyfriend can start going on double dates instead of third wheeling all the time.

So this brings us to the question: "***what should you do to start winning?"***

[Your portfolio](https://preview.redd.it/w72jbsia4y061.png?width=1980&format=png&auto=webp&s=e7311d5b126d6039f99e0fc2ef7d0dfa4dc8aecf)

The answer is to start **selling options**. Imagine that for every loss you have ever incurred, your wife's boyfriend was on the opposite side of the trade, sniggering at you as you reach into your wife's purse to take our her credit card, deposit your funds into Robinhood, and purchase $NIO calls. He knows that $NIO calls are simply a means for you to transfer money into his pocket. He happily collects the premium that you just paid and drives off to Wendy's to collect his $4 for 4 happy meal. As he drives by, he sees a figure behind the dumpster, on his knees, and gives thanks to the lord that there exists a retard in this world that can feed him.

**CAN YOU NOT DESPISE THIS MAN? HE IS SO SUCCESSFUL! THIS COULD BE YOU!**

[Beth beats Borgov](https://preview.redd.it/2racqu7g4y061.png?width=1512&format=png&auto=webp&s=ab08f4c47de45575f83f170483f4a891b8cb5479)

At the end of the series, Beth eventually takes down the Russian Grandmaster Borgov. I found this scene to be particularly insightful because it shows how one can overcome his/her addiction to eventually achieve true success. I encourage the members of WSB to take this Thanksgiving week to think about what their addictions are, and what steps they can take to achieve freedom.

- Q1 2021announcement still on track with merge shortly after
- Leveraging current 13-F filers and big name IPO backers

Bill Speaking :

“So Pershing Square Tontine Holdings, I’m not going to be able to say much here up for obvious reasons. This is an entity where the most material development is when and what company we ultimately end up merging with and I really can’t give you information about that.

But what I can say is when we took these entities public, our proposition was, if we could create the most investor-friendly spec in the world, we could recruit the best investors in the world or some of the best well-known investors in the world. And we get also -- and we created the most merger friendly structure in the world, we could find an extremely attractive company that would want to go public by merging with us.

And you can now see a 13-F list of our investors. You can form your own view on the ones that have to file 13-F, but there are many extraordinary investors that don’t file 13-F, including sovereign wealth funds that own less than 5% of PSTH and the large number in the dozens of family offices globally kind of billionaire family offices that have -- that bought stakes in the IPO and we think this shareholder list will be -- and is actually will be an asset for us in finding a potential target.

In terms of timing, what we said at the time of the IPO is we said it would take us, we thought about six months to identify a target that we would be in a position to hopefully announce a deal by sometime in Q1 and then close the transaction in the ordinary course thereafter. Nothing that we have experienced to-date suggests that we won’t meet our expected timeframe”

Peter Thiel & Alex Karp 🙌_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Short/Sell MGM Someone recently posted about MGM being overpriced, I'll add to that. 

Today Nevada Governor announced new restrictions. Max capacity of casinos, bars, and restaurants are going from 50% to 25% starting Tuesday.



December is generally our slow season, and to add covid restrictions we had our occupancy projections pretty low. (17-25% on the weekdays, 40-60% on weekends). 

With the surge, we've had massive cancellations. New projections have us around 5-10% occupancy during the week, 30-40% on weekends. This forced MGM to close 2 more casinos during the week (mirage and mandalay bay, in addition to Park MGM that was already weekends only.) We're closing more restaurants and lowering operating hours for those that remain open.

Vaccine news seems to have given MGM a massive bump, but here's the real deal. The vaccines, at best, won't be widely distributed till summertime. Most of MGM's profit is earned during the peak convention season of January-May. All those massive conventions have canceled, CES included.

Summertime is very slow for Vegas, even pre-covid. Oct+Nov are usually decent, but then December is bad again.

2021 is dead on arrival for MGM resorts and all other Vegas casinos.

The massive run up to 26/27 made no sense. 

Positions: 12/4 $25 Puts. I got in on Friday when MGM was trading at 27.

Ok so i was determined to make a feb/march call on PLTR but learned about the lock up and realized that was retarded.

however, i still think there’s a chance pltr can go up in december. People may see that it’s low compared to last weeks high and buy in

OR

people will back off cuz of that whole lock up shit coming up

I want to buy a retard FD on PLTR for potential short term gains but it may be too retarded to work out. so i will be playing it like a boomer and miss out on potential tendies

edit: if you don’t know what a lock up period is, me neither but i read the tl;dr on this post

>They take data and organize it. 

And how does it do that? 

>Using tags and forms

That's really it. But why is a company that makes fancy spreadsheets worth billions? It's ability to get government contracts. The value is not fancy spreadsheets, but the ability to customize a product to fit government needs. Crucially they also have the ability to secure it. I honestly don't know of any other comany at this scale that does this many software contracts. We always hear about cloud storage contracts, but what about the software that goes on these clouds? 

Their total addressable market(TAM) in government is $63 billion with $26 billion coming from the U.S. government. The methodology is very specific, so I believe that they aim to capture all of it. If they capture ALL of it this would be 8,490% growth from it 2019 revenue. 

Where do we go from here?
Up, capturing government contracts is hard work and requires long negotiation and tearing away past contractors. This means the growth could take decades, but the revenue should be consistent.

Dear to all my brothers, sisters, autist, LGBT, gay bears !!!

Yes, you saw it right!
CDC declared level 4 for cruise ship. The highest level, it’s like you have a trip to Iraq and fight with ISIS. 

Vaccines for emergency only. Do ya think they accept cruise ship for emergencies??? 🤷‍♀️

20 mils vaccine until end of Dec. 
Ship wont go sea until April. CCL already take more loans for themselves and reduce 20% of their ship.



On Friday, we saw CCL, RCL, NCLH drops pretty much. 

So you have the code:

11/27 CCL 16p 
NCLH 18p

It’s pretty cheap atm. 

I bought 15 contracts CCL for fcking 240$. It have potential for 1000$ print. Why not ? 

Remember the time CCL jump 30% to 19.6$ ??? It dropped to 14.93 within 3 days. 

So why not 16$ p ?? It’s just 1.5 $ from now. 

On Monday, it will even more cheap if u get the right time. 


So broda, will you come Valhalla with me ? ? ? 
Just 200$ tickets to Valhalla._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Just Curious — insider trading? Random shower-thought type question here. 

Let’s say you’re some big time journalist or something right. And you do active digging through companies and such to find “hot” stories about the wrongdoings of companies. Then let’s say you find some biiiig baaad thing that only you know about a company or the CEO of the company or whatever and you know they’ll get negative publicity from it. 

So then you go and buy a bunch of put options on that company. Then you release your story and the company’s shares tank, then you sell/execute the options. Then onto the next one. Would this be considered insider trading? Probably not, but I’m just curious if this is a thing. Like I wonder if there are super successful journalists out there that invest in the stock market and do that type of thing. 

There’s no real point to this post, hence the shitpost flair, but just food for thought._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ who's this retard among us? _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Want to make money? Buy Dell Dell has earnings on the morning of Tuesday November 24th. Dell is a computer manufacturer along with other technology such as projectors, notebooks, printers, and headphones. You know what this means, at home working. Along with this part of business, it has a CLOUD portion. Yes this boomer stonk has a cloud business by the name of VMW. This allows them not only to sell computers but have a steady cloud business. VMW ware has shown consistent growth, with an average of 12ish % yoy. Cloud has obvious boomed during Covid-19, so you can assume VMW will have great returns this earnings. In addition for VMW, it has partnered with NVDA to make AI chips better.

[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/vmware-nvidia-partner-ai-chips-120728435.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/vmware-nvidia-partner-ai-chips-120728435.html)

Now the PC  sales will be fantastic as shown CSCO, LOGI, and Target. If you did not know all of these companies massively beat earnings. All of them sell computers, headphones, etc. Target is a massive provider for Dell's computers. 

Now I know some people will say Dell = Apple! It will miss!

But, Dell does not sell Iphones and laptops just for money. In addition, Dell is cheaper than Apple. Why would you spend 2k for a new laptop when you have a old one? With Dell, laptops can be under 1000 dollars, and people would want to upgrade for better ones/

They have a 3 sections.

VMW and computer which I covered but they have storage portion too.

I believe that because school came back, many people brought Dell computers and products for stay-at-home. In addition to VMW and storage revenue. Dell's earnings estimates have barely moved since Q2 and it provides for a great beat.

[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pc-sales-continue-benefiting-covid-102110153.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pc-sales-continue-benefiting-covid-102110153.html)

Also NVDA and AMD's new CPU's and GPU's are in Dell's products. If you wanted a new rtx 3070 or rtx 3080, or rtx 3090, you can buy it in a Dell PC. If you just look at AMD's and NVDA's sales you can tell there is great demand for their chips.

Now onto technicals, Dell broke their march uptrend line but has bounced off the lows and created a new uptrend. It is just below ATH which it failed to break 3 months ago. If earnings beats, it could fucking moon 10% or more. Keep in mind that Dell has gone up on past 3-4 earnings.

Now Dell's IV is low , with just 47%. So you will not get IV crushed that badly. Also, it is not a volatile stock, and max moves down are rarely greater than 4%

Also there has been lots of buying for Dell calls, on Friday 1750 12/18c were traded

12/18 68c and 12/18 70c_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Why you shouldn't invest in Roblox \- Constant losses from 2006 onwards, from the beginning. There hasn't been one year where they've made a profit.

\-ALL their employees earn over 100k+ (don't ask how I know lol), excluding their outsourced agents etc.

\- They are USELESS when it comes to managing data:

[https://www.vice.com/en/article/qj4ddw/hacker-bribed-roblox-insider-accessed-user-data-reset-passwords](https://www.vice.com/en/article/qj4ddw/hacker-bribed-roblox-insider-accessed-user-data-reset-passwords)

This was also an incident that occurred due to social-engineering.

&#x200B;

A data-breach means potential lawsuits for the company, and Roblox has had multiple databreaches in 2016, 2017 and 2018 and 2020. They have not disclosed these breaches via blog post or a sufficient medium, instead opting to do so through emails which they know are outdated.

\- It's very well possible that the company is exposed for hiring agents through iEnergizer.

This outsourcing company has shit office working conditions, making agents work in the office through the pandemic, and of course, shitty pay and not paying employees for months on end._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ DD for 11/19-11/22 American Eagle, Emerson, and Doomsday, TLDR and plays included **Welcome back to the WSB DD!** As in previous posts, the ticker will be in bold on the left and I write this so the info that I deem most “important” will be near the top. I would ask you to read all the way through to get the most information you can but honestly, I don’t give a shit. As always a follow-up from previous DD posts, TLDR, and plays will be at the bottom. Feel free to ask questions, I am happy to answer anything as long as it’s not stupid as fuck.

**URBN/AEO);** Now remember, I specialize in earnings plays. This is because they are the easiest to anticipate given the fact that nothing is easy to anticipate in the stock market. We all know what Urban Outfitters and American Eagle are, trendy clothing stores that are doing surprisingly well for still being in a pandemic. Here is why they are on my radar. First, these are companies that have rebounded well but still have room to go up, especially American Eagle as their price has been much higher. Second, every retail clothing store that has reported earnings recently has crushed them. It's the same story every time. [Childrens Place](http://investor.childrensplace.com/static-files/9821ff11-0580-47b7-8425-db47ee140512) expected EPS was .36, actual was 1.44 and they rose 10% EVEN AFTER already having risen 50% in the last month. [Shoe Carnival](https://investors.shoecarnival.com/news/news-details/2020/Shoe-Carnival-Reports-Third-Quarter-Fiscal-2020-Results/default.aspx) expected EPS was .7, actual was 1.03 and they rose 6%. [Kohls](https://s26.q4cdn.com/950703131/files/doc_financials/2020/q3/KSS-Q3-2020-Earnings-Presentation-vFinal-(11.17.20).pdf) expected EPS was -.43, actual was .01 and they rose 16% EVEN AFTER already having risen 32% in the last month. Do you see the pattern? Here's the deal, you wait until Urban Outfitters releases their earnings. If the pattern holds true then American Eagle will be a slam dunk. If it doesn’t? Well, I’m still gonna try because I’m a greedy bastard. I'm not gonna say it's free money, but I will heavily imply it and let you come to your own conclusions. This is the play I am most anticipating to make. I really think it's going to be a win. I could write more about this but I know most of you aren't even gonna make it this far before saying, "tO mANy WOrdS, i'M IN."

**EMR;** Emerson is an electric company based out of Missouri which has been around for 1890. They manufacture products and provide engineering services for a wide range of industrial, commercial, and consumer markets. [This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jxq3s2/emerson_emr_dd/) talks about how they make temperature shit and we will use that when transporting vaccines. Okay sure maybe. They make less than 25% of their income from “Climate Solutions” as it says in their [earnings](https://www.emerson.com/documents/corporate/emerson-reports-fourth-quarter-full-year-2020-results-provides-initial-2021-outlook-en-us-7186070.pdf). This means that an increase in contracts in temperature monitoring won't increase the net sales by enough to cause the stock to move up significantly.

The interesting thing about this company though, is that they keep a debt to asset ratio of 1 at all times. I can make a post explaining debt to asset ratios and what they mean for a company if you’d like so comment if you want to see that. They have continually done this for YEARS. I'm not giving you an exact date because I looked back every year until [2009](https://otp.tools.investis.com/clients/us/emerson_electric2/SEC/sec-show.aspx?Type=html&FilingId=7576151&CIK=0000032604&Index=10000) and they have had the same amount of debt as assets. This means they are very good at managing their debt and a company as old as this should be. Other reasons are that Emerson has consistently made money and will continue to do so in the future. Earnings were decent in light of demand going down so if they can make it through this with no more debt than usual then they can make it through anything.

The OP says calls but I sincerely doubt that it will move enough short term for calls to be profitable. Shares are the way to go given that the stock price is still below what it was before the crash. Emerson is not going away any time soon. This is a safe and steady stock to buy.

**Doomsday Bears;** Now I know all saw [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jx2zez/the_gayest_gay_bear_post_in_the_history_of_wsb_we/) which is calling for the market's doom. It goes over a shit ton of technicals and reasons why it is GOING to happen according to him. Sure the market is going to go down again, but that in no way means that it will happen soon. I am sure that weeks will tick by before we even get close to the possibility of it going down. Here are the most likely scenarios; Scenario 1 is that COVID numbers continue to go up and this thing doesn’t go away for a long time. In this case, the market will have another crash because it is being held up by the federal government. It will rebound but a lot more slowly than before because people won't be as confident as before. Scenario 2 is that this is the last spike, a vaccine comes out, and the market forgets about all the damage the WuFlu has caused. Honestly, scenario 2 is the most likely. All of this doesn’t mean that we won’t have dips. We will. But we, as the cucks of WallStreetBets, will make money on the up and down. As Warren Buffet so thoughtfully said, "Buy the dip, cuck." The best guidance I can give is to try not to get into long term commitments. Stay short term because we never know exactly when it is going to go down. When the decline comes, we will buy puts as is the WSB way. We will lose all of our money but that's okay because a well-timed yolo will put us back in gambling territory. We are strong, we are many, we are fucking idiots, and if there is one thing I know, it's that we can make and lose money off of absolutely anything. So we will.

**Follow up;** ebay ($EBAY) is at a discount after its drop Friday. Shares are cheaper now and I believe they will only go up as we move through the holiday season. Read the DD from 11/15-11/18 for more info. I am in the process of writing up my take on market psychology. Expect it sometime in the coming week. And in case any of you are wondering, I don't add huge popularity stocks on here like Tesla, NIO, and lately Butterfly. There is just an overwhelming wealth of information about them. This added to the fact that popularity makes a stock irrational leads me to the decision to stay away from them.

&#x200B;

Good luck fuckers and tune in Wednesday and Sunday nights for more WSB DD!

**TLDR;** Urban Outfitters and American Eagle are great candidates for an earnings play, Emerson is a great long term investment, Doomsday had not been predicted but you should still be prepared for it.

**Plays;** AEO ITM or slightly OTM calls if URBN follows the pattern, EMR stocks (or long term calls if you only do options)
