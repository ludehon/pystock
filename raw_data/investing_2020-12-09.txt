 Using a little margin for long term high dividend investing I must be missing something as this idea sounds too good to be true. I currently have a significant amount of funds in my brokerage, why wouldn't I bring my funds to Interactive Brokers and get margin for dirt cheap, then get a monthly dividend REIT, O, that would easily pay off the monthly interest on the margin, while the rest DRIP's. If I kept this margin amount low, such as 17% of my portfolio value, there shouldn't be much risk, it'd take a lot to get margin called. and over the long term the returns would be fairly lucrative._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ emerging countries and their markets Last day I was listening to an interview to a political scientist who told all the progress that emerging countries are making, in particular Pakistan and India hand in hand with China.

"The artificial intelligence software company C3.ai priced its initial public offering at $42 a share, above the recently increased range of $36 to $38. That wasn’t high enough. C3.ai shares opened for trading at $100 Wednesday morning and were up to $109 shortly after that, for a gain of 160% from the IPO price.

The company is selling 15.5 million shares in the offering, raising $651 million. At $109 a share, C3 has a market value of close to $12 billion on a fully diluted basis.

“JPMorgan analyst Ryan Brinkman has told clients not to increase their holdings in Tesla to approximate its weight in the S&P 500 ahead of its inclusion to the benchmark on December 21. 

The assessment from JPMorgan analyst Ryan Brinkman reflects some of the concern on Wall Street for the pace of Tesla's meteoric rise this year, which has added more than 660% to the group's share price and more than half a trillion dollars to the company's market value. Its net income for the third quarter of this year was $337 million.

Brinkman says Tesla shares are "in our view and by virtually every conventional metric not only overvalued, but dramatically so", citing a stock price that trades at 1,325 times its long-term PE multiple and 291 times its 2020 estimate.”_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Think the 60-40 portfolio is for Boomers? And that margin calls from r/WSB are too risky? Check out ARKK. There has been a lot of hype about ARK in the past few weeks. The 5 ARK ETF's have surged to daily record highs. This post will discuss ARK from the perspective of a new investor.

**What is ARK?** ARK is an investment firm that is in charge of 5 innovation ETFs. The CEO of this company is Cathie Wood who has gained fame for the stellar performance of her ETFs and her stock predictions. ARK is primarily an innovation series of ETFs. The 4 main flavors to choose from are genomics (ARKG), next gen internet (ARKW), autonomous tech + robotics (ARKQ), and fintech (ARKF). The 5th ETF is ARKK which serves as a combination of all 4 ideas. For simplicities sake, I recommend starting with ARKK since it is the most diverse. These funds are actively managed (and come with a higher expense ratio 0.75%) by the ARK team.

**Is ARK too high? Is it a buy?** If you are new to investing you naturally fear you are going to be the one to buy at the peak. It's really too hard to say where we are right now. However, this isn't r/wallstreetbets You're buying long term. The real beauty of ARK is its long term potential. The ideas that ARK are investing in have staying power. I am a biochemistry major so let's take ARKG as an example. Cathie's favorite healthcare innovation is CRISPR. This technology revolutionizes the healthcare industry due to its potential to genetically optimize crops, cure disease, and fix crippling disorders. Ultimately, this is not a fad. CRISPR companies will begin to soak up the massive revenues that old world healthcare companies enjoy. This is why Cathie considers ARK a "Value ETF" long term since the value will begin to shift to her companies over the 5 year timespan. Overall, you're never buying too high on this. Start with 5% of your portfolio and work your way up to perhaps 70% like myself.

**The Advantage of ARK**: ARK came about during the greatest financial revolution of the century. For the first time in history, small cap and young investors could be in the market for free. This has opened the floodgates of young people into the market. As Jim Cramer said recently, young people don't have the fears of old investors and prefer to invest in innovative companies. ARK is in the perfect position to capitalize on this trend. ARK has explicitly said that they target this brand of retail investor. Every year in America millions of people turn 18, millions download Robinhood, and millions of dollars flood companies like ARK and FAANG. If you invest in ARK you are taking advantage of this shift in capital.

**Disadvantages of ARK**: I hate to say it but a few disadvantages do exist with ARK. The first is the uncertainty. Ultimately, we could be wrong. Innovation could return to underperformance and the boomers could reclaim their glory. The counter argument is that nobody wants to be a horse investor in the 20th century. The other disadvantage is that you are usually going to be buying during an all time high. Innovation is highly volatile so it could look bad at first. ARKG is now nearly $100, but when I bought in at 60 it had tanked 10% and it was scary. The solution to innovation's volatility is time and the comfort knowing that you will always beat the 60-40 portfolio. 

**Overall**: Cathie Wood is the next Warren Buffet. She takes the time every month to upload a YouTube video of her thoughts on the market and how ARK is doing. Therefore, if you are a new investor and feel uncomfortable making the transition away from SPY, I encourage you to seek out these resources.

Array Technologies is a recent IPO solar play with a great fundamental product behind the stock. They provide hardware and software for solar tracking. It's essentially a single rotor rotating an entire row of solar panels on a solar farm, in order to track the sun's movements for optimal energy production. It's not a sexy vaporware technology, but it's damn efficient. Check their website for a more in-detail presentation of their products.

Array is the #2 provider of tracking devices worldwide, but I can see them grow to become the market leader in the next few years. The leader is a subsidiary of solar flow and its exact delivery quantities and revenues can't be determined as they are mixed in with the rest of their financials.

It doesn't take a foreteller to connect the dots for Array's success. As solar energy is growing exponentially globally, the farms that harvest the energy will need to optimize the energy their panels can gather. Array is a well-trusted American company that can help both public and private actors optimize their energy production.

Their growth-rate is in the **TRIPLE**\-digits, and their financials look rather stellar. Again, take a glance at their financial statements for more in-depth analysis. They have no long-term debt and have $27 million in cash. Oh, and the company is profitable despite of its rapid growth rate.

Their stock took a nosedive last week as one of the major stakeholders (hedge fund Oaktree Capital Management) announced they were cashing out. They're selling 25mil. Array shares, and might sell another 20-30mil. shares later. This represents 22.6% of the outstanding shares, so it's not a surprise that the market had a reaction to the announcement. However, this is not adding any new shares or diluting the existing amount of shares, it's literally just a hedge fund cashing out of their early investment. This sale will not result in raising any capital for Array, but it's just literally one shareholder selling their shares.

This dip was not a result of changing fundamentals, company operations news, analyst upgrades or -downgrades, share-dilution, or financial development. One could argue that the dip was entirely unjustified (I'd think it's just a hedge fund cashing out and looking for new opportunities, instead of some fundamental-breaking insider info), but I am for one, grateful for the buying opportunity.

The stock sits at $36,57 as of writing this (under its IPO price). The stock was at 47$ just a few days ago. P/E is 36,63, P/S is 5,07, and the market cap sits at around $4,6 billion USD.

As many of the solar plays have run-up (and for a reason) recently, some to some insane valuations, Array represents a great opportunity for those betting on solar.

It's still a new stock on the exchange so the stock could go up, down, sideways, or in circles, so I'm not going to give weather forecasts on this. But that being said, I see the stock as heavily undervalued for being a triple-digit growth company in the *green energy revolution* \-space. You could play this as a short-term bounceback with some great gains, or you can play long-term and hope for a multi-bagger. Your move.

**Before Apple Silicon:**

* Apple will ship \~17.5m Macs this year, representing about 11-12% of total U.S. PC market.
* A very small percentage of those Macs can play any AAA games
* If only 20% of Macs sold are Macbook Pros 16" or better with a 5300m+ GPU, then that means if developers port their AAA games to the Mac, they'd be targeting only 2% of the PC market. That's a lot of work for a very small TAM.

**After Apple Silicon:**

* The M1 is as fast as a 1060 in gaming
* The 1060 is also the most common GPU according to the Steam Survey
* This means AAA developers have to make games playable on the 1060
* 50% of all Steam gamers have a quad-core or dual-core CPU
* The M1 is more than 2x faster than the most common Steam CPUs in both single-thread and multi-threaded benchmarks
* Cyberpunk, the biggest AAA game this year, targets an RX 470 and an i5-3570K in minimum requirements. The M1 is faster than the RX 470 and more than 2x faster than the i5-3570K.
* The M1 will the slowest Mac chip Apple will ever make. Expect Apple Silicon chips to get [much more powerful](https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/07/apple-silicon-macbook-pro-imac-pro-2021/).
* All this means every Mac sold in the near future will be capable of playing AAA games.
* Ming Chi Kuo predicts that Mac shipments will increase by [100% within 3 years](https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/02/kuo-two-macbook-pros-2021-and-macbook-air-2022/) due to Apple Silicon, which means Macs will ship 35m units each year
* Every single one of the 35m Macs sold will be able to play AAA games
* For comparison, the total number of PC gaming computers sold is [35m in 2019](https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS45559419).
* All this means in 3 years, Macs will be 50% of all computers capable of playing AAA games sold each year
* For AAA developers, that means the TAM for them goes from \~2% right now to about 50% within 3 years

**Does this matter?**

* Yes. Apple is already the largest gaming company by revenue. Apple's gaming revenue is larger than Playstation and Xbox combined.
* Apple is serious about gaming but had no way of reaching the AAA market prior to Apple Silicon
* Apple wants to promote Apple Arcade
* Apple wants a cut of AAA game sales, ala Steam
* Having AAA games on the Mac will convince many Windows-holdovers to switch

**More thoughts:**

* Ming-Chi Kuo predicts \~24% market share for the Mac within 3 years. I'm even more optimistic. I predict 50% market share within 5 years.
* I expect Apple to release a $700 Macbook SE within 2 years
* This $700 Macbook SE will have a chip that is faster than any Windows laptop. A $400 iPhone SE right now is faster than any Android laptop.
* iPhones own 50% of the U.S. market. iPads 65% of the tablet market. Apple Watch owns 55% of the SmartWatch market. But Macs own only 11-12% of the PC market. An affordable Macbook is the key to bringing these customers back into the Apple ecosystem.
* Adding one more major device to their customer's ecosystem will make it more likely for the customer to subscribe to Apple's services

We find that costs built into the SPAC structure are subtle, opaque, and far higher than has been previously recognized. Although SPACs raise $10 per share from investors in their IPOs, by the time the median SPAC merges with a target, it holds just $6.67 in cash for each outstanding share. We find, first, that for a large majority of SPACs, post-merger share prices fall, and second, that these price drops are highly correlated with the extent of dilution, or cash shortfall, in a SPAC. This implies that SPAC investors are bearing the cost of the dilution built into the SPAC structure, and in effect subsidizing the companies they bring public._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Tool to determine reliability of market analysts ? Hi everyone, this is my first post on this reddit and I am looking for what I would assume is basic knowledge.

I have been reading and learning about the stock market for a while and I am seeing a lot of analysts talking about stocks and would like to know if there is a specific tool or website that could help me determine the reliability of their analysis based on their past advice.

Some kind of simulator that would let you choose a certain stock, an entry date (from the past) and a beginning amount and see how much your investment would have grown over time. I assume it would be possible to calculate it according to the price of each share and looking at their price evaluation through time but I was just questioning myself about whether or not a certain tool could help me with that. I am trying to make different simulations and try to put them all on the same level to compare apples with apples. Of course I know that their advice should only be the icing on the cake to confirm your information based on your own research but that is out of pure curiosity.

I am sorry if this seems like basic knowledge but I have tried searching on the internet and I think that my capacity of searching in English is reduced since it is not my first language.

Thanks in advance for your help and happy trading!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Tax Withholdings and Investing Strategy Aside from lowering expenses and maximizing income, I was trying to figure out ways to maximize how much money is in my investment account at all times.  

One way I thought about doing this was to change my tax withholdings so that my take home pay was much higher, which would let me invest more and keep it in the market for way longer.  Ideally my monthly paychecks weren't taxed, and then at the end of year or when filing my taxes, I'd just pay all the tax at once in a lump sum. 

The total tax burden would be the same either way, but delayed taxes would let me keep more money in the market longer.

Think about this, airplanes can already fly and land themselves, yet they still have 2 pilots. For crying out loud, trains that move along a fixed one dimensional track, still have an engineer on board who drives. 

Self driving at this point is nothing more than adaptive cruise control with lane assist even for Tesla. It’s impressive, but worthless unless the driver can be free to not pay attention completely. If you’ve seen real videos of Tesla’s driving in town, they are constantly screwing up and the driver has to take over. There are just way to many random variables for a computer to account for right now. The technology will get better but it will take too long for it to be self functioning.

My final point is that even if self driving becomes much better, the law suits from the occasional fatal accidents will drown any company that allows the driver to be completely inattentive. A morbid comparison can be made with inmates on death row, the legal fees and court proceedings cost more to make a death sentence than to feed and house an inmate for life. 

“Self driving” will be valuable as an added safety measure to accompany drivers, but won’t be able to replace for a very long time. I would like to hear y’all’s thoughts as well._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Thoughts about investing in CIIC Hello folks,

Doing really well in a specialized category (pet stuff) when both Amazon and Walmart have pet stuff as well. Presumably a lot of people who have Prime or go to Walmart still decided to make an account with Chewy and consciously decide to buy pet stuff from there vs Amazon or Walmart.

What’s the reason given prices are pretty competitive across all three sites? 

A few theories: 

1) For certain categories of goods generic filters aren’t good enough to make it easy to shop. Chewy makes it easy to browse by pet type, very specific categories for each type of pet, and category subtypes. 

On Amazon or Walmart, the only filters for all types of goods are pretty limited to things like Prime shipping, price, brand, etc. That makes it harder to shop for very specific things like pet supplies. 

2) Consumers care more about quality for certain categories of goods like things for their pets (they’re alive!) and will seek out specialists over generic big box stores (which would include Amazon) because they feel like a specialist will be more knowledgeable or have a better selection of goods to cater to them. 

3) It’s specific to Chewy. They have built a reputation for having good customer service and people appreciate that. 

Thoughts? Can this analysis be applied to other competitors?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Thought on WMT and their debt shelf? What are your thoughts about Walmart asking for a debt shelf? 

Big acquisition incoming, like Walgreens, FedEx, etc?

Or do you think they need the funds for some other purpose?

I’m currently long Walmart and love the direction of the company. With how overvalued everything is these days, it actually feels relatively cheap for how dominant they are. 

Sure they are growing by single digits, but that’s more a function of scale. After all if Walmart grows at 4% it’s the equivalent of Netflix growing at 100%.

That said I love the move into health, Tiktok (if it happens), and India. I think they could get back to double digit growth again in the future._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ With AirBNB IPOing do they really have a moat As of now AirBNB seems to have the home sharing market on lockdown.

(Recall other recent Nokia disruptive tech news includes the NASA lunar 4G contract, DOD 5G test beds, Bell Lab’s human augmentation and quantum computing.) That news stacks with rumor today from Deutsch Telekom: “I am particularly pleased that with Nokia we have also been able to win a strong European partner for our co-operation in O-RAN.” Highly anticipated catalysts these next two weeks speculated to possibly include EU Commission patent news against Daimler and Lenovo, DOD 5G contract update, and Capital Market Day on December 16 for the new Nokia strategy with speculation about possible divestment or merger/acquisition potential. Meanwhile, Finland’s largest investor state fund Solidium keeps growing its activist stake to 5.2% beyond its original stated threshold of 5.01%, and Finland just knighted Nokia employees the Order of the White Rose while passing the Telecom Act to ban suspect telecom competitor’s gear. All this means Nokia is earning backing from friends in the highest places as they show more confidence in its turnaround plan, further propelled by aggressive cost-cutting and streamlining. Highly undervalued at this price for the world’s second largest telecom by market share.

BNY is the largest global custody bank in the world, with about $38.6 trillion in under custody and administration. BNY Mellon’s asset management division manages over $2.0 trillion in assets.
