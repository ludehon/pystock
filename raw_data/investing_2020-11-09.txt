Can any Investors help me calculate CAGR properly on a Stock's business fundamentals ? I'm a little confused on calculating CAGR. Let me give an example of what I'm trying to calculate ...

Just had a grandparent pass away and found some preferred and common stock left behind from K-T Oil. Searching online hasn’t turned up much about the company, so any recommendations on what to do with it? Or if there’s even any remaining value to be had?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Brokerage Force Selling Stocks In Your Portfolio So I currently use M1 Finance. You can use margin in your account at a 2% variable interest rate. I searched everywhere on the internet and through margin agreements with the brokerage and I can't seem to find an answer to my question.

Can your brokerage force sell your stocks if your portfolio was ABOVE the margin requirements?

(Let's give a hypothetical scenario)
Let's say I have $100,000 portfolio and took out $10,000 in portfolio margin and bought SPY. Let's say 6 months later, SPY drops 10% below where I originally bought it from. If M1 Finance (for whatever reason) decided to force sell my securities to cover the call, would they be aloud to do this? Obviously I would be far above margin requirements but is this a risk that could/would actually happen?

The reason I ask is if (hypothetically) SPY were to drop say 30% or more I would consider taking out margin. I am a long term investor investing into safe dividend companies. So I would theorectically take out margin and invest into companies to hold them for years and use my dividends to pay the loan interest. If I only margin out like 10% of my portfolio then the only way I don't meet margin requirements is if SPY drops like 90%.

TLDR

If stocks were to drop 30% or more would it be a smart idea to take out margin to take advantage of the low prices of safe stocks?

Can a brokerage force sell your securities at any time even if you are well above margin requirements?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Where do you Specific Market research? The title pretty much says it all.

Coty is the number 1 fragrance company and the third largest beauty company.  Coty has lots of fundamental issues but it beat EPS by 0.35 and still has lots of value. Coty owns covergirl , 20% of kkw beauty & 51% of kylie cosmetics, they own fragrance rights for big luxury names like lacoste, Hugo boss, Gucci, dolce and gabbana, calvin klein,etc. These are just some of the vast assortment of brands coty owns as they dominate the fragrance industry.

The beauty industry isnt going anywhere and Coty is a big player in it.

(oops - title meant to say "surge", sorry)

* * *

U.S pharmaceutical giant Pfizer and German biotech firm BioNTech said their coronavirus vaccine was more than 90% effective in preventing Covid-19 among those without evidence of prior infection, according to data published Monday from their late-stage vaccine trial.

It comes as drugmakers and research centers around the world scramble to deliver a safe and effective vaccine in an attempt to bring an end to the coronavirus pandemic that has claimed over 1.25 million lives worldwide.

Scientists are hoping for a coronavirus vaccine that is at least 75% effective, while White House coronavirus advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci has previously said one that is 50% or 60% effective would be acceptable.

Albert Bourla, chairman and CEO of Pfizer, hailed the development as a “great day for science and humanity.”

The results were based on the first interim efficacy analysis conducted by an external and independent Data Monitoring Committee from the phase three clinical study. The independent group of experts oversee U.S. clinical trials to ensure the safety of participants.

The analysis evaluated 94 confirmed Covid-19 infections among the trial’s 43,538 participants. Pfizer and BioNTech said the case split between vaccinated individuals and those who received a placebo indicated a vaccine efficacy rate of above 90% at seven days after the second dose.

It means that protection from Covid-19 is achieved 28 days after the initial vaccination, which consists of a two-dose schedule.

The final vaccine efficacy percentage may vary, however, as safety and additional data continues to be collected.

“The first set of results from our Phase 3 COVID-19 vaccine trial provides the initial evidence of our vaccine’s ability to prevent COVID-19,” Pfizer’s Bourla said in a statement.

“We are reaching this critical milestone in our vaccine development program at a time when the world needs it most with infection rates setting new records, hospitals nearing over-capacity and economies struggling to reopen,” Bourla continued.

“With today’s news, we are a significant step closer to providing people around the world with a much-needed breakthrough to help bring an end to this global health crisis. We look forward to sharing additional efficacy and safety data generated from thousands of participants in the coming weeks.”

Roughly 42% of the trial’s participants had diverse backgrounds, Pfizer and BioNTech said, adding that there haven’t been any serious safety concerns reported yet.

The companies said they planned to submit for emergency use authorization to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration soon after they have two months of data, which is currently on track for the third week of November.

Based on current projections, Pfizer and BioNTech expect to produce up to 50 million vaccine doses in 2020, and up to 1.3 billion doses in 2021.

The companies said they plan to submit data from the full phase three trial, which began on July 27, for scientific peer-review publication.

Great run in the Shares of marijuana producer Tilray Inc (TLRY), surging last 3 weeks. This is a classic Tilray bull flag breakout stock chart after a week of bullish consolidation. Tilray ran from $4.40 to $6.70 two-three weeks ago. This was the beginning of the election cycle move they have predicted. Over the last week, it pulled back, forming a bullish inside bar/bull flag. Now the stock is surging 10% to $6.11 by lunch time. Based on the stock chart setup, this Tilray bull flag breakout stock chart has upside to nearly $12.00/share. Hedge funds are extremely underweight marijuana stocks based on a chance of a Democratic sweep. It has happened, vice presidential candidate Kamala Harris has stated they will legalize marijuana on a federal level. If that happens, these stocks are worth double or triple where they are trading. Hedge funds need to pile in prior to the election even just on the chance that happens. Tilray has a great stock chart and a ton of upside. Others include Aurora Cannabis (ACB), Canopy Growth (CGC), Cronus (CRON) and Aphria (APHA)
