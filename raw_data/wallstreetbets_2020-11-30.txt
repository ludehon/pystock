**Tldr; This is the future of car insurance. Buy now. These guys are going after Geico.**

**Search the SPAC ticker for metromile.**

Metromile is a SPACE run my Chamath Palihapitiya and backed by Mark Cuban– former FB exec, CEO of Social Capital, and the guy behind the Virgin Galactic SPAC ($SPACE) (see that run lately??)

Essentially, they are emerging with Metromile – a new age, user friendly auto-insurance provider. The basic premise of the company is that insurance should be individual, rated on a basis that ACTUALLY reflects how often someone drives. The big companies, the theory goes, have been gouging the eyes out of all of us for years without any push back. Chamath, passionately wants to change this.

**Some interesting background info presented by Chamath:**

One third of drivers drive most of the miles and get in most of the accidents. Despite this, they pay the same rates as everyone else. As a result, two-thirds of drivers are overpaying for auto insurance.

**Metromile specifics:**

\- offers personalized per mile insurance

\- fully-automated service

\- saves consumer more than closest competitor by 47%

\- has already achieved profitable unit economics

\- Importantly, ONE YEAR RETENTION IS BEST IN CLASS AT 63%

Here’s everything investors need to know about the Metromile SPAC merger (from [https://investorplace.com/2020/11/metromile-spac-merger-what-to-know/](https://investorplace.com/2020/11/metromile-spac-merger-what-to-know/))

· Starting off, Metromile is a digital auto insurance company that operates on a unique model.

· The company’s insurance starts as low as $30 a month and then it tacks on extra for miles driven.

· The idea here is that people that don’t drive often can save on their auto insurance with the company.

· Another division of the company is Metromile Enterprise, which helps large insurers transfer to the cloud using part of its platform.

· Metromile’s SPAC merger will have it taking over Insu Acquisition, which will change its name to the former’s once complete.

· This merger will also result in shares of the stock undergoing a ticker change and becoming shares of MLE stock.

· The merger deal implies a pro forma enterprise value at closing of $956 million for the company.

· It will also net Metromile $294 million in cash to work with once the deal is done.

· Dan Preston, the current CEO of Metromile, will continue to lead it after the SPAC merger is complete.

· The deal still needs to complete customary closing conditions, such as getting approval from shareholders.

· As long as there are no troubles, the SPAC merger is set to close in the first quarter of 2021.

· Investors eyeing the company ahead of the merger will note that it has a 76% average annual premium growth rate from 2015 to 2019.

· It’s also worth mentioning that it’s the largest pay-per-mile insurer in the U.S.

The stock will be added at its full float-adjusted market capitalization before the open of trading on Dec. 21, the index provider said. The company it will replace will be named on Dec. 11, according to a press release.

The decision follows feedback from the investment community, which S&P Dow Jones Indices sought due to the difficulty of adding a company of Tesla’s size. The electric vehicle maker will be the largest company ever to be added to the S&P 500.

S&P Dow Jones Indices announced that Tesla would join the S&P 500 earlier in Nov., at which point it said it was considering whether Tesla should be added all at once prior to the market open on Dec. 21, or in two tranches on Dec. 14 and Dec. 21.

“The fact that when S&P originally made the announcement they sought feedback from the investment community on how to handle the addition tells you all you need to know to show how unique a situation this is,” noted Bespoke Investment Group founder Paul Hickey.

Tesla stock has jumped nearly 40% since the announcement that it would join the index, bringing its year-to-date gain to nearly 580%.

Hickey attributed the recent rally in shares to anticipation that the stock will need to be bought by money managers.

There’s currently over $11.2 trillion in assets benchmarked to the S&P 500, with roughly $4.6 trillion of the total in indexed funds, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. The index provider said that Tesla’s addition will “generate one of the largest funding trades in S&P 500 history” to the tune of around $51 billion as portfolio managers sell positions in order to make way for Tesla.

“Where it gets interesting is in the other stocks that index funds will have to sell in order to make room for TSLA,” Hickey added.

Goldman Sachs recently estimated that Tesla’s addition could result in $8 billion in demand from active U.S. large-cap mutual funds. When index funds are thrown into the mix, that figure is substantially larger.

🚀🚀🚀_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ DD: AVTR (COVID vaccine play) Longtime sub lurker and part time YOLO enthusiast, finally deciding to post my first bit of DD here, take a look at AVTR:

* Avantor is a global provider of products and services to customers in the biopharma, healthcare, education & government, and advanced technologies & applied materials industries. 
* Avantor is about to participate in this vaccine production in a major way because 8bn doses of an mRNA vaccine essentially is going to double the biopharma production market. 
* AVTR is most leveraged to an mRNA vaccine through the supply of cholesterol. Specifically, production of an mRNA vaccine requires cholesterol and is more expensive per metric ton versus other vaccine raw material inputs. Essentially this all points to some major expansion in margins and revenue growth.  
* Just to give you guys an idea how much faster this business is about to start growing.  Their  bioproduction-related orders (which is higher margin and 50% of the business today) are up >100% YTD, which is remarkable considering more than half of the order build stems from the base non-COVID business and is going to accelerate once the vaccine starts massive production.  

TLDR - AVTR is about to print money thanks to Covid-19 vaccine 🚀🚀🚀

GUSH = x42 (4200%) = $420,000

ERX = x12.22 (1220%) = $122,200








**Key Points:**

* Price is dependent on $XOP and $XLE since they are tracked by these companies. I am focusing on the oil aspect (not raw crude prices) and supply chains. 

* Mixture of Energy ETFs (leveraged). Energy does include oil, I am focusing on oil. 

*  Highest yield growth in terms of recovery stocks/ETFs 

* If you really think oil exploration is going to end during EV, you’re very wrong. Boomers are just waiting for a recovery and have doubled up on it. 

* One of the underlying stocks is Chevron (NYSE: CVX) Chevron is engaged in every aspect of the oil, natural gas, including hydrocarbon exploration and production; refining, marketing and transport; chemicals manufacturing and sales; and power generation

* This includes the aspect of Fractional Distillation which has reduced in demand than normal during covid due to exportation issues. 

* To go deeper, fractional distillation is used for: Bitumen for roads and roofing. | Fuels for ships, factories and central heating. | Lubricating oils, waxes, and polishes. | Diesel fuels (many of the trains around the world still use this). | Jet fuel, paraffin for lighting and heating. (Airlines are starting to pick up in demand and many have started taking in bookings to prepare for flights &amp;gt; more consumption of jet fuels). | Petrol for vehicles (reduction in demand for this due to EVs and hybrids but this is the only aspect). | Chemicals. | Liquefied petroleum gas. 

* Biden supports renewable energy, but he would make sure the old money gets their run, as old money still runs the economy. - Leading to recovery. 

* Roads are still using to use refined crude oil despite the EV market. 

* These companies within these EFTs have invested heavily into solar energy, supporting sustainability, and adapting to changing markets. Which Biden is known for. 

* In terms of Leveraged EFT/Stocks = UCO (leveraged crude oil) used to be the reliable one but they changed their method to investment method because they couldn’t survive March 2020, so these are the best alternatives.  

* All companies within the EFT are reducing greenhouse gas emissions 

* It’s 3x leverage, what do you expect, high risk high reward. 

* Recovery Stock


**Risk:**

* Leveraged Stocks and ETFs are high risk high reward plays but cannot liquidate such as a leveraged/options contracts

* Gives common stock buyers and holders a high risk opportunity play. 

* TQQQ recovered higher than it did recover and that’s leveraged Nasdaq, this is due to percentage growth

* Leveraged Stocks and ETFs are high risk high reward plays this will include drawdowns. (Highly volatile). 

* High overhead costs but this gets isn’t a issue due to high cash flow of these companies. 

* If you buy leveraged contracts or options you’ll have deeper profits but hope you have enough collateral to survive the drawdowns. 

* This is high risk and won’t give you overnight returns but will give a decent gain only IF it works out.

You’ve been busy posting gain/loss porns all over this sub, but it’s almost that time of the year when you have to file taxes for Uncle Sam. This is also important because some of you retards will want to file taxes super early, receive refunds early, and throw all that money into weekly FD’s and other plays because ..... well ..... you are all sick bastards.

Anyway, let’s get the easy part out.

**If You Lost Tendies**

For retards who have trouble figuring out whether you won or lost tendies this year. Take your RH app, locate the line chart that shows your account balance over time. Click “1Y” and then take your finger over to around Jan 2020 Account Balance and figure out your account balance around that time. Then take the same finger and place it over around Dec 2020. If your Jan 2020 balance is higher than your Dec 2020 balance, then you probably lost money.

Wait till RH issues your 1099 Tax Form before you do anything, **but single filers can expect to deduct up to $3k in capital tendies losses each year.**

**If You Made Tendies**

Well, if you made tendies this year, congratulations. This means that you took your autism to a greater height and made tendies that your mom will be proud of.

Well, if you made tendies, things get complicated because Uncle Sam wants it to be complicated. Even though tendies are great, the taxes you pay are based on the time period you held the stock in your account. If you held your investment for a year or less (which is very likely for most of you retards in this sub), you pay a short-term capital gains rate, which is the same rate you would pay on the wages you earn from a working job.

**Uncle Sam's Bracket for 2020**

|Tax Rate|Single Filers|Married (Joint)|Head of Household|Married (Separate)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|10%|$0 to $9,875|$0 to $19,750|$0 to $14,100|$0 to $9,875|
|12%|$9,876 to $40,125|$19,751 to $80,250|$14,101 to $53,700|$9,876 to $40,125|
|22%|$40,126 to $85,525|$80,251 to $171,050|$53,701 to $85,500|$40,126 to $85,525|
|24%|$85,526 to $163,300|$171,051 to $326,600|$85,501 to $163,300|$85,526 to $163,300|
|32%|$163,301 to $207,350|$326,601 to $414,700|$163,301 to $207,350|$163,301 to $207,350|
|35%|$207,351 to $518,400|$414,701 to $622,050|$207,351 to $518,400|$207,351 to $311,025|
|37%|$518,401 or more|$622,051 or more|$518,401 or more|$311,026 or more|

So for retards who can't figure out the above table because you have never held a job in your life or you've been unemployed for too long, let's say your **taxable income** for 2020 (after all your deductions and exemptions) is $9,000 and you are filing single, then your tax is 10% of $9,000. Remember, **taxable income is after all the deductions and exemptions.** So even if you made tendies of $10k this year (and this is only income that you generated this year), you have to take standard deduction and other exemptions before you calculate your taxable income. Standard deduction for single filer for 2020 is $12,400 by itself. So in this case, you don't owe Uncle Sam shit if you made $10k in tendies. Confused? Who cares. Just say thank you.

**Long Term Capital Tendies Tax**

In an unlikely event that you've held your investment for more than a year, Uncle Sam will reward you with a lower capital tendies tax of 0%, 15%, or 20% based on your taxable income. For 2020, you can completely ignore taxes on capital tendies if your taxable income is $40,000 or less (single filers) or $80,000 or less (married filers). 

**Other Considerations**

If you have unrealized loss on some bad investment, consider ridding yourself of such position before the end of the year to offset against some of your capital tendies gains. Remember, short term losses are offset against short term gains first, and long term losses are offset against long term gains. Net losses of either type can then be deducted against the other kind of gain.

For example,

* If you have $4,000 of short-term loss and only $3,000 of short-term gain, the net $1,000 short-term loss can be deducted against your net long-term gain (assuming you have one).
* If you have an overall net capital loss for the year, you can deduct up to $3,000 of that loss against other kinds of income, including your salary and interest income.
* Any excess net capital loss can be carried over to subsequent years to be deducted against capital gains and against up to $3,000 of other kinds of income._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Bought my first options today!

I personally like NIO a lot and don't think you have to fear for it, but when I first invested in it a while ago one of the first things I thought about was Luckin coffee (was not invested in it but that was a train wreck after the news).

Well, there's some alleged news that KNDI, (Kandi Technologies) an EV and battery manufacturer was falsifying their revenue with fake accounts.

The stock has thus far dropped 35% today, nearly hitting a record, and proceeds to drop as we speak. And while I think NIO and XPEV are good stocks, there is always that dark side that we might not know about, and if we do - it's too late. So, I guess word of caution, let's try our best to stick to US stocks and at the very least if we lose money somewhat support the bozos on our end of the spectrum, because generally we at least know they're doing something.

Steven Mnuchin is in late-stage talks to settle 8-year long $300B FNMA shareholder lawsuits before Biden gets in in January. The Trump admin has committed to releasing Fannie (FNMA) from government control and has taken every step required to prepare Fannie for release with only one key step remaining: shareholder lawsuit resolution.

Trump admin will settle so that he can make good on his promise to release Fannie from government control and so he can avoid gifting Biden control over the $6 Trillion housing finance system that Fannie and freddie have a duopoly over.

Supreme Court hears the shareholders case on December 9th. Close watchers believe it gets settled before then because case is a slam dunk for shareholders. $300B lawsuit settled in shareholder favour by end of December and the market cap is currently only $3B. Means it’s at least a 10x from here. When the settlement news officially breaks, it will make headlines on every major financial news publication.

“Hedge funds get massive $300 BILLION windfall from Trump”

My position = 3000 shares.

&#x200B;

There is very litle downside to this play, and a massive upside, there has already been a few leaks of information which have shot the price up already, however I feel if you get in early at a $3 price point it's going to be a very easy play with huge upside and little downside.

&#x200B;

The entire market cap of FNMA is 3 billion, they make (before the government takes them) profits of 10b-15b per year. If this comes off, this will be an easy 10x before the new year. (IMO)

"The company's drug cabozantinib is marketed under the name Cometriq. Cometriq was first approved in 2012 as a treatment for thyroid cancer. "

In 2015, the company co-developed another drug, cobimetinib. The FDA has approved it as a treatment for various forms of skin cancer.

In 2016, a tablet form of cabozantinib, marketed as Cabometyx, was approved for patients with renal cell carcinoma.

In 2019, the FDA approved Cabometyx for the most common type of liver cancer. Revenue has grown from a paltry $25 million in 2014 to almost $1 billion today.

In 2019, management announced that its first internally discovered compound since 2009 had begun a phase 1 clinical trial

Just this month, the FDA granted a priority review for the combination of Cabometyx with Bristol Myers Squibb's Opdivo as a treatment for patients with advanced kidney cancer.

In a clinical trial, participants taking the combination had a median survival duration of 16.6 months -- double the 8.3 month median of those using **Pfizer**'s ([NYSE:PFE](https://www.fool.com/quote/nyse/pfizer-inc/pfe/)) Sutent

\- HCC is  a liver cancer is a leading cause of cancer death worldwide, accounting for more than 700,000 deaths and 800,000 new cases each year.

In 4th quarter of 2020, EXEL will be elgible to receive a $15 million milestone payment from Takeda upon Takeda’s first commercial sale of CABOMETYX for unresectable HCC

**This company has launched more than 70 clinical trials and 9 of them are in phase 3.**

what is phase 3?

=> There are phase 0 to phase 4 in clinical trials, and phase 3 trials compare a new drug to the standard-of-care drug. These trials assess the side effects of each drug and which drug works better. Phase III trials enroll 100 or more patients. Phase3 clinical trials are often needed before the FDA will approve the use of a new drug for the general public

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Risk Factor:**

"But while its potential as a thyroid cancer treatment was limited, Cometriq's intended market, prostate cancer, was a $1.6 billion opportunity. "

In 2014, Cometriq only extended the lives of patients by an average of one month -- not a statistically significant result.

The company is well established in the industry and even my dumbass pencil-and-paper doctor told me to use their app on a few occasions. Though Amazon's new pharmacy announcement caused it to crash last week. 

Here's the thing.... $GDRX isn't a pharmacy. It's just a service used by pharmacies to get more customers. It tells you what your prescription costs at every pharmacy around you, and offers coupons for prescriptions. If Amazon does become big, you better bet that CVS and Walgreens will need GoodRX more than ever to keep their customers... Either way the prices on GoodRX's app are better than 90% of Amazon's stock. And who's to say that Amazon wouldnt use GoodRX to pickup some of those new customers. The app is legit, it had my prescription listed for half of what I'm paying at a pharmacy down the street. So I'm long on $GDRX.

Here’s what you missed out on (11/30) _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Anxiety inducing volatility _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Long Term Palantir Position With my post nut clarity from all of your loss porn, I am gonna share with you how Theta gang gets off.

I bought 500 shares of PLTR at IPO for just under $10 (i.e. before options were available). I was quite happy to see them double to $20. I wanted to collect some profits, but didn't want to sell the shares, so I sold covered calls because IV was high. PLTR $35c 1/15/22 for $4.50 each, which was basically the longest dated highest value that was available at the time.

My timing couldn't have been worse because they were worth over $10 the next week. I bought 200 more shares at $25 and sold 2 more covered calls for $10.50.

Now my cost basis for 700 shares is about \~$14 minus the $6.20 premium, or around $7.75. I have $5500 locked up for the next year, but if PLTR is >$35 by 2022, the position would be worth \~$24.5k or \~350% return. If it drops to $20 and holds, it would be worth $14k or \~150% return. Hell, I'll make \~25% if it drops down to $10, which still beats most hedge funds. It's a 17 year old company with government contracts, it's not going bankrupt.

The point is, stop buying weeklies and think about longer term strategies. My position is down less than $100 today while a lot of you degenerates got crippled. Covered calls are your friend.

Getting taxes wrong may cost you money! And my write-up below is I think generally correct, but is not tax advice - for it to be tax advice I'd need to know your specific tax situation in great detail, and make an assessment, which I won't do. Id also need to confirm you understood correctly, and the replies indicate some do not. I think my post’s  guesses and suggestions are right most of the time, but they aren't precisely right in all cases 100%.**

You can’t be a serious trader without really understanding tax strategies. I know it’s some boring accountant BS, but it’s one of the few things, other than $420 TSLA calls and shorting NKLA at $50, that is actually free money. This should make it more motivating if your head is in the right place - making money priority #1.

Good tax decisions save you money in most cases with little or no change to your risk level. I regularly see people do stuff on this forum that is exposing them to huge tax liability. And, doing it wrong can cause you to actually zero out your account AND owe a ton of money next year.  So, here’s a crash course on how to do this. The year is almost over, and you need to do this stuff NOW to be in good shape for your tax bill next year.  (NOTE - this is for US citizens and US residents. If you are elsewhere, other rules apply. Before you cackle at us Europeans, some of you have wealth taxes which are even worse). As for Singaporeans, your tax system is awesome, la.

Anyway...

**The basics:**

Taxes are incurred in a few ways. First, whenever you SELL a capital asset(a stock, option, other securities, whatever) or close a short trade, you realize a gain or loss that is a taxable event. Secondly, when you hold 1256 contracts at year end you get marked to market (oil futures, NDX, SPX, etc). You usually wont have these. And lastly when you receive dividends, which no one on this sub ever has.

Of course, you only get taxed on gains… offset by losses that you made in the past or the SAME YEAR. The big danger with a year like this is you have massive gains that you’ve realized… which means you’ll owe massive taxes. If you trade with that money and lose it next year, you’ll not be able to mark those against your gains, and you could hypothetically zero out your account with a dumb trade next year, AND owe a ton of taxes. Also note that if you are at a net loss, you don’t owe tax, and the residual losses carry forward to protect you from taxes on the same amount of some future gain. I believe you apply STCG to STCL first, but in the absence of that, you can use LTCL. Same for LTCG vs LTCL, THEN STCL.

These taxes are generally due the following year (unless you made a ton, more on that later), and will generally be your top income tax rate plus a little (ACA surcharge of a few %), unless you have LTCG (unlikely on this forum), or have a lot of losses to offset (likely on this forum).

Lastly, each position has ‘tax lots’ which are the individual times you entered the position. If you sell less than the full position, most brokerages will try to sell whatever will cause you the least taxes, which means, it will sell to make losses first, small gains next, large gains last.

**Random Tips and Things To Know:**

*Doom Scenario* – If you take away one thing here – if you made big gains, realize losses to zero them out, and on anything leftover, SET ASIDE THE MONEY - MAYBE 40% OF THE GAIN TO BE SAFE. You’ll owe this tax on gains EVEN IF you zero out your account on January 2nd. Don’t put yourself in that position.  I talk about this in detail here:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jqewaw/psa\_dont\_forget\_to\_lose\_all\_of\_your\_gains\_before/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jqewaw/psa_dont_forget_to_lose_all_of_your_gains_before/)

*Loss Harvesting* – A common year end strategy is to dump your losers BEFORE the end of the year so you can put them against your gains. If you have some old now worthless options sitting around that wont expire until next year, there’s big benefit to selling these off if you have gains.  TLDR – realize your losses, probably now or really soon. Beware wash sale though…

*Wash Sales* – If you sell something at a loss, and rebuy the exact same thing within 31 days, the realize is cancelled out, and the loss is added back into the cost basis of the stock. You still can get this loss, you just don’t get to call it a realized loss and offset gains with it until sold for 31 days without a rebuy. In theory, this MAY apply to call options on the same ticker… but it’s a grey area, and the IRS has not given clear guidance on this for decades despite this being a known issue. Proceed with caution here. It is agreed that if you use the EXACT SAME option, wash sale 100% applied. For different options on same ticker, it’s grey and not agreed upon by CPAs (conservative rule is – assume it’s a wash sale).

*Splitting gains over tax years* – If you have phat gains now, hedging a bit and realizing some now, some early January may be prudent so you can spread the income over lower tax brackets. Easy strategy to do.

*Holding for LTCG* – In theory, if you hold an option or stock more than a year, it becomes LTCG rate which is lower. But who does that here? Hedging these gains with put options is considered kosher with the IRS.   So, if your SHOP you got in March is up 1000% and you want to sell now, you could just buy puts into March to protect, then realize then, and pay fewer taxes via long term capital gains rate... and grab a small short term loss on those options if price didn’t go down. In general, LTCG are better to have than STCG.

*IRAs and 401ks -* IRAs are awesome. Roth is generally better especially if young. I'm not going do a bunch of writing about this, but you certainly can reduce your taxes by putting money into a deductible IRA. The problem with this is you then can't roll it over to your roth since you made a deductible contribution. Once in the IRA, obviously you can do all sorts of crazy stuff to drive returns and not pay tax.

*Income Offset* – You can writeoff $3k of losses against your primary income every year for free, no questions asked. But it does eat into your loss reserve.

*Tax Exempt Accounts -* If you are a true WSB Autist and are doing daily/weekly options inside your IRA, yes, all tax considerations there are irrelevant. Also, that's really stupid, don't do that. Unless you are already up 5000%, in which case, please stop now.

*Mutual Funds -* Not a WSB thing, but mutual funds, as opposed to etfs, do special dividends that are distributions of STCG and LTCG. These are taxable events for you. Look closely at their notices! This can be important in other accounts you hold that are not reckless day trading. Use day trading losses to offset these gains! (Assuming the mutual fund was in a taxable account, and your day trading account is also taxable). I'm not really a mutual fund expert so rely on my advice on this one even less.

*Estimated Quarterly Payments* – When you make lots and lots of money, you are expected to pay those income taxes before filing date in April. This varies by states, so check the rules if you are making A LOT (100k+ usually). For federal, you owe these up until the point where you have paid the full amount of federal tax you paid the previous year – amounts over this you aren’t on the hook to pre-pay. There are guides online for how to play a 1040-es and so forth. TLDR - make a lot of money, check your state rules, and make sure youve paid as much federal already or will have paid by end of year as you paid last year.

*Charitable Donations* – Charitable donations do reduce tax liability. Better is to DONATE SHARES to a donor advised fund, such as what Fidelity offers, then direct the DAF to give to the charity of your choice. Money in there can also appreciate over time, so you can day trade further, albeit with indexes only. The reason this is better than donating cash is you get the writeoff of the value of the shares, AND you don’t cause a capital gains realize – so no capital gains tax. I would not donate options – you can, but they’ll get marked to market in a somewhat unfavorable manner unless massively in the money, and even then, check before you do it!

*Broker Interest -* Interest you pay your broker with a negative cash balance is deducted against your gains. Interest your broker pays to you is just income. This seldom is a big impact.

*Commissions -* Because someone will ask, broker commissions are just added to your cost of shares, so they are effectively deductible and it happens automatically.

*Trader Status* – You can elect to be a trader every year at normal filing deadline. If you do, ALL of your gains/losses inside designated accounts become income instead of STCG. This is desirable because losses can then go against your income, and you also don’t pay the ACA surcharge on investment income. You also can deduct more things against this. But, this has strict rules to do, and only applies if you are making dozens of trades a week, trading daily, and are really making a lot of money doing it. Note that this loses the ability to use 1256 taxation and ltcg in these accounts, so its sometimes just worse. The main advantage is in bad years you can put it against your Wendy’s w2.

*1256 Contracts* – These are special contracts that give you 60% LTCG and 40% LTCG regardless of the hold. XSP, SPX, NDX and RUT options do this, as do most futures contracts. They also are wash sale immune, and are grown up trader hacks. I have a long ass post about this all here, but the TLDR is that for non-long-term holds with significant amounts of money, you really should be using these instead of SPY, QQQ and IWM.  Here’s my post about that:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gq4e0l/taxes\_and\_spy\_vs\_spx\_iwm\_vs\_rut\_qqq\_vs\_ndx\_please/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gq4e0l/taxes_and_spy_vs_spx_iwm_vs_rut_qqq_vs_ndx_please/)

*GLD and SLV* – These are collectibles rate. Even worse taxes on long term than normal LTCG. FYI. Here’s a treatise on why you should use other vehicles than these:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hytk5e/stop\_overpaying\_taxes\_on\_gld\_options/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hytk5e/stop_overpaying_taxes_on_gld_options/)

*Constructive Sale* \-  If you have a long position that has made a lot, but is unrealized, and you do some crazy option trade to basically sell it (such as selling calls that are massive in the money), the IRS may decide this is a constructive sale and call it a realize. Don’t get too clever on this stuff. It usually doesn’t come up, but if the tax bill is large enough, it may.

*QOZ:* Special tax rules for ultra rich traders with good resources, like that guy who made $5m day trading PLTR. If you made hundreds of thousands of dollars in gains, and have net worth over a few million bucks (qualified investor comfortably), you could enroll in a QOZ. This allows you to defer payment of tax on designated gains for 6 or 7 years, get a 10% discount on the amount owed, AND the investment you make is tax free on gains AND can still do return of capital with a cash-out refi (usually real estate). Getting good QOZs is hard, they aren’t easily accessible, and you’ll likely want to use a family office, a rich friend, or a wealth manager if you go this route. This truly is a bonanza, but it’s hard to access. You have 6 months from when you realized a gain to use this. K-1s and 1256s count as dec 31 of that year realize.

*Hedge Funds:* These are generally awful, unless you are either a non-profit, or unless they are some really interesting specialized thing that you won't have access to and has trader status and generates mad returns always. In other words, great if you are an employee of Renaissance, bad otherwise. I'm exaggerating a little bit, but hedge funds that generate a k-1 got a lot worse with tax reforms.

*Dividends:* Least likely for this community, so last on the list. If you get a dividend from a normal stock or stock etf, it's generally a standard dividend. That's income if you've held the etf/stock less than 30 days, and LTCG tax rate (but I don’t think a ltcg) effectively otherwise. For preferred shares, this clock is 90 days. For etfs that are bonds, and bonds directly, and mutual funds with bonds, it's just interest income, so income. On rare occasions, dividends are return of capital (not taxable), municipal bond income (not taxable), LTCG distributions (taxable) and STCG distributions (also taxable).

&#x200B;

**DISCLAIMER -** Making mistakes on taxes can be costly. There are edge case risks that are significant. While trading normal options and etfs and just plugging your 1099 and w2 into turbotax or similar will generally work, more esoteric stuff has more problems, and you also can get too clever. And, mis-understanding stuff can get you in trouble too. While I hope that this guide is generally helpful in educating you on basic tax strategy, you really should self study, and ultimately rely upon your own judgement or that of an adviser in making decisions. For it to be appropriate advice for you, someone (you or an adviser) needs the full picture and all the details. My post is not customized to you, I can't know those things.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Summary:** CD Projekt’s current stock valuation does not reflect the transformative effect of *Cyberpunk 2077* which will be released on Dec 10, 2020. RED engine 4 will be an asset that will provide a unique game development ability to the company in the future. Delays and uncertainty around the launch of *Cyberpunk 2077* in addition to sparse analyst coverage of the company have resulted in suppressed stock price and present a great risk vs reward ratio for investors.

# Introduction

CD Projekt SA ($OTGLY) is a polish company that with its subsidiaries develops and publishes videogames in addition to owning GOG.com platform. The firm derives most of its revenues from CD Projekt Red segment, which is best known for *The Witcher* series. *Cyberpunk 2077* is the latest and the most ambitious project by the company. We expect the video game market to grow in coming years, reflecting the continuing popularity of interactive entertainment. The demographics of the gaming industry have broadened significantly in recent years, with video games becoming an increasingly popular form of mainstream entertainment. Average gamer is 35 years old North American male with increasing disposable income. In response to gamers becoming more hardcore enthusiast, CD Projekt Red has dedicated significant resources to develop and publish high-quality interactive role-playing games that appeal to hardcore gamers.

# Shares

CD Projekt SA trades on Warsaw Stock Exchange which is denominated in Polish złoty. Only recently $OTGLY American Depositary Receipt which represent ¼ of a CD.R share has been available to OTC investors in North America. Since most investment firms avoid investing in assets not denominated in USD, the coverage of CD Projekt SA is sparse, and shares are undersubscribed. European investors that prefer investing using Euro may invest 7CD, which is traded in Frankfurt stock exchange. The company currently has a market capitalization of 9.5 Billion USD. It has 15X its market cap in the past 5 years due to success of *The Witcher* series. The board owns 1/3 of the shares and 2/3 is floated on stock markets. The two founders own 24% of the company.

# CD Projekt Red Game Development

CD Projekt Red invests significant resources in games that it develops. It does not divide its resources trying to make and maintain multiple projects. Their 121-million-dollar investment in development of *Cyberpunk 2077* is reflective of that philosophy. *Cyberpunk 2077* was announced in May 2012 and in January 2013 a teaser trailer was released.

Their in house developed RED engine 4 with Ray Tracing Technology is a great asset which will benefit future iterations of *Cyberpunk* and *The Witcher* series. This is also beneficial to the company since it does not have to license its game development engine from third party companies.

Delays and release problems are common themes for CD Projekt Red and its founders (Marcin Iwiński and Michał Kiciński). At no point in time were they able to release a major game without any delays or even with just minor delays. They even took the company to the brink of bankruptcy about a decade ago due to mismanagement of game development. *Cyberpunk 2077* release has not been any different and has been fraught with delays. Initial release of April 16th, 2020 was first delayed to Sept 17, then to Nov 19th and finally to Dec 10th. The last delay was after the company mentioned that the game has gone “gold”, which means the code is finalized. The delays were unfortunate since they have resulted in loss of sales during the time that video game industry benefited from school closures and stay at home gaming due to Covid-19 shelter in place orders. Furthermore, the delay from Nov 19th will cause some shoppers to choose alternative games as thanksgiving gifts. However, we believe that gamers will flock to this game due to uniqueness of its content, depth of game development, ray tracing technology, and a multifaceted storyline.

# Cyberpunk 2077:

The hype around *Cyberpunk 2077* is unlike any other game. Any material posted on social media instantly receives millions of views. Official trailers have amassed 50 million views online. Any post on social media receives more engagement than Red Dead Redemption II and Call of Duty Black Ops Cold War. CD Projekt Red has a fantastic track record for pleasing gamers. CD Projekt Red’s high level of craftsmanship of *The Witcher 3*, and promising gameplay reviews and demos have resulted in spectacular levels of excitement among fans. *Cyberpunk 2077* was the winner of Best PS Game, Best PC Game, Best RPG Game, and Most Wanted Game in 2020 Gamescom.

The fact that *Cyberpunk 2077* is compatible with eight generation consoles (PS4, Xbox One) in addition to ninth generation consoles increases its addressable market significantly. Gamers who do not want to upgrade to ninth generation consoles will have limited options in future; one of which will be *Cyberpunk*. This creates a significant and often overlooked advantage for *Cyberpunk 2077*.

*Cyberpunk 2077* has great voice actors. Keanu Reeves getting most of the attention as Johnny Silverhand. Recruiting of Keanu Reeves was an excellent decision given his roles as in \*The Matrix (\*A cyberpunk genre movie), and *John Wick (An action-thriller).* There is also the following: Michael-Leon Wooley as Dexter "Dex" DeShawn. Grimes as Lizzy Wizzy. Samuel Barnett as Delamain A.I. Jason Hightower as Jackie Welles. Mark Holden as Doctor Paradox/Various Others. Cherami Leigh, Gavin Drea, Lidia Sadowa, Kamil Kula as Main Character/Protagonist "V".

Cyberpunk genre has a devout following. It is largely considered a subgenre of science fiction in a dystopian future. It has been proven engaging and attractive to mostly male target audience. It’s focus on high-tech lowlifes dealing with breakdown of societal order could not be any more relevant than these days. *Cyberpunk 2077* taps into fantasy of advanced technological and scientific achievements, such as artificial intelligence and cybernetics, juxtaposed with breakdown and radical change in the social order.

We anticipate *Cyberpunk 2077* to have record-breaking sales. Our predictions are more optimistic than that of others; however, we believe it is reflective of the game quality and current condition of gaming industry. The conservative version of our estimations can be found in the following chart:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/y4bhwh77vf261.png?width=877&format=png&auto=webp&s=96fe1118a7acc8b9212ec57ebede039e89b2d7f6

The figures for second year will depend largely on success of *Cyberpunk: Edgerunners*, an anime spin-off being produced for Netflix. It is scheduled to premiere on Netflix in 2022. The figures above do not account for Collector’s editions sales since it is unclear if CD Projekt is able to produce and supply them in the needed quantities on time. Collector’s editions are marketed at $250.

We anticipate about 60% of *Cyberpunk 2077* buyers to be in North America and 30% in Europe. Hence, there is negligible currency risk. Collector’s edition will be a key driver of North American excess sales.

*Cyberpunk 2077* will offer no in game purchases. We view this with mixed feelings. Lack of loot boxes, subscriptions services or other major ancillary digital sources of revenue make the game feel authentic to gamers; which in turn results in increased sales. This revenue can be deferred to the MMORPG iteration of the franchise when released. The goodwill created by *Cyberpunk 2077* will not be reflected in bank accounts of the company yet but will lock in gamers into *Cyberpunk* series and create more enthusiasm for future release.

# Discounting for risk:

When compared to other mega launches and our expectations of sales, *Cyberpunk 2077* pre-orders are 40% behind. We attribute this to the perpetual delays and lack of preceding games in this title. Gamers are completely disillusioned by perpetual delays. Founders’ lack of transparency about game development and dishonesty about game “going gold” are of concern for investors. Management appears to be tone deaf to gamers and share holders’ expectations. In 2018 CEO blatantly refused to answer questions about development costs of *Thronebreakers: The Witcher Tales*. These issues cannot be resolved due to management’s hostility to mergers or being acquired by other firms. EA’s effort to buy the firm were rebuffed in the past. The management fails to understand that as a publicly traded company they have to work in the best interest of shareholder. As mentioned earlier, one third of the shares are owned by the board members.

Developing melee combat in a first-person perspective is difficult. \*Cyberpunk 2077’\*s mechanics may fall short of high expectations. This was a minor issue that plagued *The Witcher* series.

Our risk assessment includes our concerns regarding delays, technical difficulties, the unpredictability of video game sales, and an inherently hit-driven business model. With its smaller portfolio of games vs. other studios, we see CD Projekt carrying higher risk than its North American rivals. Due to these factors, we believe a 30% risk premium is justified.

# CD Projekt Operations:

· **Brands:** *The Witcher, Cyberpunk*, and GOG.com all are quality brands that ensure high margin operations.

· **Technology:** REDengine allowing unique development of open-world RPGs with Ray tracing.

· **Gamer goodwill:** The goodwill created by removing Digital Rights Management in *The Witcher* series and GOG games the team has generated the highest amount of goodwill in the gamer community (at times to the detriment of profits).

· **Distribution:** GOG and direct distribution of games

· **Development team:** Capable and experienced team of developers who are passionate about their games

I would like to make you all aware of a company that was purchased in 2017 and subsequently IPO'd by some PEBs (Private Equity Barons) back in August 2020. You see, these guys take being a true autist to the next level. Simply put, these guys go to the bank with 22-year-old models on a fucking leash just for shits. These guys buy horse semen for $5k/vial in hopes of breeding the next Zenyatta. These guys have been around the block and they will squeeze every last drop of profit out of anything with EBITDA. 

Corsair ($CRSR) is going to Pluto thanks to these horsecock-slinging PEBs. They bought the company for \~$525M in 2017 and never looked back. After some timely payroll cuts and ensuring the company has been properly levered up, they took this baby to NASDAQ and demanded no less than $1.5B. 

These guys are out for blood. They will not be satisfied with a mere $3.5B valuation. Absolutely not. These guys won't settle for anything less than 10x. We still have \~$2B to go, at a minimum. 

So get your saddles ready, because these horse semen trading PEBs will not stop until this stock is at $69/share. Only then can they purchase the coveted G650ER with matching dog leashes.

Cruise lines,
Airline companies

That family favorite Dave and busters you would always go to after making some sweet sweet tendy gains.

This should be obvious but A lot of these companies will most likely bounce back. And you would more than double your money or quadruple in some cases if they do. Unless they go out of business of course. 

The thing is people will always want to go to movie theaters for the social experience, there not going to disappear anytime soon and the studios aren’t going to stop making the fast and furious or John wick movies.

Yeah stuff like Netflix & Hulu are booming right now but what happens when things start stabilizing and kids start going back to school and spending less time on those apps, when people start returning to work, that would be a great opportunity to short those stocks because they might not stay up as high as they are right now.

People are always going to want to take their family on a trip to the Bahamas on a Cruise line to meet some women in bikinis, eat shrimp, drink and watch an adult dressed in a mouse costume to take photos of for fond memories.

People are always going to fly not stopping anytime soon, however right now most people don’t want to get in a pressurized tin can at 40,000 feet in the air but that won’t stop people once this settles down.

The take away from this is do some research on what was up about a year ago, if you can make a long term investment and wait until things settle you will more than likely double your gains (if the company doesn’t go completely out of business that is) this next year or when things return to normal._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ This past week, PLTR does well when you Autist hold more than the baby ass “high” _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ DMYD : Own the Big Data Provider that Powers DraftKings and Fanduel [UK's Genius Sports bets on NY-listed SPAC to go public in $1.5 billion deal](https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-genius-sports-group-m-a-dmy-technolog/uks-genius-sports-bets-on-ny-listed-spac-to-go-public-in-1-5-billion-deal-idUKKBN27C0TE)

[Investor Presentation](https://news.geniussports.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/GSG-Investor-Presentation.pdf)

TLDR at bottom

We've seen a huge shift in momentum for SPACs lately with pretty much every SPAC from fraudulent to zero revenue mooning to a pretty high entry point. Do you know what genuine company has been under the radar and stayed relatively unknown? Genius Sports.

Genius Sports (Ticker: DMYD) basically captures and provides sports stats, data and technology that powers sports betting platforms, such as DraftKings, Fanduel, etc. on behalf of professional leagues

* Some things to note:
   * With the advent of in-sports real-time betting, the market is exploding at over **25%** annually
   * More states are legalizing sports betting, serving as a major growth catalyst: Genius customers are seeing **2-3x revenue growth** in 2020
   * Sports leagues are coming back in fully in 2021 with COVID vaccination just on the horizon
   * This is a **duopoly market with high barriers of entry**, the other main rival being Sportsradar (remember the FEAC hype?)
* Genius has a clear **economic moat** built around:
   * Proprietary technology to track and record in-game statistics on behalf of major sports leagues, in exchange for data rights
   * **7,000+ statisticians and agents** on the ground, **managing 240K+ events per year**
   * Highly customizable software that manages every aspect of a sportsbook’s data and trading offering, including advertising and streaming services
   * Significant opportunity for inorganic growth via M&A
   * Highly fragmented market for technology, content and media within sports ripe for consolidation to boost growth outside of plan

# Partnerships

Their technology has proved to be incredibly well made with long term contracts with some big dogs you'll recognize:

Basketball: NBA, NCAA, March Madness

Soccer: FIFA, Premier League, Serie A, Bundesliga

Golf: PGA, LPGA, European Tour

Racing: NASCAR

Online Sportsbooks: DraftKings & Fanduel

Traditional Sportsbooks: MGM, Caesars, SkyBet, William Hill

# Financials

* Already makes **$140M+** in revenue AND is **profitable**, with **$14M in 2020 EBITDA**
* Growing at **30% CAGR**, with $230M revenue and $68M EBITDA by 2022
* **$500M+** **EBITDA** **potential** in the horizon
* Customer contracts have **guaranteed minimums** with upside on usage. The majority of 2020 revenue is **locked in** **for 3-4 years** on average
* Only ever lost one customer in the past three years

# Trading dynamics

* Deal was overlooked because it was announced just before the election (10/27/20), one of the worst trading weeks for the entire market
* Reddit following has been limited and Stocktwits nonexistent
* Average volume of 501.66K with a LOI signed.

If Genius Sports were to trade at similar 2022E revenue multiple of 19x as Draftkings, it would imply a stock price of **$24-25**

***TLDR: Long DMYD shares because it’s a huge sleeper pick. These guys run the sports betting industry behind the scenes & make a ton of money in a fast-growing market. Basically they’re the guys who sold shovels and jeans to the miners during the Gold Rush.***_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Sell Moderna (MRNA) after first vaccines are delivered Moderna and Pfizer/BNTX have both filed for EUA and are the leading candidates to deliver a vaccine first.

Moderna has said they'd delivery 20m units in 2020 (skeptical, given there's only one month left for EUA and then delivery). If they do, they're able to sell 20m x $15.55/unit = $311m in revenue in 2020.

If Pfizer delivers their 50m units in 2020 (also skeptical) they sell 50m x $19.50/unit = $975m revenue. 

In 2021, let's estimate that the addressable market for US vaccines is about 250m or 76% of the total population. (this is only for vaccines received via the US Government contracts, excluding private insurance, etc.) If MRNA can deliver 40m a month and PFE can do 45m a month, then we'd reach 76% vaccination by May 2021 from US vaccines alone.

MRNA will likely deliver total \~220m doses to US for \~$3.5billion revenue (100m doses @ $15.55, 150m doses @ $16.50). PFE will deliver total \~ 280m doses to US for \~$5.5 billion revenue (280m @ $19.50).

The real money-maker for MRNA's COVID vaccine deal comes from private/international deals. MRNA has said that they're able to sell their doses at up to $37 a dose. Let's just say MRNA is somehow able to get off 100m doses to private/international deals $37 a dose. MRNA's revenue would be \~$3.7 billion, bringing total 2021 revenue to be \~$7.6 billion. 

However, all of this is assuming that Moderna and Pfizer have a serious head-start over all vaccine makers out there. It appears that the mRNA methods of vaccination are the most costly. AstraZeneca has said that their vaccine would be available at $4 a dose (compare this to $20-40 for a mRNA course). Neither Moderna nor Pfizer has released details on cost to manufacture, but I can't imagine that either would still be profitable if the vaccine market price fell to $4/dose. 

Thus the maximum revenue for Moderna from all COVID is probably $7.6 billion total. This is factoring in that MRNA and PFE have a very, very generous lead over other vaccines and are able to essentially vaccinate the entire US before anyone else does. Moderna's market cap seems quite over-valued at \~$60billion, given that they are likely to generate max $7.6 billion in revenue (who knows what their profit margins are). 

Short term, I believe Moderna's likely to continue rising until it gets EUA and makes its first shipments. I would sell after. 

**TL:DR**: Sell Moderna (MRNA) after EUA is granted and first shipments are made._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ CHWY - THE DOGO VERSION OF GME REPORTS EARNINGS NEXT WEEK- $85K POSITION 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ After NVAX May Play.

Tl;dr: Invest a little in several promising stocks and sectors, and hold through the dips. 

Just posting this since I can’t go back in time to tell myself, but maybe my experiences will help out some other noobs who only have time to trade as a side-hustle. I really have no idea of what I’m doing, so take this post with a grain of salt... However, if you see something wrong with my strategy, feel free to tear it apart! 

I’ve traded off and on since May with okay results—40% gains overall. However, my account dipped below $25k this morning so I couldn’t sell my FOMO shares without being marked as a pattern day trader, so I’ve just been watching my account go down further and further...and then start to go back up... I was down about $1000 and as of now I’m back in the green +$400 or so... 

A blessing in disguise? Maybe. Given that I couldn’t sell when I wanted to, I was forced to hold and I’m glad I did. This led me to evaluate some of the stocks I bought back in July that made a decent profit, dipped triggering me to panic sell after losing most of the gains, only to buy back in later at a higher price. Interestingly, if I would have held these stocks through the dips, my profits would have been well over the measly 40%—im talking 300% or more. 

For example, if I would have held onto the 4 TSLA shares I bought for $995 (pre-split), I’d have 20 shares now worth about 4x what I paid. Similar story with PLUG, BLNK, LAC, APHA and FCEL. My initial investment of $25k*would be worth over $100k had I forgot I invested, and it would have saved countless hours of stress and anxiety. *note: it’s under $25k now because I’ve been using profits to remodel my house. 

That said, I’m going to try this hold and see approach starting tomorrow. Tomorrow I’ll clear out my FOMO stocks and maintain a dozen or so promising positions that I believe are set to boom over the next year or so—primarily anything having to do with EV, renewable energy and marijuana. Limiting myself to just ~$2k initial investments in each stock should limit the risk (unless everything tanks long term, which I think is unlikely). I’ll then try to only check my account every two weeks. Not as sexy as day trading, but it might make sense for folks like me who work fulltime. 

So far I’m thinking:
[TSLA, duh]
[LAC, up and coming lithium mine near Tesla’s NV battery factory]
[PLUG, charging stations]
[BLNK, charging stations]
[FCEL, alternative energy]
[HEXO, marijuana]
[APHA, marijuana]
[NOVA, solar]
[RUN, solar]
[And a variety of ARK_ ETFs. ]

Any thoughts?? Am I missing anything? Any of these seem like a bad bet? 

Wish me luck!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $SFM Opportunity Is Sprouting At Sprouts Farmers Market There’s no doubt grocery stores benefited from COVID-19 and the resulting changes in consumer behavior.

With future expansion plans, a strong brand, and a competitive position in a niche market, investors would be mistaken to move away from this growing grocer.

Despite the growth tailwinds and leading profitability, SFM now trades at a price equal to its three-year average economic book value.

This stock offers excellent risk/reward based on:

-Strong growth opportunities for same stores and new stores

-Sharp focus on its target customers and expanding margins

-Successful execution of its e-commerce strategy

-"Fresh, healthy, and natural” offering that conventional grocers struggle to replicate
Stock trading as if profits will permanently decline by 20% from TTM levels

Healthy Eating Tailwinds Will Push Sales Higher:

While the boost in grocery sales due to COVID-19 may not last forever, consumers’ eating habits are moving toward fresher, healthier, and more natural foods over the long term. 

Global market research firm Technavio expects the global health and wellness food market to grow by 6% compounded annually from 2020 to 2024. Additionally, the global organic foods market is projected to grow nearly 11% compounded annually from 2019 to 2025.

The rise in popularity of health and organic foods is a long-term tailwind for Sprouts growth.

E-Commerce Sprouts Profit Growth Too:

Before the pandemic, online grocery sales accounted for 4.3% of total U.S. grocery sales. During the pandemic, the share of online grocery sales has increased to 10%. While Walmart (WMT) and Amazon (AMZ) are the online grocery share leaders, Sprouts is doing more than holding its own. 

The firm’s 3Q20 e-commerce sales increased 337% YoY and now comprise of 11% of the firm’s total sales.

In addition to providing curbside and delivery service from orders made through its app and website, Sprouts used the pandemic as an opportunity to accelerate its plan to shift from print ads to digital ads. Digital ads help the firm reach more customers in a more targeted fashion than it can with print flyers. In 3Q20, Sprouts’ weekly digital ads generated 70 million confirmed views compared to the 21 million printed flyers it was previously distributing on a weekly basis. The shorter lead time required for creating digital ads also means the firm can be more dynamic in packaging offers and build more profitable promotions. More effective advertising helps Sprouts promote its differentiated value proposition, be more profitable, and grow faster._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Will NIO stay above 49.00 til Friday or am I out 20k? _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $AAPL updated position took $20k profits on recent positions and re entered with less still riding it _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ November FBI Background Checks Due out Soon.

The key to interpreting future movements is looking at the fintech industry as a whole. By far the largest company within this sector is PayPal (PYPL). PayPal’s market cap is ~2.7 times the size of Square’s, yet offers less services. The only reason PayPal is larger than Square is because of its earlier IPO and subsequent market relevancy. Square has been expanding its brand by buying up smaller financial service companies, like Cashapp and Credit Karma. Cash app’s current user base is about 1/12 the size of PayPal’s, but I think growth is in order with the shifting age demographics of fintech’s user base. PayPal is the Facebook of online payment apps, while Square is the Twitter (owned by the same guy too). I believe that Square’s market cap will surpass 250 billion within a year’s time, and take PayPal’s throne at the top of the industry.

Edit: Up 20% since posting_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ FTCH strong financials to the moon 🚀 FarFetch (FTCH)
Farfetch Limited, through its subsidiary, Farfetch.com Limited, provides an online marketplace for luxury goods in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and the Asia Pacific.

It operates Farfetch.com, a Website and mobile app for luxury goods; and offers Farfetch Black & White, a white-label business to business e-commerce solution with front-end suite of products comprising Websites and apps for retailers and brands.

The company takes a 25% commission per sale from its boutique partners and an additional fee of up to 8% if it handles the fulfillment and shipping.

That also means it carries virtually no inventory risk since it does not own the products.

The company does have an accelerated China strategy which is a monstrous opportunity not just due to the size of the Chinese market, but in particular with China’s GDP back to growth as COVID has nearly drifted away.

The Chinese luxury market, in and of itself, will stand at $170 billion according to FarFetch, by 2025.

FTCH previously killed earnings a few weeks ago and is projected to hit one billion in revenue in February on their earnings. This is due to an increase of 40% of clothes sales during the pandemic and Christmas times.

The company beat revenue and earnings estimates and has guided to profitability for next quarter well ahead of schedule.

The company accelerated GMV growth to 60% in third quarter 2020 driven by acceleration across all three geographic regions – the Americas, EMEA and APAC, including each of its top 5 countries, which grew faster than during second quarter 2020.

The company has announced a global partnership with Alibaba and Richemont to accelerate the digitization of luxury industry.

The strategic partners will invest a total of $1.15 billion in Farfetch Limited and the new Farfetch China joint venture.

The new China joint venture to be formed to operate the Farfetch marketplace in China is to be 75% owned by Farfetch, with the remaining 25% owned equally by Alibaba and Richemont.

These are all enormous numbers.

Even further, the company launched a new iOS and Android app in China, providing a more localized experience for shoppers.

* Revenue: $438 million, up 71% year-over-year, versus analyst expectations of $366.94 million.
This is a big beat.

* Adjusted EPS: -$0.17 versus analyst expectations of -$0.30.
This is a beat.

* Next Quarter Adj EPS Guidance: “Positive adjusted EBIDTA” versus analyst expectations of -$0.27
This was a big raise.

Thematics
The worldwide retail luxury market is enormous.

Revenue from luxury goods was $213 billion in 2012 and is forecast to reach $388 billion by 2025.

In the chart below from Statista, we can see the remarkable trend, even when accounting for the impact of COVID-19 in 2020.

FTCH $65 call 4/21/21_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $QS DD—Get your short shorts boys. The tendie train of the day is QuantomScape ($**QS**)... 

# The following is my take on why I think $QS is grossly overvalued and this speculation spike we've had in the last week is destined to fall just as hard as it mooned.

*If you pull up a chart, you'll see that $QS had a massive (speculation) run in the last week after their SPAC deal with Kensington Capital.* 

**Who is QuantomScape/what do they do?**

They are an EV Battery company—they have a super innovative battery that sets them apart from the Lithium-ion world, with their **Solid-State Lithium-Metal technology**. You can watch a product video [here](https://vimeo.com/466298136).

&#x200B;

[Superior Energy Density](https://preview.redd.it/1x589ko1le261.png?width=2568&format=png&auto=webp&s=8184283e70cc169d423e6c33de420f7ce800128d)

[Even cheaper than Li-Ion.](https://preview.redd.it/dwklqfirle261.png?width=2564&format=png&auto=webp&s=e01445e55d6b155e5ab810e094b068d45a319d73)

[Here's a direct comparison of the two.](https://preview.redd.it/5ida58sime261.png?width=2546&format=png&auto=webp&s=1d5011f745fbc8f47f532d04780a2827b3693c56)

To sum it up, their technology is nothing to scoff at... their batteries have a higher energy density, provide more range, more compact than lithium-ion batteries, they're cheaper, etc. **They're better than the industry-leading Li-Ion batteries across the board.**

Also worth noting, QuantomScape is backed by JB Straubel (Tesla's Cofounder), and if you know Tesla's history, you know how substantial the backing by the likes of him is...

**The Financials:**

Before I dive into this, it's worth noting that their TAM is $450B, and their current MCAP is less than $1B... That number is derived from the fact that 90M cars are produced a year, multiplied by the price of their battery.

&#x200B;

[Sales Commitments](https://preview.redd.it/hpezchv1se261.png?width=2554&format=png&auto=webp&s=e55abb0aaea6a2f6cd6a4b57d31fc62cf455a072)

As you can see, they are partnered with Volkswagen, so their **estimated revenues are just about as guaranteed as an estimate gets**. Volkswagen plans to launch \~70 EV models, and produce 22M EV's by 2029 in which will be powered by QuantomScape. 

&#x200B;

[REV Estimates](https://preview.redd.it/eg1q9rblse261.png?width=2554&format=png&auto=webp&s=031d1ed6ac2900ab5ec78299b2c0c7f5784ed79c)

Here are their estimated revenues, and here lies the major problem for me... 

 **!! THEY DON'T HAVE ANY REVENUES UNTIL 2024 YET THEY'RE SELLING AT 72X EV/REVS !!**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/vvak1cr7ve261.png?width=2094&format=png&auto=webp&s=f372dfc22c81654f60df838e0802c3f295f80235

If this price isn't pure speculation, then idk what is... It's reminding me of $NKLA at $70. They haven't even proved they have the manufacturing capabilities to meet any of their sales targets:

&#x200B;

[Roadmap](https://preview.redd.it/5cclczznue261.png?width=2558&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f88e5f47c6698685d4702452afe1f4adca904f1)

Even if we lower the share price to $20, from the current trading price of $44 that would still be a 32x EV/REVS premium on projected revenues that are 4 years from now lol. 

**TLDR:**

\- Despite QuantomScape's incredible technology, the green grass is way too far out (4 years) to justify a 72x EV/REVS valuation. The current price is completed inflated by speculation.

\- QuantomScape hasn't even proved they can meet the manufacturing demands of their committed sales 4 years from now.

I think $QS is poised to be an incredible long-term investment considering its tech is unmatched, its TAM is enormous, and the entire EV space is growing like a wildfire; but simply not at this absurd valuation. I'm planning on riding my puts down to a reasonable valuation, then either buying leaps, or shares.

Take a break from PLTR and GME and listen up for the spiciest merger of 2021. Callaway (Boomer golf company, who previously owned 14% of Top Golf, is now planning to buy the entire company through a stock issuance. 

https://www.google.com/amp/s/golf.com/news/callaway-topgolf-ceos-explain-merger/amp/

Why does this matter? Bc golf absolutely thrived during the pandemic, and Top Golf is the fastest growing golf niche in America right now. Let me pull out some stats: Golfers played 20% more rounds of golf August 2020 vs 2019.

https://www.google.com/amp/s/golf.com/travel/golf-rounds-played-increase-2020-coronavirus/amp/

Additionally, Top Golf has experienced 30% yoy revenue growth each year since 2017. Top Golf is operating at similar capacity to pre-Covid thanks to the open bay environment, thus making it a reopening play that was never really punished.

This merger will weigh the company almost 50/50 between Callaway and Top Golf, with revenue streams projected to be around 50/50 too. However, this is a 1+1 = 3 scenario to me. 

Top Golf licenses its ball tracing technology to other driving ranges, a revenue stream that’s up 200%+ yoy. Also, Callaway can now market its gear through Top Golf, while exposing new players to its equipment. This is a merger that just flat out makes sense.

Alright guys, it’s your favorite Adderall munching retard back again with another stock DD (here is link to my last one [Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k0z2zy/an_in_depth_look_into_robloxrblx_and_why_i_am/). This time I’m going to look at another potential meme stock that is being COMPLETELY overlooked by WSB and why it has the extremely high probability of just exploding in value like Palantir come 2021. 

Now my analysis of CCL is broken down into 5 parts: Covid Vaccine, credit market sentiment, insider trades, pent-up demand, and the balance sheet. Since this post is pretty long, a TL;DR will be provided at the top of each section. 

  

**Covid Vaccine**

**TL;DR:** High probability of vaccine rollout in the US starting early to mid-2021. Once this news hit the market, investors will start pricing in a post covid world for travel companies and the stock could go back to ATHs as things go “back to normal.”

With the recent announcement of Moderna and Pfizer vaccines having a 95% efficacy rate, we are starting to see a massive shift into cyclical stocks and some capital outflow away from WFH stocks like Zoom. Although I am still long-term bullish on these tech stocks, I still believe that this flow into cyclicals still have a LONG WAY to go before it is exhausted. The reason why I am saying this is because travel stocks like CCL, AAL, etc are still trading more closely to their March lows than their ATHs pre pandemic. This is our opportunity because I believe the reason why travel stocks haven’t yet recovered to their ATHs like tech is that even though a vaccine is priced in, the rollout of it has yet to be. Right now there is no solid set date but I think that a 2021 rollout of vaccines in the U.S has a very high probability. The reason why I say this is because the US will be the first country to rollout its vaccine ([vaccine date](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2020/11/28/america-will-be-the-first-country-to-roll-out-a-covid-19-vaccine)) and in Canada where I live, our government already said that the Pfizer vaccine will receive the green light this year and we can start receiving the first shipments of it early next year ([Rollout Timeline](https://globalnews.ca/news/7489967/coronavirus-vaccine-available-canada/)). Once these dates become more set in stone, I believe the market will start pricing in a world post covid and this could be the catalyst to boost travel and tourism back to their ATHs and maybe even higher. Right now, I think one of the main reason why a lot of investors are hesitant to invest in CCL is because of the winter months and they want to see how it all rolls out, but remember, stocks are forward-looking and once vaccines are being rolled out, don’t be surprised if this final barrier of price resistance is broken and investors start rushing in. 

&#x200B;

  **Credit Market Sentiment**  

**TL;DR:** Bond traders are extremely bullish on this company meaning that the fundamentals are still rock solid despite the no sail order. Because of this stock is extremely oversold and is trading well below what its justified based on core fundamentals. 

Since most of you probably don’t know this, CCL did two major debt offerings during the pandemic, and boy oh boy did the investors gobble up every dollar. 

CCL did their first debt offering back in April 1 by issuing out $4bil in debt that paid 11.5% coupon. Demand was so great for the bond that of the $4bil offered, $17bil was used to bid up the price. It was so frenzied that Carnival decided to issue out an extra billion AND cut its coupon rate, something that was unheard of in an investment grade company ([Debt Issuance](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-01/record-752-billion-of-bond-sales-shows-rush-for-cash-buffers)). 

Yeah you read that right. When the stock of the company is cratering down into the 9 levels of hell, bond investors remain extremely bullish on the company. This might seem confusing to some of you but keep in mind that credit investors look at different factors than equity investors. In the credit market, transactions are still done dealer to dealer and investors are mostly concerned with whether or not a company is able to pay back its debt with its future earnings buy focusing on the fundamentals. Because of this, credit markets are often a good indication on a company’s fundamental value and where the economy is likely to head in the near future. Judging by the high demand for the company’s debt it would appear that despite having a no sail order, the fundamentals of the company remain relatively intact and the stock is most likely extremely oversold back in March. 

CCL’s second offering was a couple of weeks ago in November and guess what, investors gobbled up that shit to. This time the company issued $2bil worth of debt and unlike last time, the company won’t pledge collateral. The demand for CCL’s bonds are so high right now that the debt they issued in April at just under 12% is now trading at a significant premium and yielding only 5%. This means whoever bought their debt back in April can now turn around and sell those bonds back to market at a massive gain because with bonds, the interest rate goes down, price go up. 

To sum this part up, it would appear that the credit market is extremely bullish on the long-term prospects of this company. Since the credit market is more focused on the fundamentals, it would appear that the sell off back in March was extremely over done for the company and the stocks are most likely trading at a heavy discount. 

&#x200B;

**Insider Trades**

**TL;DR:** Company insiders are eating up shares like a fat kid does cookies. I have never seen such rampant insider buying before. Get in retards. 

📷Paying attention to what the company’s executives and BoD are doing are a pretty good way of seeing where the company is likely to go in the near future. So I went on Quiver Quantitative and gentlemen, what I found was truly shocking. Here is a snapshot. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/imb2fskxte261.png?width=1611&format=png&auto=webp&s=9356324fcb6128da8ba67e6e9528c27358e71370

What you are seeing there is a ratio of almost 21:1 for shares bought to sold. This is probably the highest ratio I have ever seen for any stock, ever. What this means is that company insiders are extremely bullish on this company and if they are willing to put this much money where their mouth is, you should probably to. 

&#x200B;

**Society’s View On Cruises**

**TL;DR:** People that go on cruises could not give two shits about the coronavirus. There is an extremely high pent-up demand for cruises to resume as shown by the 100,000 volunteers that showed up for a trial cruise by Royal Caribbean.  

I’m going to keep this part simple. People don’t care about the virus as much as the media likes to put them out to be. Right now there is SERIOUS pent-up demand for cruises to be back at full steam again. A good example of this is that recently Royal Caribbean wanted to arrange trial cruises in order to convince regulators that it can run successful Covid-free trips. Guess how many volunteers the company could find? 100? 1,000? Well, if you guessed 100,000 you are correct ([Link](https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/royal-caribbean-cdc-trial-cruises-covid/index.html)). 

The company is completely blown away by this and it really shows how much pent up demand there is for cruises. 

As an icing on the cake, here is a link for a Joe Rogan clip in which he discusses cruises with guest Tim Dillon: [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmSpQq60-Ls&ab_channel=JREClips) 

This clip essentially explains what cruise people are really like and whether or not the industry is simply going to “go away.” Spoilers, it’s not. 

&#x200B;

**Balance Sheet**

**TL;DR:** Financial statements are rock solid. Total assets outweigh total liabilities by a long margin meaning company is extremely solvent. Current cash outflow suggests that the company has more than enough to outlast most of 2021 without having to raise capital. Lastly, company can also easily raise debt to handle any short term liquidity needs. 

The balance sheet is fucking solid. Total assets out-weigh total liabilities by 19.5bil which should put to rest any fears of solvency. Current assets are about 900million short of current liabilities but judging by the ease in which the company can raise cash, liquidity shouldn’t be an issue. 

&#x200B;

In addition I also looked at their operating cash flow and with 0 cruises, they have -4.6bil operating CF for 9 months ended. But considering their current cash balance of 8.1bil, they easily have enough cash to cover most of 2021 and that’s not even considering raising capital.

**The Play**

Play stocks or long term ITM or ATM calls. The idea is to profit off of the potential pop in price come 2021 when things most likely get back to normal when the vaccine rolls out. Do not buy far OTM or FDs for this play as anything can happen to the rollout causing a dip in price. If you are buying options go for options that expire preferably near year-end 2021. That way theta gang won’t eat you alive if vaccine rollout gets delayed._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Time to bail and take profits on China stocks? If this passes the House (already passed Senate), I'm wondering if this will fubar our stakes in NIO, Tencent, JD, etc. Or will this get drawn out over the next few years and work itself out?

Compare revenues in screenshot below between Cron, CGC and APHA.

APHA is mkt leader yet only trades at only 5x’s sales where as the others trade at 30-100X’s+ sales. If we traded at similar multiple that would move us to $35-40/share just to get to the low end of the range of peers. Keep in mind, screenshot below is before APHA acquired SweetWater Brewing TODAY, based in Atlanta (14th largest brewer in United States). That will add $66M revenues right out of the gate & $22M to our already positive EBITDA. We’ve had 5 consecutive quarters of EBITDA profitability and plan to be cash flow positive next quarter...no other large marijuana company can say the same. And now they’ll distribute SweetWater to Canada and the other 23 states not currently distributed. Growing the brewer’s presence significantly. Most importantly, they will be begin infusing the drinks with THC and CBD now as well and also creating Seltzer’s.

**TLDR:** 1000 APHA shares long.

Post after post of losers making huge returns. Everyone is getting rich but you. Boofuckinghoo. The smart investor realizes it’s all hype. Some of it works, most of it doesn’t. To be successful you need to be able to recognize the difference and to do that, you need time, knowledge and practice. 

Here are ten tips that can help you along the way. 

**Tip 1 - You don’t know shit**

You’re going to lose your money. Don’t get suckered by reading posts about guys who made 1000% return in 5 minutes. For every one guy that posts his massive gains, 100+ suckers have lost their money. The first lesson to realize is that it’s way easier to lose money in the market than to make money. 

**Tip 2 - Understand how money flows in the market**

Money moves from the idiots to the knowledgable, from the impatient to the patient. Any dummy can make money short term. But to make money long-term and truly grow a portfolio, you have to be armed with knowledge and a shit ton of patience. 

**Tip 3 - Play for the long term**

The most important rule you need to follow religiously is NEVER FUCKING LOSE MONEY. Print it big, tape it to your wall. Your top responsibility is protecting your capital. YOLO is a stupid play. 99% of you are going to bet at the wrong time with the wrong stock. Calm the fuck down and work on a long term strategy. You have decades dummy. 

**Tip 4 - Time is on your side, but not much else**

The market never stops. The machine just churns and churns. Rich to poor, poor to rich, it just keeps on turning and turning. There are ALWAYS opportunities. Another IPO. Another MEME turd. FOMO is for fools. Miss a run? Big fucking deal. There’s another one around the corner. You have plenty of time to learn, test, and grow your capital. 

**Tip 5 - Paper Trading**

Paper trading is a simulation. It behaves exactly like a real account with real active data but it’s all practice. No real money exchanges. It’s a great way to learn, to see how shitty you’re going to do without losing a penny. DO THIS FOR TWO YEARS. Take whatever capital you have right now and buy some long term ETFs or solid ass stocks with minimal risk. Keep adding to it EVERY paycheck. Build up some capital for when you’re ready to trade for real. Take two years to learn how to trade, watch your paper portfolio go to zero a couple dozen times, read and follow the news, WSB, Stocktwits, etc. Ask questions, test out your strategies. You’ll thank me two years from now. 

**Tip 6 - Understand taxes**

Big difference between short term and long term capital gains. Uncle Sam loves you short timers. Paying taxes is for suckers. 

**Tip 7 - No one knows shit**

There is no crystal ball, no one has the “inside track”, and only believe 10% of what you read. Be very fucking skeptical. About everything. Social media, analysts, CEOs, news, all if it, be fucking skeptical. It’s all manipulation. Don’t even trust Buffett. You are the guardian of your capital. Everyone wants to take it it away from you. Understand that and you won’t get suckered so easily. 

**Tip 8 - Learn to read fundamentals and understand valuations**

As much as the market today feels like a casino, the underlying foundation of the market is investing, not gambling. With every stock you buy you’re buying a piece of a business. Learn to read fundamentals. Do they make money? Are they growing? Do they have debt? How are their competitors valued? Do they make more money today than they did 5 years ago? How will they make more? How do they return capital to shareholders? And on and on and on. Learn motherfuckers. Earnings per share. P/E rations. Intrinsic value. Net income. Figure out formulas for valuing stocks. Is TSLA worth over 250x earnings? Is WFC undervalued at 13x earnings? Investing blindly because big\_dick\_loser said so in a post is beyond idiotic. Just burn your money, you’ll have more fun. 

**Tip 9 - Get rich schemes are for suckers**

Remove the bookmark for Ferrari. You ain’t getting one anytime soon. Play fucking smart. Go long. Think in decades, not days. You’re not smart enough to day trade and beat the system. Not long-term anyways. Most of you won’t beat the market over 10 years. So be fucking smart. Paper trade until you can consistently prove gains month after month. When you’re ready to trade for real, dip in slowly. Fuck FOMO. Fuck YOLO. Remember, time is on your side. Compound that shit. 

**Tip 10 - Discipline and dedication**

Like anything in life, to be successful you have to fucking work at it. Easy money never lasts. Dig in, learn, practice, rinse and repeat. Be motivated to learn how to invest, take the time to study, read, test and constantly improve. Be disciplined with your money. It’s fucking hard to make, easy to lose. Protect that shit. 

\--

For those of you this resonates with, you’ll be fine long term. Do the fucking work. For those of you who love chasing the fantasy, good luck, I mean it. It’s a tough fucking pill to swallow watching your account get dwindled down to zero. Nothing tastes worse that losing all your money.

Abbott Laboratories is easy money. They make 5 minute covid testing strips, and have a government contract. Back in August they announced a $750 million contract with US government.
https://www.biospace.com/article/abbott-wins-750-million-contract-with-u-s-government-for-rapid-covid-19-test-/

With Biden in office, he wants to make testing more available and free to everyone, thats where Abbott comes in. They already have a government contract, and so things are only looking up for ABT. They had a low of $62 stock price on the year and it is currently $108 and climbing. Im not taking this as a yolo with weekly calls, Im going long because I am a pussy and going long with Jan 20, 2023 120 calls. They are sitting around $12 a call now and no way the stock doesn't go up in the next two years. Its free money. 

You might ask oh there is a vaccine coming, that will stop testing. Wrong. Not everyone is going to rush out and get the vaccine, and even if they do, schools, government etc will still make testing necessary and take precautions to make sure they aren't spreading covid. 

Thats not all, they are also helping out with diabetes among many other things, so the future of the company is bright.

TLDR: Jan 20 2023 120 calls because stocks only go up_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ GME ready for takeoff _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ BNTX: creators of the "Pfizer vaccine" will change the world and print tendies for all; the best bargain of vaccine stocks right now There have been a couple of (excellent) recent posts here about why Novavax (NVAX) is a good play with their vaccine in trials that are likely to succeed. But much like Jim Cramer and the rest on the day the "Pfizer vaccine" trial results were announced, everyone is looking for related plays and overlooking the company that created the first vaccine, started it all, and is going to change the world.

**Who is BioNTech, and what do they have to do with the Pfizer vaccine?**

BioNTech (BNTX) created the "Pfizer vaccine." Pfizer (PFE) is their partner for clinical trials and distribution (except Fosun Pharma is handling those duties in mainland China); BNTX is a direct peer and competitor to the better-known Moderna. A German company started by a married couple of Turkish immigrants, BNTX, like MRNA, has been working for years on messenger RNA-based therapeutics, especially for cancer, but it turns out messenger RNA (mRNA) is also an ideal technology for producing quick, effective, safe vaccines.

Much like PFE, BNTX tends to be quite conservative in their forward-looking public statements. This includes their initial announcement that their vaccine was "at least 90% effective," which turned out to be 95% effective. MRNA also does great work, but their CEO tends to be more of a "salesman" - which isn't all bad, but tends to get their gains priced in earlier than BNTX.

**The vaccine is not the biggest thing here though. BNTX is going to change the world.**

Vaccine revenue will be a big deal for BNTX (and for MRNA), and probably justifies share prices in the $140-$150 range, especially if annual boosters are needed for the vaccine (the jury is still out on that).

But the real upside in BNTX is that this vaccine - their first product coming to market - validates their entire technology platform based on messenger RNA (mRNA). Messenger RNA has been a bit of a "holy grail" in medicine for decades, but there were significant difficulties in turning it into a practical tool. It's fragile, and tended to induce the wrong kinds of immune reactions, from what I have read (I am not a doctor).

But BNTX and MRNA have cracked that code, using lipid nanocapsules to deliver the mRNA to cells, where it instructs the cells to create desired proteins; in the case of this vaccine, antibodies against the Coronavirus spike protein.

**But mRNA can be programmed - quickly, easily, and inexpensively - to instruct cells to create** ***any*** **proteins.**

Imagine a future where you receive a cancer diagnosis and your doctor takes a quick blood draw or biopsy, sends the results to a lab, and a week later you go back in for a shot that instructs your body how to destroy the tumor based on the specific genetic/chemical structure of your individual tumor. A future where programmable vaccines are created in days against new infectious diseases. A future where the body can create any proteins needed to cure a huge array of diseases and disorders.

Is this realistic?

Consider this: the Human Genome Project - a massive scientific success - took 13 years and $2.7 billion to sequence a single human genome. Now a human genome can be sequenced for something like $150 retail and takes a few days.

mRNA is going to be like that. Cheap, quick, custom therapies for many diseases that cause significant morbidity and mortality today.

And BioNTech and Moderna are leading the way (but BioNTech is currently the better buy).

**Recent price movements and comparison with peers and competitors:**

First, the more technical side. For most of the past month (since the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine results were announced), BioNTech has traded a bit above Moderna and Novavax in terms of per-share price (their pricing overall has been remarkably similar); BioNTech has tended to command a $5 to $10 premium over the two peers, with a brief larger premium in the week or so after the announcement.

But here's the thing: Moderna and Novavax took \~$25 per share gains Friday on the news of the AstraZeneca trial errors, while BioNTech only gained about $5 on the news, leaving Moderna and Novavax $15-$17 *above* BioNTech. That trend has only continued this morning, with Moderna now up to a $30 per share premium over BioNTech.

There is no real-world reason for this new premium. The AstraZeneca difficulties will benefit BNTX just as much as they benefit MRNA and NVAX. So why did it happen? Probably because BNTX is a German company and people think of their vaccine as the "Pfizer vaccine."

In addition, Barron's published a [story](https://www.barrons.com/articles/modernas-final-covid-vaccine-results-are-imminent-billions-in-revenue-will-follow-goldman-says-51606326525) about GS noting that MRNA will go from zero sales to billions of dollars next year and raised their price target from $107 to $139. All of this is true, and is now partially priced in. But all of it is also true of BNTX - but nobody has noticed yet; it's nowhere near priced in.

The Motley Fool guys are much the same - they published a [story](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/11/29/3-key-advantages-moderna-holds-pfizer-and-astra-z/) about MRNA's advantages over AZN and PFE - which made valid points - but completely ignored BNTX, when in fact *every* point they made in MRNA's favor applies even more to BNTX. They argue that MRNA being small is an advantage (because the vaccine results will affect their financials disproportionately), which is true. And they note that MRNA doesn't have to share revenue, unlike PFE and AZN - also true. And BNTX does have to share revenue with PFE (I've read elsewhere 50/50), but BNTX market cap is less than half of MRNA's, which ought to put them on level ground.

**Target price?**

I believe BNTX can go to $160 in the near term, meaning within the next two weeks (it's at $119.97 currently). Long term? I don't know; how much money can be made changing the face of medicine, especially cancer? PFE's market cap is $207B; AZN's is $138B. JNJ is $379B. I think it's entirely plausible that BNTX joins their ranks over the next few years; current BNTX market cap is $26.5B. So maybe a 10-bagger on just shares over the next few years?

**Is there a catalyst?**

Yes - in fact, there are two.

First, the FDA has a meeting on 12/10 to consider BNTX's application for an Emergency Use Authorization. This is thought to be nearly automatic; I cannot see a scenario where this is not granted quickly. There seems to be some sentiment that approval may even come that very day, which would make the 12/11 calls very attractive \*if\* it happens.

Second, PFE and BNTX are due to publish their actual trial data in a peer-reviewed journal very soon. Quite a few people seem to be taking something of a "wait and see" attitude toward the vaccine, saying they don't trust "press release data." This is not unreasonable. I see this as a strong upside though, because PFE and BNTX recent history is that they are \*very\* conservative with their public statements. The actual underlying data, when published, is likely to be even more favorable than their public statements. This is in contrast to MRNA, which tends to put the best face on their data (though their data is likely also very positive), and especially in contract to AZN, which put their spin machine in high gear with their recent results (and error) news.

**What's the play?**

Shares ought to return 25-35% just this month, and perhaps 100% annually over the next few years. If you want to try calls, a high-risk, high-reward play would be something like 135c 12/11; lower risk but still rewarding could be 125c 12/31.

**What about NVAX, MRNA, PFE, and AZN?**

Novavax and Moderna probably still have some upside. Novavax is still a month or two away from their Phase 3 results, which are likely (but not certain) to be positive (they have had successes and failures in their past). But NVAX stock is currently $15 above BNTX after trailing BNTX for weeks; I think their upside is currently more priced-in than BNTX (probably, again, because "Pfizer vaccine").

Moderna (MRNA), like BNTX, is going to be part of changing the world, and should be a solid investment. But their current market cap is double that of BNTX, and their stock has appreciated more recently (also $30 above BNTX despite consistently trailing BNTX until Friday). MRNA's boost is mostly priced in now. Both these stocks got boosts as "non-AZN vaccine stocks" on Friday because of AZN's difficulties; BNTX was simply overlooked.

Pfizer is a good company with good leadership, in my opinion. But it's a huge company; vaccine profits are unlikely to be material. It will move up and down, slow and boring, and pay dividends. If you want to buy PFE you should be at r/investing instead.

AZN is another giant company; their errors won't be material because they're selling the vaccine at cost anyway. But in my opinion they mishandled their communications regarding the error; I see them as another r/investing discussion, and a worse one than PFE.

All great companies, but at the moment BNTX is a bargain.

**What about the cold storage thing?**

Yes, the Pfizer/BioNTech requires colder storage than the other options. This is a challenge, but not as big a deal as it's being portrayed by some: the vaccine ships in reusable containers packed with dry ice that can keep the vaccine at the needed temperatures for 10 days without being in a freezer, and the dry ice can be refilled to last longer than that. And it can be pulled from that container and placed in a refrigerator for an additional 5 days. Yes, cold chain logistics will require some attention, but it's not a deal breaker.

**OK, but how do you know any of this?**

I'm not a medical professional, but I have had a lot of free time this year because my main gig  is shut down for Covid. So I have been following Covid news since mid-January (my other business's supply chain was being disrupted), and vaccine development since the beginning. I predicted early on that vaccines would be more effective than predictions were saying (90% or more vs 50-70%), I predicted that BNTX would be first past the gate, and I figured out that they were underplaying their own trial (they "hid" data from themselves for a couple of weeks to avoid an early announcement in order to let the trial run, since they had to wait for safety data for FDA anyway). I purchased 2,000 shares of BNTX about two weeks before the trial announcement and made some good gains. Unfortunately I'm a novice investor; this was my first big play, and I figured out options on RH right at closing time on the Friday afternoon before the big Monday morning announcement, so I was too late by about an hour to get in on even bigger gains.

I sold some shares near an early peak and bought/sold here and there since then; I currently hold 2,500 shares of BNTX shares, plus 115c 12/11 and 125c 12/31. I also hold MRNA, NVAX, \[banned SPAC ticker\], PSTH, and TMO in various amounts.

**TL;DR:** BioNTech created the Pfizer vaccine and owns 50% of the gross profits; much like Moderna, the vaccine is their first product to market and validates a technology platform (mRNA) that will change the world of medicine, but unlike Moderna, it's being overlooked a bit and presents a serious opportunity, both short term and long term. Their CEO and Chief Medical Officer are sleeping with each other, but they're married (yes, to each other), so it's fine. I should have posted this in October when I first bought in but I hadn't discovered this subreddit yet so I didn't and I'm sorry about that.

If you're a gamer you've probably heard about cyberpunk 2077. Due to delays with the game. CD Projekt (Ticker: OTGLY) has dropped from their August High. For those in not in the know CD Projekt also made the Witcher Series, and Saints Row. (Solid Reputation and History). However, with Cyberpunk set to release in December. Their stocks should bounce back in Dec/Jan.

If you can't buy it, time to get off RH_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ NKLA puts, wait or cash in for 1k? _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Palantir Adds $17 Billion in Value in Best Week Since Debut Palantir Technologies Inc. posted its best week since it went public in September, adding about $17 billion in market value as a broad rally in tech stocks helped fuel gains in the software maker.

Its shares rose 52% since Monday and touched a fresh intraday record at $33.50. The stock lost some of the gains on Friday after Citron Research said in a tweet it was shorting the stock with a $20 target. The company ended the session at $27.66.

Palantir representatives didn’t respond to a request for comment.

“A lot of institutions have probably warmed up to the company and are viewing it as something to hold onto for the long term,” said Wayne Kaufman, chief market analyst at Phoenix Financial Services. “It’s a great software company, and it has a terrific business, a very sticky business, not just with governments but also enterprises.”

Trading in Palantir options also surged this week with average daily volume of call contracts jumping about 250% in the first three days of the week when compared to the prior week. An analysis of open interest shows most of the contracts being opened and closed in the same day, indicating a heavy presence of day traders.

After an initial lackluster performance following its direct-listing stock debut, gains for the Denver-based firm, which sells data-analysis tools, have accelerated after hedge funds, including Steve Cohen’s Point72 Asset Management, reported purchasing the company’s shares.

“Big-data companies have become very important and historically have been excellent stocks. Also, Palantir is benefiting from the pandemic -- tracking cases and analyzing data is right in its wheelhouse,” Kaufman said.

Since starting up in 2003, co-founder and chairman Peter Thiel has helped bankroll the business throughout its long period as a closely held business. Now, the stock has gained nearly 300% since its direct listing. It reported third-quarter losses in its first financial results since going public as compensation costs surged. It did, however, boost its revenue growth forecast for the year to 44%, exceeding the amount analysts expected on average.

“I’d say the days of it trading below $20 are probably over,” Kaufman added.

Nikola Corporation (NASDAQ: NKLA) today announced the signing of a non-binding Memorandum of Understanding (“MOU”) with General Motors for a global supply agreement related to the integration of GM’s Hydrotec fuel-cell system into Nikola’s commercial semi-trucks. This supersedes and replaces the transaction announced on September 8, 2020.

Under the terms of the MOU, Nikola and GM will work together to integrate GM’s Hydrotec fuel-cell technology into Nikola’s Class 7 and Class 8 zero-emission semi-trucks for the medium- and long-haul trucking sectors. As previously announced, Nikola expects to begin testing production-engineered prototypes of its hydrogen fuel-cell powered trucks by the end of 2021, with testing for the beta prototypes expected to begin in the first half of 2022. In addition, Nikola and GM will discuss the potential for the utilization of GM’s versatile Ultium battery system in Nikola’s Class 7 and Class 8 vehicles._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $ZI Zoominfo issued 12.5m more shares for no money. Double whammy of shares dilution + lockup expiry is coming. Just minutes ago, $ZI filed S-1 registration file issuing an additional 12.5 million shares.

[https://sec.report/Document/0001628280-20-016873/](https://sec.report/Document/0001628280-20-016873/)

The issuing of the 12.5mil shares will not inject any capital into the company. As I quote, Zoominfo **"will not receive any proceeds from the sale of the shares by the selling stockholders.**" This **only creates dilution**. Remember, the existing outstanding shares are merely 69 million shares.

***Edit***\*: for people wondering how can a company issue shares for free, this is share dilution. The seller is Carlyle in this case. Please read the S-1 file, I cannot quote every sentence here. But in summary, ZI does not receive the proceeds for the share sale.\*

&#x200B;

**This share dilution, together with the coming lockup release, will create a huge downward impact on the share price of $ZI.**

&#x200B;

I have never heard of this company until Friday when fellow autist shared about its lockup expiry: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k2314t/you\_all\_are\_obsessed\_with\_pltr\_lockup\_but\_do\_you/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k2314t/you_all_are_obsessed_with_pltr_lockup_but_do_you/) I joined the trade because the logic is very consistent, rationale very clear.

"**If only 0.5% of locked shares are sold, this creates a selling pressure larger than 1 day's trading volume**" As I quote the author.

And now even more shares are issued for free, there is little chance (well nothing is impossible but just highly unlikely) its shares will go up in coming days.

Then there are trolls under the original DD post, arguing how lockups do not matter for stocks and may even drive them up, with **cherry-picked** examples trying to confuse other fellow autists. If you cherry-pick your example, you can make any shit ideas sound reasonable. **How about I cherry-pick a random date in March where stocks tanked 10%, and then argue stocks go down 10% every day forever. Does that make sense?** That is just retarded.

&#x200B;

I hereby summarize the logic of the original DD for your autists. If you find it reasonable, it is not too late to sell. If you don't find it reasonable, then do the opposite.

&#x200B;

1. **Share lockup release, generally, more often than not, statistically, drives stock price down**. Because there will be selling pressure from original shareholders. If you argue with this, then I don't know how I can help you.
2. If a stock's price has tanked significantly after IPO, people may wait until it recovers to take profit. If a stock's price has risen significantly, more people will take profits. Make sense? **$ZI has risen a whopping 140% since IPO.** Selling pressure is almost guaranteed.
3. If a stock's lockup releases a huge number of shares, this will create a larger selling pressure. If a stock's lockup releases only a few shares, then probably not much of an impact. **$ZI's lockup releases 320 million shares, 4.6 times its current outstanding.**

&#x200B;

**Does this really not make sense to you?**

&#x200B;

**I don't have position on NKLA I.m only sharing. Don't hate me for sharing news pls.**_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ listen up. WSB could literally own gamestop and it would be easy. Hey autists,

Listen up. currently there are 1.6 million of us, and there are roughly 41.5 million shares in the available float for gamestop.

[for all you smooth brains float means shares available to trade ](https://preview.redd.it/20ia1otgjd261.png?width=822&format=png&auto=webp&s=e88684e14577d963620631c5f9e8201a7bc28b57)

&#x200B;

by doing some simple math (41.5mil divided by 1.6 mil=25), we can see that if every one of us bought **only 25 shares** of gamestop, we would own **THE ENTIRETY OF THE FLOAT**

&#x200B;

edit: disclaimer for mods and sec retards: this is only showing a calculation and discussing a scenario, not encouraging any behavior!

&#x200B;

**TLDR: if everybody on wsb bought 25 shares of gamestop we would literally buy every share available, meaning gamestop would be ours.**_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Atleryx (AYX) this weird name company is going to the 🌝🌕 supp guys, hope you are ready for another busy week of loss porn and short selling reports that gonna destroy your accounts.

For all those of you who missed the pltr and gme train or are too scared to get in (if you are than gtfo of this subreddit), I'm going to show you a company that is so undervalued it hurts and its to take off soon🚀

**So what is Alteryx?**

glad you asked, Alteryx is a data analytics data science company that provides a platform for companies to perform analysis of the data, share it, and deploy lots of analytic models. The platform can be used by business analysts, programmers, and trained data scientists. The company wants to solve the problem of wasting time in the organization for doing simple Data analytics. As for 2020 60 BILLION DOLLARS per year wasted on analysts doing repetitive manual work in spreadsheets. The uniqueness of this company is that the interface of the platform is very intuitive and user friendly, using drag and drop interface and mainly reduces the need to write complex software code. Their platform is designed to interact with almost any data source, starting from IBM, Microsoft, Oracle, and SAP to AWS, Google Analytics, Workday, and more.

**Who are the customers?**

So the company has, as of 2020, approx. 7000 customers in more than 90 countries and big names like Netflix, Salesforce, Toyota, Chevron, Uber, Twitter, Xerox, Nasdaq, and many more. The company already has a name in the big boys' playground and we can expect it to continue to expand.

**Tell me more, please.**

No problem amigo. The company continues its growth strategy by a series of acquisitions mainly for developing tools and talented people. in 2019 they acquired ClearStory Data mainly because the developers are very good and can leverage them to help to develop and improve their tools. They acquired Feature Labs to augment their machine learning capabilities and to penetrate to the East coast of the US. Also the company announced strategic alliances with Adobe, UiPath and ABBYY to accelerate adoption of APA (analytic process automation) which altreyx is a leader at.

Alteryx is a subscription-based software which makes it a SaaS company the same as TTD, Shopify and so on, but it focuses on analytics. Their main competitors are the big software companies (IBM, Microsoft, SAP) and some small ones which most of them are private.                  So in order to compare them to check if they are under/overvalued, I will use companies in the same field as Datadog, Splunk, and more.

**Let's dig in for some numbers**

Annual revenue has increased from 86M to 418M in just 4 years (2016-2019) that is a 48% CAGR which is amazing. This year the company expects to grow revenues at around 15% mainly because of covid, which made companies cut expenses.

Q3 revenues growth is 38% YOY, customer growth is 24% YOY.                                                        Gross Margin is 93% (Amazing) Operating Margin is 24%. This company is super efficient and with great margins.

The company is profitable as of the 3Q with a positive EPS of 0.07. It uses more than 50% of its gross profit for R&D which is exactly what we want to see in a growing tech company.

**Balance Sheet**

Cash is down to 95M from 409M mainly because of acquisitions, but short term investments are almost double YOY with 627M. **Current Ration** is 1:4 approx. and **asset to liabilities ratio** is 1.5:1 so the company is indeed solvent and can survive even stuff like covid. Liabilities wise the company has 650M in convertible bonds which as we see can be covered by the short-term investments, It is something we should consider when the company starts to underperform, not now though.

Cash from Operating Activities for the 3Q is 16.3 M an improvement of 20%.                                      FCF is negative for the quarter mainly because of the investments they made (240M).

So the company is performing really well so far this year and is able to grow despite covid and companies reducing expenses. Of course, they need to increase their FCF but as long as they are growing and acquiring companies it's all good.

**Let's use some gay TA to see what's going on**

&#x200B;

[AYX 1 day chart](https://preview.redd.it/eu91ywiifd261.jpg?width=1374&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=96335b788ca104400101c7f29fdc13435ce4aac7)

Well as you see AYX is in a range for quite a while (since May) with 104 and 80 acting as support and 150 and 178 as resistance. It hits 104 twice and couldn't break it and in the last 2 weeks, it tried again, and again was denied.

So the stock can now go to 150 easily or contest again the 104 level. with the tech trend going up I can see it going to retest that 150 level hoping to break it.

**Now we compare this company with other companies**

* SNOW: ‘21 EV / Rev = \~100x
* DDOG: ‘21 EV / Rev = \~ 40x
* MongoDB: ‘21 EV / Rev = \~ 25x
* **Alteryx: ‘21 EV / Rev = \~ 15x**
* JFROG: ‘21 EV / Rev = \~ 30x
* PLTR ‘21 EV / Rev = \~ 50x

(thanks  [u/xwpv8j62](https://new.reddit.com/user/xwpv8j62/) for the info)

As you see AYX is the most UNDERVALUED company here which means a lot of room to grow.

Gross Margin:

**AYX- 92%**

DDOG- 78%

SNOW - 55%

MongoDB- 69%

P/S Ratio:

**AYX-  16.95**

DDOG- 51.71

SNOW - 150.15

MONGODB-  30.88

PLTR - 47.76

AYX has the best margin, best ratios, and still is way undervalued than its peers. This is wrong and YOU have a chance to take advantage of it.

**TL:DR,**  Shares and January Calls at 120/130 strike will do the work.

Have fun guys happy trading and tendies for y'all.

Madison Square Garden, Vegas Sphere, Radio City Music Hall, Beacon Theater, Chicago Theater = roughly $4B. You can subtract about $1B, conservatively, for the value of MSG used in sporting events, which will go to the MSGS stock.

So the assets they hold likely outweigh their current Market cap (1.86B) by over a billion.

2) In particular, Las Vegas Sphere ([www.msgsphere.com](http://www.msgsphere.com/)) deserves mention – this looks for all intents and purposes mind-blowing, game-changing entertainment venue. They are in talks to build another one in London. The obvious negative factor is Covid, but with the vaccine allowing return to such entertainment venues, this WILL explode once construction is finished (estimated 2023)

3) Average target is around $100 including recently by JP Morgan,  currently trading around $77. 

4) The one downside: James Dolan has large ownership.

Don’t take my word for it, there is a recent analyses (google MSGE analysis) by Seeking Alpha (can I mention that here?) which provides more in depth.

So, (4) aside, why does this stock get no interest or love? I see almost no volume per day. If people are so interested Las Vegas Sands, MGM etc, why not this, which IMO also has huge upside?

Halp a major retard _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Why DOCU will be the best YOLO candidate this week, BETTER THAN PLTR (lots of research) When news of the Pfizer vaccine broke out, and subsequently broke markets (temporarily), I thought that the news-reported "rotation" out of stay-at-home and tech stocks into value stocks provided an immense opportunity to trade some of the popular tickers. In fact, I suspected that the FOMO people felt from missing out on the run following the election was replaced with a skeptical, contrarian viewpoint that life may return to pre-COVID times and stocks return to pre-COVID valuation levels.

I believe the skepticism around the rise of tech is an honest mistake. The effects of COVID on financial markets are not the result of temporary government measures, but likely of permanent regime changes. Let me roll with this as an assumption; you are already probably familiar with the concepts of MP3, rising anti-capitalist populism, a rotation out of cities, large stimulus measures, and a strengthening challenge from China against the dollar as a reserve currency. For those who recognize that 2020 is a regime change and not a temporary boost (or decline, depending on industry), there are plenty of plays worth discussing. I am intentionally going to ignore the discussion around hype stocks, like those in the EV and cannabis craze. Instead, I'm going to focus on a lesser talked about stock, that is still "big tech" related, in a high growth phase, and not as speculative as far as valuation is concerned. A stock like that, which does not get a lot of attention, has its moments. This week could be one of those moments, where being in it before a new wave of investors rush in might pay off nicely. Let me share the analysis I have done so far on Docusign ($DOCU).

**Notable Company Features**

DOCU's self-declared TAM is $25 billion just for the eSignature space, in which they are obviously the top player, and they also have efforts underway for a whole Suite solution, expansion (importantly, into international markets), and vertical integration. They're projected to bring in under $2 billion of that this year, so they are very much still in high growth phases, spending a lot of sales/marketing and R&D. It's not hard to see DOCU making tens of billions of dollars of revenue down the road, and this week could cement people's belief that a higher valuation is due to come sooner.

Employees also really like working at the California-based company. It ranks as one of the best companies on Glassdoor, with over 95% of people recommending the company and giving CEO approval. This piece of metadata is often very useful; great companies attract great talent.

**Fundamental Analysis**

Based on my analysis and my limited experience with financial statements, I think that the most important metric to look out for when DOCU reports earnings is going to be revenue, and how that feeds into year-over-year gross profit growth. I looked at different revenue and expense scenarios, and there wasn't much sensitivity around the consensus net loss per share estimate, of minus 32 cents. However, the year-over-year Q3 growth is estimated to be between 40 - 50% (reverse-engineering their guidance and consensus estimates gets me 42%), and my calculations show it's likely to beat the 50% mark, which I assume to be psychologically significant because growth has stayed at around 40% for over the past year.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/y6i9hnfdib261.png?width=1092&format=png&auto=webp&s=ffcd6b3566d4bf27567864e40d48c41c328bb2b5

In the past two years, DOCU has experienced revenue growth of around 10% quarter-over-quarter. It's maintained an incredibly stable gross profit margin (everything is presented on a GAAP basis) of about 75%. The company's guidance for this quarter shows only a 5.5% growth in revenue against prior quarter, which looks to me like it's extremely conservative, just like the consensus estimate for Zoom in their earnings this week. Notably, both companies have beaten every quarter's revenue estimates in the past two years.

My "base case" for revenue growth is 13%; that's a little less than the 15% from last quarter, and keeping gross profit % flat as well, nets a gross profit growth of 52% year-over-year. I think it's probably likely that we will see gross profit growth of around 50%. Cost of revenue grew 22% last quarter; that was unusual, and I suspect it's related to the free trials. If true, then we should expect cost of revenue to go back to trend, growing in line with actual revenue and keeping gross profit margins neutral.

My "bad case" and "good case" call for gross profit growths of 38% and 61%, respectively. They use lower/higher growth rates for revenue, keeping gross profit margins flat as well. I also tweaked some operating expense assumptions in the second half of the table (see Appendix), in which I calculated a net loss per share. The consensus estimate on net loss per share looks a bit more optimistic. It is 32 cents, and my base, bad, and good case call for 34, 47, and 30 cents respectively.

Overall, I expect DOCU to comfortably beat revenue earnings by several percentage points, but the downstream impact into the final net loss per share value is unlikely to surprise.

**Technical Analysis**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9pgw9tcjib261.png?width=860&format=png&auto=webp&s=44f7ac48dcc1e8e7f0891d9c9d649e261e26c5cf

With only about 1% of shares trading hands on an average day, DOCU looks like a stock primed to win. It's been in a very tight trading range for almost the past 5 months, which followed a big rally. Looking at the volume by price indicator, it has done a lot of mean-reverting to the $215 level. More recently, it has tried to escape, getting bought up at $195 and sold at $235 more than once. That's $20 in either direction. Notably, the straddle on next week when it reports earnings shows a $22 move. DOCU's earnings is after-hours on Thursday, which follows just three days after Zoom reports its earnings. This means that we will have a good sense ahead of time of whether DOCU, which is a direct beneficiary of the COVID-era like Zoom, can maintain their explosive growth.

Looking at the broader market, the dollar is sitting at a multi-year low, and it is currently on a downward trend, which just needs a reasonable catalyst to start a lower leg down. That would presumably raise equity valuation levels. In addition, the Nasdaq is "only" around 25% higher than its high from February; some names gained far more than others. If you believe in the regime change from physical to virtual, all the new monetary/fiscal mechanisms to support financial markets, the democratization of investing through commission-free trades drawing in new investors (a majority of which buy and hold, raising demand), existing mania around the markets, a changing administration that will be less likely to provoke markets with tweets, and the general desensitization of the average investor, then you probably have an optimistic view like me.

**Conclusion**

Docusign reports earnings this week. Zoom reports a few days earlier, giving us an early read. Because DOCU has relatively stable finances, I think Zoom will provide key insights into what to expect. Technical indicators are strong. Revenue is likely to beat, and gross profit margin growth could impress. DOCU is an underdog in terms of hype stocks, but has all the characteristics needed to get a lot of attention. And the product that they sell is extremely well received, and they clearly have attracted a lot of talent. All said, a new leg up in DOCU's valuation looks like a real possibility._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ TSLA- buy the rumour, sell the news(remeber) Ok, so TSLA will be included in S&P 500 in Dec 21. Old news. Around $100B(almost 1/5th of its market cap) of TSLA would need to be purchased(some active funds may have already purchased) based on current stock price.

The only reason I have been holding TSLA after it split is the whole S&P 500 inclusion thingy. After that, I don't know what will even move this stock. They freakin surpassed Bekshire and could surpass Facebook(for a short time)!!!

Today they will announce whether to include TSLA in two sessions or in one session.

[This is what happened when Yahoo was included\(which is comparable to TSLA's inclusion as they have had relatively comparable size in comparison to S&P 500's size\)](https://preview.redd.it/czcweg5oeb261.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=de2ff9033b37cd1051703ffffb7c47fafa1f7444)

After the trading sessions, expect a big dip. As a lot of speculators this year have bought into TSLA precisely to f\*\*k the index investors.

Also the trade date Dec. 18, coincides with a once-quarterly event known as quadruple witching, the Friday near the end of each calendar quarter on which options and futures on both indexes and stocks expire simultaneously. Volume is usually heavy on those days and would help boost liquidity on the day of Tesla’s inclusion, investors said.(this paragraph copied straight from wsj)

So, I guess don't be a fool(unless there are some tax implications, which I don't have); buy the rumour, sell the news. TSLA will completely tank after the inclusion.

Also, remember NIO, XPEV etc kind of benefit from the TSLA hype, so be very careful you all about them.

I don't think if you don't have any immediate tax implications, there wouldn't be much value holding TSLA for the longer term as there are better long term plays. And when or if TSLA reaches $700 or higher(I know I am very bullish, but that's why I am a retard) there would be almost no point in holding it any longer._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ (DD)Bullish case for PG&E Look guys, there is sweet tendies to be had on these meme stocks and dont think for a damn second I am not feasting on them. But for the sake of diversification it doesnt hurt to look and see where there are more tendies to be had.
PG&E Has had a rough ride but it is through the fire at this point. Pun intended. So Im gonna lay out some key reasonings as to why Im bullish on PCG and you should be too.

1. They are a monopoly on power distribution in the most expensive places to live in the world.

2. Before covid they were on the rise, because of the fires they have been left behind as every other stock is back to pre covid levels. This alone should be a massive bullish case

3. Looking at the 52 week chart, **exactly one year ago PCG went on an absolutely insane bull run FROM $7 TO $18.** At some point this shit is gonna happen again.

4. Hedge funds have been loading up on it.
Fire season is over and they handled it perfectly, beyond that in they have an agreement with the state now where they will not be solely responsible for any fires.

5. The inevitability of dividend reinstatement and the free reign they have to bring it back. In the bankruptcy agreement they agreed to not reinstate a dividend until 6 billion in non-GAAP earnings. What the fuck is non-GAAP? That means non generally accepted accounting principles. So they could literally make up any reason at any time, as to how they earned 6 billion dollars. “Hey guys, every dollar we earned and got a loan for is earnings even though we didnt account for ITDA.” Nerds;”Hey PGE thats not generally accepted” PGE; “Exactly you retards, why would you let us do this”. They are on track to reinstate them based off of their average annual non-GAAP earnings in 2021 but you never know.

The last point should be the most bullish case for PCG. Dividend reinstatement is inevitable and when it happens every single boomer retirement and pension fund is going to race into this shit. Before the first fire case it had a share price of $70. Once the dividend is back this shit will have a tesla level bull run.

So dont be a 🌈🐻 and fucking pump this shit up because if we can get some meme-mentum behind this it will be insane.

So I commented on what’s your next big gay move for tomorrow and some people responded and wanted more info.

The ticket we are looking at today is VRM, which is for Vroom company. They won’t bring you to mars but you can definitely get a nice car if this doesn’t goes tits up.

Valued at currently just slightly under 5bn. My current prediction is that there is an upside if 2-3x minimum from the current price. 

What’s interesting about this company is that they are a direct competitor against Carvana $CVNA which is currently valued at 40bn and around 2.5x the amount of sales. 

Why? If we take a look at the debt to equity ratio of VRM the company is backed by private equity and has zero debt. With debt being cheaper than equity, if the company were to take on debt, this would drive valuation upward. Edit* 0.2 short term debt, 0 LTD

Another thing to note is that being a car company, it’s not often that you see inventory and warehousing is all funded by equity. The pockets are deep and healthy. Currently with a price to book value of 9, the company is really under valued.

Some other noteworthy things is that the execs of the Priceline group are all backers of vroom, and so is Bill Gates fund. 

So how do I get my FREE, used Porsche 911? The current play would be to buy shares, or dated options. With a price of $37, 2-3x is easily reached if the 5bn if valuation moves to 12/15. Which is in line with the industry.

Dogfood to $100. I always see blue themed packages from Chewy lying around at my apartment's package room and decided to look it up.

**Chewy, Inc.** is an e-commerce company of pet food and other pet-related products. They have earnings coming up on 12/08.

From Wikipedia,

>By 2017, the company had revenue of approximately $2 billion and 51% of online pet food sales in the US.

With no dominant competitors, they likely have more than 70% of online pet food market share now.

With the Covid e-commerce boom, they are growing fast. In last quarter report, they posted net sales of $1.70 billion, which grew 47 percent year-over-year. In the quarter prior to that, they had net sales of  net sales of $1.62 billion which grew 46 percent year-over-year.

They are moving towards profitability quarter by quarter and it is possible that for the Q3, they will be able to breakeven or even become profitable.

Last 12 month revenue is $6 billion, and currently it has $30 billion market cap. Just 6 times the sales.

They also have 389 open positions, which is \~3% of their workforce: [https://www.chewy.com/jobs](https://www.chewy.com/jobs)

With their earnings coming up on 12/08 and other e-commerce stocks swinging upwards, this will easily run up to $100. For the last 2 earnings report, it did run up \~15% prior to earnings.

The run up has already started and it will keep going on for the week.

**TLDR**: Dogfood e-commerce company with solid financials. Earnings coming up.  Get on the train.

I bought following WSB DD and wondering if I should just sell since it's up now I bought a couple hundred shares three months ago because of some DD posted here, without having heard of the company before. It gave me a 6-7% dividend soon after. It dropped a bit and stayed flat for a while so I figured it was a bad buy, but lazily held it and it's up like 40% since then. 

I tried to google news about the company, but found nothing new, so I can't tell if anything really changed. Given that I wouldn't buy Vale at this price, it should mean I should sell it instead of holding at this price, correct? 

It has a neutral rating from analysts.

Is there any public positive news about the company that I'm missing?

**Holiday Shopping -** With the surge in the ecomm sales & anticipated record peak holiday season UPS has press-released that they ***would be hiring over 100K workers*** to help them with handle the demand. 

&#x200B;

Btw, I love all you nerds. You make this subreddit the special place that it is. Xoxo_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Delisting of Chinese Stocks & What You Should Know I see a lot of misinformation going on around here regarding the bill that is to pass. I am going to try and clear that up.

BABA, NIO, etc. are currently audited by PwC China. This in itself **does not mean** that they are automatically okay. PwC Canada, PwC America, etc. are all subject to audits from the PCAOB. PwC China's government officials have, **to this day**, not allowed the PCAOB to conduct an audit investigation into PwC China, their audit procedures/protocols, etc. As a result, **the PCAOB does not have reasonable assurance** that PwC China is conducting their audits in accordance with U.S. regulations.

Don't believe me? Read BABA's annual reports where they state this:

*PricewaterhouseCoopers, our auditor, is required under U.S. law to undergo regular inspections by the PCAOB. However, without approval from the Chinese government authorities, the PCAOB is currently unable to conduct inspections of the audit work and practices of PCAOB-registered audit firms within the PRC on a basis comparable to other non-U.S. jurisdictions. Since we have substantial operations in the PRC, our auditor and its audit work are currently not fully inspected by the PCAOB.*

This is **not just an issue of BABA, NIO, etc. complying with U.S. GAAP**. If anything, BABA, NIO, etc. would pay the higher accounting fees to be in accordance with U.S. regulations/GAAP. **The issue is between PCAOB and PwC China/Chinese government officials who are disallowing the PCAOB from conducting their normal investigations/audits on auditing firms**.

This bill will put pressure on them to begin allowing public sector audits, but if China continues to resist, BABA, NIO, etc. will **not** be safe._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ WSBVoteBot Log for Nov 30 2020 Every time a new submission is posted to wallstreetbets /u/wsbvotebot posts a comment that allows you to click and vote to remove that submission.

Ok retards, GME ShortSqueeze is not going to happen. But what will happen is the share price will pop. Currently they have a shit load of cash. How come they have so much cash despite losing about 1b over the past 2 financial years and not raising money thru debt or equity.

Well some autist accountant back in the day decided to create some bullshit called double entry. GME bought some companies along the way which resulted in Goodwill. Which is basically the premium above net assets GME bought acquisitions for EB games ect.

As a result GME had a Profit of 74m total over the past 2 years before tax when you add back the goodwill impairment. Goodwill impairment over the last 2 years was roughly 1.3b.

Why is this important? Because the business for the past 2 years has been treated as a bankrupt despite actually holding its own in a digital era. If leadership manage to realise they can get out of most of the lease in the next 2 years and move to an online sale delivery plus pick up in store at foot traffic heavy locations / most profitable stores GME will remain profitable and cash flow positive for years to come.

TLDR; Adding back fake accounting losses for the past 2 years results in a profitable company._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ TD Sequential Countdown NIO For who doesn’t know what I’m talkin about I posted a picture with the definition of this indicator :

https://imgur.com/gallery/KVC2XFu

That being said, the graph is :

https://imgur.com/gallery/X4GwsiJ

From my analysis ( and I can I be wrong but statistically speaking I’m probably not ) . So from the graph we can see that there are 8 closures greater than the maximum of the second that precedes, and in simple words it means that in about 2 weeks there’s a high chance that NIO is going to sell off massively. That doesn’t mean that you can’t keep making money off NIO for the following week but from then, it’s going to be rough. Always keep in mind that if you bought high your are going to regret it, and if you bought low your going to regret it anyway for not taking the profit. 

My next week Move :

There is a chance that nothing of what I said is going to happen. But I’m going to hold my contracts for a week on NIO ( expiring in about a month ) and stock shares and sell everything somewhere near 10-11 December. Fifth wave on NIO is started and in about 8 candles ( that translates in 2 weeks ) we are going to see if my prediction is correct.
