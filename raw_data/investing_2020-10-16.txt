Why aren't more people talking about cold storage like Americold? X-post from https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/jcia05/why_arent_more_people_talking_about_cold_storage/

Thought I'd ask it here:

Americold's operating income since 2018 has been rock solid stable. They are second largest storage supplier in the world after Lineage Logistics, and they're thriving even more in the pandemic.

There will be billions of doses for the vaccine over the next 12 months, and these vaccines [need to be temperature-controlled](https://www.wsj.com/articles/covid-19-vaccine-race-turns-deep-freezers-into-a-hot-commodity-11599217201).

`COLD` has been on a roll with acquisitions in the US and Europe over the past couple of months, including the third largest cold storage player in Europe:

Found it on LinkedIn and it has some interesting information I hadn’t seen elsewhere.  Hope it’s as helpful to some of you as it was for me.

[Market commentary ](https://www.k2financialpartners.com/market-update)_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Is there interest for DD focused sub? Is there, or would there be interest in a DD focused subreddit? 

As much as I like the current subreddits I am a part of I don't like sitting through beginner questions and speculation with no DD. I think a subreddit for simple stuff is important but I also feel it could be beneficial for a more technical focused subreddit which removes speculation. I would like to guage interest in both the subreddit itself and mods to help me out if it has enough interest._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ What is the truth behind the statement that very few people are able to beat the market? Because Reddit seems to be good at picking out winners not only in the short term, but in 4-5 year time spans as well… I’ve seen a lot of topics from 2016-2017 where people were bullish on companies like AMD (40x), MSFT (4x), NVDA (20x), TSLA (9x). Some were bullish on failures like GE, and Intel but even if you picked those as well, you still would’ve been up tremendously over the market.

The stocks that Reddit were hyping 4-5 months ago and are still hyping up today, NET (1.8x), DKNG (2.5x), SQ (3x), ARKK (2x) have also done very well… And it’s not like these are short term stocks either. They all have huge growth opportunities 5-10 years down the line.

In contrast on average it takes 7 years for an S&P 500 ETF to 2x. Statistically, it would take 7+ years for my investment in VTI to reach the same % gains as the investment I made in DKNG 5 months ago. Furthermore you’d have to wait 20+ years just for VOO and VTI to reach 8x valuations. Most of us would be in our late 40s, or early 50s by then.

As a young person I’d rather take a medium risk, high reward opportunity, than a very-low risk low-reward opportunity.

And yet over and over again, we’re told that very few people are able to beat the market, and you’re better off just dumping everything into an S&P 500 index fund and holding. But the more I lurk on this subreddit and various other investing communities, the more I question that statement.

I’m thinking many people underperform the market because they make emotional decisions. They try to time the market, sell innovative companies for a measly 1.5x gain only to buy back again at a higher price due to fomo, liquidate everything on the slightest hint of bad news and so forth. Just like the statistic that got posted, where the Magellan Fund averaged 20% / year over 10 years, but the people who bought into the fund actually had a net negative. And overall there are far more investors like that in general rather than people who know to just buy and hold onto a stock with long term prospects._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Thoughts on Titan Medical (TMDI) Titan recently got a new CFO,Monique Delorme and they have added new members to their boar.  The company is rebranding their Sport Robot to ENOS, but they have been down for a while. They are trying to compete with Intuitive in the single port surgical robot area, but are they set up to do so?  Medtronic has aligned with Titan to develop their own surgical robots, but it seems like Titan will still be able to develop on their own during this time.  Is Titan worth grabbing up now or wait and see?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Nikola -15% on CEO's 'go it alone' comments Nikola (NASDAQ:NKLA) falls sharply after CEO Mark Russell says he sees a path for the company even if it can't work out a deal with General Motors (NYSE:GM) on a strategic partnership.

"We have the ability and we have a base plan of doing it ourselves. If we have a partner, that just enables us to consider going faster and helps reduce the risk," states Russell.

Nikola is prepared to drop the Badger truck from its production plans if it can’t secure an agreement with an original equipment manufacturer like GM.

Talks between Nikola and GM are said to be still going on.

Shares of Nikola are down 14.88% and have traded as low as $19.63 during the session. GM is up 1.85%.

Can someone help me understand what happened to my 50 shares in SKYS?  Is there anything I need to do to redeem another type of equity or cash resulting from the sale?   I think I’m in this group, but I’m not sure what to expect for next steps: “Instructions outlining the steps required to be taken to obtain the merger consideration will be provided to Sky Solar’s shareholders who did not tender their Ordinary Shares and/or ADSs in the Offer. Square Limited, which wholly owns Square Acquisition Co., intends to cause all the Company’s ADSs to be delisted from Nasdaq and the Ordinary Shares deregistered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.”

When I look at REITs though, I just see a stock price and an average dividend yield. What separates it from just investing in a MSFT or some dividend stock? What's so enticing about REITs?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Secular Bull Market for Aluminum | Alcoa | AA One of the necessary infrastructure spending needed for renewable is more transmission line to move electricity from States oversupplied with renewables energy to other State.

Atm it's still a penny stock... nothing interesting, right?
However, yahoo finance, is is filled with 'relievers'. 
Besides that, news articles state that RLF's authorization geven by the EUA and the FDA is close. 
This event happening would mean billions in revenue to come for RLF. 

Besides that, research has 'proven' that RLF's medication increases the survival rate of Covid- sufferers. 

Furthermore, RLF arranged a partnership with NeuroRx. NeuroRx is trying to get listed on an american stock exchange via a reverse merger. 

What do you guys think?

I've done some research on hedge funds and their strategies etc. and as their name states, a lot of them are hedging. Now, if I read that correctly, hedging means buying and selling the same asset **with the purpose of reducing risk**.  To some of you that's probably going to sound stupid but whe wouldn't you just reduce your position size to minimize risk?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_
