 At what point are we going to realize OUR MONEY WAS STOLEN FROM US? RH, Citadel, and other Federal Reserve cronies blocked the squeeze a couple weeks back. I know it is a hard pill to swallow. Like most victims of scammers, you are too embarrassed to admit you have been scammed.

By blocking the squeeze, they literally took  money from our pockets. Your money is gone. GME, BB, AMC, et al. stocks were counterfeited, the price reduced, and your money is gone. 

Believing that the federal reserve is going to allow you to fuck up their scamming game called the stock market is laughable. 

I lost some money too, but not a lot. If you want to hold, by all means, d so. But, to buy this stock thinking it's going to go back up to $500+, it's preposterous. 

When you bet, sometimes you lose. When you bet against the federal reserve: heads they win- tails you lose. 

#RH and The Dudes at The Federal Reserve STOLE OUR MONEY

#Thieves_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ BBY-Best Buy Stockholders I don’t know if anyone here holds any stock in Best Buy but as a head’s up... Best Buy is cutting thousands of their employees today in order to help the bottom line and stroke off investors. Seeing it in r/bestbuy. Many employees that have stock are mentioning selling it in order to backfire CEO’s plans. I have a lot of old coworkers planning on doing the same. So one could speculate to prepare for a drop in prices. At least in the short term. But also keep in mind that less employees in an already short staffed company means lower customer satisfaction and less shoppers. 
Not insider trading, the company cuts are all over their subreddit.
Do with the information as you will. 
Happy investing.

Edit: Short term :), long term :(
Not financial advice, just information._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $BA, the hidden golden egg So, I'm pretty retarded. Been here for a few months, know a bit, but I'm more of an expert in aircraft. Recently, as you may know, Boeing suffered several major issues with their 737 MAX aircraft, resulting in a 100 USD plunge. Soon after, the Corona virus appeared no less than a year later, resulting in an additional 200 USD plunge. They couldn't just stop the production line, and thus it resulted in Boeing having to [park dozens of their aircraft in the employee parking lot.](https://images.indianexpress.com/2019/06/boeing-737-max-grounded-parking-lot-759.jpg)

However, that's not important. What is important is the recent news that the 737 MAX is now allowed to fly once again, after being grounded since early 2019. This is also in line with the vaccine role out, which is likely going to result in a $BA surge back to it's original price or higher, due to the significant want to travel. Luckily for Boeing, they've got dozens of aircraft already prepped for use, they just need to sell them again. While the stock has been slow to recover, it looks like it will rebound and swing for the fences as airports reopen and people want to travel after being locked inside for so long, leading to a lucrative opportunity in the near future. 

TL;DR [Boeing, rocket emoji, 200 dollars, green arrow, moon](https://imgur.com/gallery/Ft8d3sF)

FOR THE SQUEEZETH SHALL SQUOZE._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ The Wall the Fish Built - Path to the Moon Part 3 Once upon a time a bunch of **Retarded Fish** began **Holding** up a wall to keep some snakes out. 

Because they were fish and they were retarded they did not know why they were keeping the wall up, they just kept holding. And holding, and holding. As the wall got **smaller** and **smaller** and **smaller**.

This inevitably **cost the fish** lots of energy. So much energy that getting the wall any higher seemed an impossibility. The retarded fish had **no other ideas** and they bickered with each other and snapped at each other for many days. 

Along came a Snail with an **idea so obvious** to him that it was **laughable** that the fish could not see it. Maybe they were just **too close to the problem**. Maybe they were **greedy** and each fish wanted the wall for himself. Maybe they were all retarded. Maybe **they enjoyed being anally reamed**. That it was a pleasure for them to be penetrated so. 

The idea was simple. All it really involved was **leverage**. But the retarded fish didn't understand what leverage meant. They **gave that up to build the wall** in the first place. They had no idea what leverage looked like when they had it themselves. Stupid retarded fish, **leverage is what you are holding,** spoke the Snail.

By dropping that wall, falling back and building the wall at **lower level**, with many **more fish**. They could build a wall that would keep the snakes out. All it would take is some coordination between the **Big Fish** and the **Little Fish**. The **Little Fish** could **retreat** and get ready to build the wall from a **comfortable foundation**. The **Big Fish** could **throw stones** at the snakes **one at a time.** Potentially knocking one out. Once at a level that was desirable and **approachable** from both Big Fish and Little Fish, the Wall could be built on **solid foundations**. Gradually the Fish could **collect stones** for the next push forward **with reinforcements**.

The **Snakes** would relish the opportunity for advancement and **overextend themselves**. They would lead themselves into a **point of no return**. But for the tenacity of the Retarded Fish. Once they get an idea in their heads, it is very hard to change their minds.

But the retarded fish thought the Snails idea was stupid. "**Leverage**," they said "What's a wall got to do with **Leverage**? Go away crazy Snail. You clearly don't know anything about walls or how to build them. We spent all this energy building this **stupid shitty wall** to this height, you want us to **take it down**. You sound like a snake, you sound like a robot! Psssh... **Leverage**, who does this Snail think he is?!"

The Snail sighed again, as looked upon the struggling fish. He forgave them for their insults. They **did not recognise him** or know he was. They could not see past his **clever disguise,** disguised as a Snail as he was. They did not **know the names** he carried with him in his time. Or the **many battles he had already won**, very similar to this one. If he told them they would never believe him, the Retarded Fish **only believed what was on the screen** in front of them. **As the image of the Wall went down** and down and further down and back up again and down again. Caught in an **endless stalemate**.

**Poor Retarded Fish**! Such a **simple existence** they must get to live, building a wall, only to watch it fall down again and again... It must be **so hard** being Retarded Fish all day. If only they would **try the Snails idea** even if **for lack of a better one**. It's not as if they weren't a **bunch of losers** already. 

**Determined** they were, **to waste more energy**. The Wise Snail looked on and laughed as each day passed and **the Wall the Retarded Fish Built got smaller and smaller**. 

*Silly fish, silly fish,* 

***all thinking as one***

I'm here today to tell you about 2 good gold miner stocks I did my DD on, B2Gold \[$BTG\] and Yamana Gold \[$AUY\]!

My DD on B2Gold goes as follows. ITS UNDERVALUED! BTG produces 1 million OZ of Shiny pretty GOLD a year, has practically no debt (121k as of start of 2020). Half a billion cash on hand! Has a P/E Ratio of 8. The dividend the company pays is $0.04/share quarterly. The sales revenue in 2015 was 708.33 Million and in 2019 it was 1.53 Billion, year 2020 will probably top 2019 since gold price went up. Total assets of the company are at around 3.48 Billion while the liabilities are 818.79 Million. Gross Income in 2019 was $597.71 Million. The price of a stock is currently sitting at $5.05 Which is laughably undervalued .🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Yamana Gold \[$AUY\] Slightly worse than B2Gold but still worthy stonk! Price per share currently at $4.91. Total debt at the beginning of 2020 was $991K. Gross Income in 2019 was $446 Million. It has a dividend of 0.02/share quarterly . P/E Ratio of 40 which is kind of poor. But the company is still worth way more than the sub $5 price it's currently at! The company is targeting production of gold to exceed 1 million oz per year! It also produces silver which is an additional bonus! 🚀🚀🚀

Full disclosure I'm 2000 Shares deep in B2Gold, average at $4.97 and 700 shares in Yamana Gold with an average of $4.84 per share.💎🤲💎🤲

I'm an idiot so this is not financial advice but with the money printer going Brrrrrr I believe Gold miners will have a good year in 2021. _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ TLRY DD: 420.69% gainz I'll keep this short because my smooth brain cant make long posts. 

TLRY is going to the moon. Today it closed at $63.91 and is now sitting at $76.41 after hours as I write this. The highest call option for Friday the 12th is $65. There are a total of 30,555 option contracts listed in the option chain. If TLRY closes above $65 on Friday, I think there will be a lot of buying pressure. Also, the latest short interest report from 1/29 listed a short interest of 51% of the float. Perhaps many of those shorts were closed today during the massive trading volume today. Perhaps they werent. 

TLRY also was granted clearance to import and distribute their products in the UK this week. Last week they were given the first (and only) clearance to sell their medical cannabis products in portugal. Looking at the news articles, it seems they are also selling in Spain and Germany.

No sources listed since you shouldnt take my smooth brain word for it. 

My positions: 15 shares of Tilray bought at $36 and 27 shares of Apharia bought at $15.87

The [U.S. Department of Commerce just determined](https://www.accesswire.com/628789/US-Department-of-Commerce-Issues-Final-Affirmative-Countervailing-Duty-Determinations-on-Phosphate-Fertilizer-Imports-from-Morocco-and-Russia) that phosphate fertilizer imports from Morocco and Russia, major players in the phosphate fertilizer arena, are unfairly subsidized, with subsidy rates of (a) 19.97 percent for Moroccan producer OCP (b) 9.19 percent and 47.05 percent for Russian producers PhosAgro and EuroChem, respectively, and a rate of 17.2 percent for all other producers/exporters. The U.S. International Trade Commission has a concurrent investigation to determine whether Moroccan and Russian phosphate fertilizer imports materially injure the U.S. phosphate fertilizer industry, with a final ruling is expected by mid-March. If the ITC's ruling is affirmative, then Commerce will issue countervailing duty orders, which will remain in place for at least five years. At a time when supply chains are fragmented and food prices are quietly inflating (see below), the U.S. is protecting its own.

Food price inflation may still largely be unnoticeable in the grocery store, but there are signs elsewhere. Look at the 1year charts for:

Currently Tilray and Aphria are being mispriced by the market assuming a deal goes through. I see the deal as very likely to happen. The conversion rate for Aphria shares into Tilray shares is 0.8381 which means for every Aphria share you own you get .8381 shares of Tilray. Right now, Tilray is trading around $63 per share. This means that theoretically Aphria should be worth around $52 at the close of the deal. Currently Aphria is trading at a 50% discount. Is the market assuming the deal won’t go through? Is Tilray only going up because of a short squeeze? Seems like a good opportunity for a pair trade at this crazy discount.

The deal is expected to close around March/April

**DOES EVERY SINGLE POST HAVE TO BE A SHITPOST ABOUT APES BAGHOLDING FUCKING $GME AND OTHER NEWFAG STUFF TO GET ANY ATTENTION?**

**YES, THE MARKET CAP IS OVER 1B, STOP CHECKING RETARDED WEBSITES AND, IN DOUBT, CALCULATE IT YOURSELVES** [**https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/trxc?ltr=1**](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/trxc?ltr=1)

**TL;DR:**

**The rocket is taking off. Company good, system good, money not much. Competitor much money. Company promising. Shares cheap cheap, tendies lots. Shares is the play.**

today I want to bring $TRXC to your attention. I know you already know this stock, but bear with me. It has just crossed 1B market cap in a pretty awesome rally that started only a couple days ago, and it has grown over +46% today at the time of writing this DD.

But... who are $TRXC, you may ask?

TransEnterix build the devices... no, fuck this, the BATTLESTATIONS for surgeons to operate with the minimally invasive procedure known as laparoscopy ([https://www.healthline.com/health/laparoscopy#:\~:text=Laparoscopy%2C%20also%20known%20as%20diagnostic,look%20at%20the%20abdominal%20organs](https://www.healthline.com/health/laparoscopy#:~:text=Laparoscopy%2C%20also%20known%20as%20diagnostic,look%20at%20the%20abdominal%20organs).). Their system is called SENHANCE. Essentially, a robotic device pokes some holes in your tummy and, without opening you up for good, some little arms with tools, cameras, light... are introduced in your poor unfit office body to fix whatever is broken. Afterwards, the holes are stitched together and you can recover quickly and with fewer marks.

OK, OK, you may say, "why should this shit interest me? Does this not exist already? How do they do it?". I am glad you ask! This does exist, yes, and the industry standard is the well-known Da Vinci surgical system ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Da\_Vinci\_Surgical\_System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Da_Vinci_Surgical_System)) by Intuitive Surgical ($ISRG). So what the fuck is interesting about $TRXC? A couple things:

\- Senhance is a more modern system, with haptic feedback and even fucking eye tracking for camera control. SAUCES:

[https://www.massdevice.com/transenterix-bets-haptics-senhance-robot-assisted-surgery-device/](https://www.massdevice.com/transenterix-bets-haptics-senhance-robot-assisted-surgery-device/)

The concept is that the surgeon and the machine FUSE INTO ONE, becoming, you know, a Robocop or something like that.

\- TransEnterix bets for AI-POWERED MACHINE VISION to, for example, make the system's camera automatically follow the tools being used and this beast already has THE CE SIGN FOR COMMERCIALIZATION IN EUROPE AND FDA CLEARANCE. SAUCES:

\- They have started training surgeons in Japan to conquer their market:

[https://www.biospace.com/article/releases/transenterix-announces-establishment-of-japanese-training-center-for-senhance-surgical-system/](https://www.biospace.com/article/releases/transenterix-announces-establishment-of-japanese-training-center-for-senhance-surgical-system/)

\- And know the boring fundamentals:

Market Cap 1.182B (at the moment of typing this)

Public float 136.01M

Shares outstanding 176M

You can forget about P/E but LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT ITS COMPETITOR, $ISRG:

Market cap 91.62B

Public float 116.49M

Shares outstanding: 117.56M

So while the shares outstanding and the float are admittedly larger for $TRXC, they are still extremely undervalued if they are to be compared with their competitor which is trading, at the moment, at $788 per share. Of course, of course, it's a small company and establishing new surgical standards is complicated but, to me, they look like a steal EVEN AT THE CURRENT PRICE. And... wanna see how much they were in the past?

[Oh yes, they were worth a couple dollars more...](https://preview.redd.it/h8spk6lbnpg61.png?width=1667&format=png&auto=webp&s=ea84da4efc9f9d94e6650c9ee908dfa2706401e1)

I might have forgotten something or might have gotten something wrong because, needless to say,

EDIT3: I don't have time to write too much about it right now (this already ate up my fun time today), but their management is also pretty good:

[https://transenterix.com/about/our-management-team](https://transenterix.com/about/our-management-team)

Might write something on them in the following days.

EDIT4: I did find more fun time. Some doctors in Germany wrote a paper on Senhance, testing its feasibility, and compared it to Da Vinci:

[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11701-019-00980-9](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11701-019-00980-9)

The comparison with Da Vinci points out the reduced cost of using Senhance:

>\[..\] the ability to utilize conventional laparoscopic 5- and 10-mm trocars stands out in comparison to the da Vinci® robotic system which incorporates its own 8- and 12-mm ports \[[27](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11701-019-00980-9#ref-CR27)\]. Since fully reusable instruments are used by this surgical robotic system, an advantage regarding cost efficacy is expected when compared to the da Vinci® system. Excluding the acquisition costs of the Senhance™ Surgical Robotic System, the robot-specific cost per case at our department was 800 Euros, covering the expenses for drapes, instruments and maintenance according to a flat rate-based service contract. This comes in contrast to costs as high as 1700 Euros for drapes and instruments with da Vinci® robotic system while excluding maintenance and acquisition costs.

TL; DR: excluding maintenance and acquisition costs, each operation using Da Vinci ($ISRG) costs more than DOUBLE what it costs using Senhance ($TRXC).

And another paper:

[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11701-019-01000-6](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11701-019-01000-6)

This paper is not accessible for free, so let me just copy the conclusions for you autists to salivate:

>Our experience with diferent types of robotic surgeries allows us to state that the Senhance® robotic system is feasible and safe for general surgery, gynecology, and urology, and a wider implementation of this system worldwide is simply **a question of time**.

EDIT5: VIRTUAL INVESTOR DAY ON FEB 23. [https://ir.transenterix.com/events-and-presentations](https://ir.transenterix.com/events-and-presentations)

EDIT6: Article from investorplace [https://investorplace.com/2021/02/trxc-stock-will-do-well-over-time-now-that-it-has-enough-capital-to-survive/](https://investorplace.com/2021/02/trxc-stock-will-do-well-over-time-now-that-it-has-enough-capital-to-survive/)

>With $90 million in the bank, TransEnterix can last at least eight quarters at this rate. However, the truth is the company is likely to continue to raise capital, especially as its stock price rises. Therefore I don’t think that TransEnterix will run out of cash to fund its operations.

EDIT7: To complete this DD a little bit: "Camisa, why do you only say good things about this company? Why are they so cheap and how come their value has changed so dramatically over time?". OF COURSE there are downsides to the company. For example, how do you explain that they have been around so long and only have systems in 11 hospitals? Well, that's the thing: they haven't sold so many thus far. But this is also the reason why they have been forced to add functionality to become competitive.

I've been a longtime lurker on this sub since it was <1m degenerates, finally clicked the join button around Dec/Jan. It's great to see many new redditors take an interest in WSB, but for the love of Elon Musk, **READ THE POSTING GUIDELINES AND STOP MAKING THINGS UP!!!**

There is a case for GME, given the new CEO/CTO, console cycle, and massive short interest/short position (even at the real 42-43% SI and 21m SP). Those are factual events and numbers. What isn't the case are bagholders who have less of an understanding of the stock market than u/1r0nyman. It's one thing to hype up GME as a resurgent mecca in retail. It's another thing to **not understand how certain metrics are calculated, when/how data is reported, and blatantly make up numbers** because it fits a delusional reality where GME is going to be $10000/share. I'm not saying GME isn't ripe for another squeeze, but be reasonable. Think about what certain share prices mean and the odds it could ever reach such a height.

# Let me put it into context:

With that being said, I present you with the following:


I’m a fan of DFV the man, but I’m more interested in really **really** deep fucking value.  This will likely be a long post, but I think you’ll find value in it if you can follow along (see what I did there?).  


For those of you kids who can’t read good, I’ll put the **TLDR** right here at the top:  KT Corp ($KT) is so undervalued it’s almost fucking embarrassing.   When I say undervalued, I don’t mean by a little bit… I mean if this thing doubled it would still be a good value.  At the time of my writing this, KT is trading at $10.62.  **A realistic price target, if the market were to properly value this company, is ~$30.00**  I’ll go in depth as to why as we continue through this story, but the long and short of it is the Tangible Book Value of KT Corporation is $19.66/share.  What does that mean?  It means if KT declared bankruptcy tomorrow, was forced to sell off all of its tangible assets and pay back its debt, the remaining money to be returned to shareholders would be $19.66/share.  This does not take into consideration intangible assets – which have real value (in the $BILLIONS), but are harder to assess.  Again, it’s trading at $10.62 as of this writing (a price/tangible book value of only 0.54).  Value investors typically look for stocks trading at <3.0 price/TBV.  Deep value would be <1.0.  KT is trading at 0.54, and a price/book ratio of 0.42!  


Shares are cheap, options are cheap.  Do what you will – hell, sell it short if you want – but I like shares and calls.


**KT CORPORATE PROFILE**

KT Corporation (formerly Korea Telecom) is a South Korean integrated telecom conglomerate which was founded in 1885 – but realistically in 1981 in a more noticeable form – with business operations sprinkled throughout Asia, Africa, USA & Poland.  KT is South Korea’s first telecom company and dominates Korean market share in many of the spaces in which they compete:


**Line of Business** | **% of Korean Market Share**
:--|--:
Mobile Services | 31.4%
Fixed-line local telephone & VoIP | 64.9%
Broadband Internet Access | 40.9%
Pay TV Services | 31.6%


As a conglomerate, KT has their hands in a number of diversified pots.

**Products & Services** | **% of Total Revenue**
:--|--:
Mobile Services (incl. 5G) | 27.3%
Fixed-line (incl. VoIP, broadband, data comm.) | 19.5%
Media & Content | 10.1%
Financial Services (incl. credit card solutions) | 14.6%
Other (incl. IT, network services, real estate development) | 11.6%
Sale of goods (primarily mobile handsets) | 16.8%

KT has ~30% institutional ownership, with BlackRock being a large buyer in Q4 2020.  KT has also filed paperwork for a massive share repurchase program.  For what it’s worth in this day and age, the short % of shares outstanding is a measly 0.09%.  No one is going short on this thing at its current price.  You’d literally have to be insane to short it – it’d be like picking up pennies in front of a steamroller.  


**FINANCIAL METRICS & PEER COMPARISONS**

KT’s balance sheet is rock solid.  While it may not have the booming high growth of clean tech or cannabis, it is still growing and maybe more importantly, doing so profitably.  I touched on the tangible book value in the TLDR above, but this cannot be understated.  If you were to liquidate the company entirely, shareholders would receive $20-30 per share after the debt had been repaid.  I have highlighted some comparison ratios in the images below to show the truly disgusting undervaluation of KT.  


Compared to US-based telecom services index peers:

https://i.imgur.com/iOmE5mI.jpeg


Using a comp multiple for valuation based on these index comps gives the following implied value per share for KT ranging from $26.33 - $109.88 (unrealistic top end):

https://i.imgur.com/0hYg7Zy.jpeg


Compared to industry peers/comps:

https://i.imgur.com/lT8uPvh.jpeg


The following comparison is really the tale of the tape.  When we look at tangible book value, we see that all of the peers are trading above the tangible book value.  This is obvious, given the share price should exceed the liquidation value.  But we see the opposite being true for KT.  Again, **it is trading at HALF of its tangible book value.**  You could theoretically buy up all of the existing shares, liquidate the company, and double your money.  This is what I mean by real **deep fucking value.**

https://i.imgur.com/vGaVp9b.jpeg


Not that we put much weight in them around here, but all of the analysts are bullish on KT as well, with median upside of 33%.

Everyone looks for the **TLDR** at the bottom (I put it at the top of the post), but here it is:

Massively undervalued, $30/share realistic price target, it's trading at half of its tangible book value - meaning you could theoretically buy up all of the shares, liquidate the company's tangible assets, pay back the debt and be left with 2x your money and still have all of the intangible assets.

Screw the hype, I just LOVE these stocks. _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ WKHS USPS contract BLUF: I am long WKHS and believe American-made EV should be the new USPS mail truck. Long time commenter, first time DD’er; and I am not sorry about my lack of emoji inclusion in this DD. This is for pure autistinal personnel.

This is my take on a lot of DD going around WKHS. This is NOT an explanation of a possible short squeeze or how we will ‘stick to the HFs’. Fuck that I’m just trying to pass along my ideas and share them with y’all to get rich; if you like them great! If you don’t, great, but also fuck. This is also not technical analysis. I can make another post with my cup and handle patterns and bull flags showing up everyday indicating bullish trends but I really believe that you cannot use TA to predict the USPS. Sources for technicals are at the bottom.

WKHS price in the short term is almost entirely dependent on the USPS contract. They (the USPS) have been pushing back and pushing back the deadline to make the announcement on who gets USPS’s $6bb contract and hopefully we are approaching the finish line based off a board of governor’s meeting that occurred this week. Publicly there is no break-out candidate but WKHS is one of three, but most likely one of two remaining companies to replace the USPS fleet (~165,000 vehicles). The other finalist, Oshkosh, is teaming up with Ford, but their submission is still an ICE which does NOT meet the request and intent of the president’s Zero-Emission initiative. Let’s pause and talk about Biden and the USPS for a second and I’ll put it in bullet form so you morons skip to this part immediately:
    -Biden wants to electrify the entire US government fleet
    -Biden wants to the fleet to be 100% AMERICAN made vehicles
    -F is not 100% american made (something like only 64%, and even less for their future EV)
    -OSK/F’s submission is an ICE (they are planning EV but it was not their submission to the USPS contract bid)
    -WKHS is 100% manufactured in the USA
    -WKHS specializes in EV delivery vehicles and already has partnerships with all major delivery players
    -WKHS has patents and improvements to ‘last-mile’ delivery

But even with all that info, some may still push for an OSK/F vehicle since they already have solid partnerships with the federal government. Let’s talk about that: OSK has a relationship with the military to make Humvee’s and other huge gas guzzling trucks for military purposes. But this relationship is with the federal govt and will not influence the USPS decision. The USPS is an independent agency under the executive branch of the government. Who is in charge of that branch? Exactly. (That is why Trump had so much influence over the last 4 years in the USPS and vote-by-mail, but not the time for this discussion). The USPS is also a for-profit agency AND RECEIVES NO DIRECT TAXPAYER FUNDING, but continues to operate at a loss. The USPS spent $706.2mm maintaining their fleet of shitty ICE clunkers in FY2019.

Short of Elon Musk going out and mailing his entire fortune in nickels to the ISS via First Class Mail, what better way to reduce cost and increasing revenue than by going completely EV. The USPS MUST reduce cost and improve technology chain to remain competitive:
    -ICE repair and maintenance cost per mile ~$0.028
    -EV repair and maintenance cost per mile ~$0.012
    -Total savings per vehicle for lifetime by using EV: ~$4600

The USPS is run by a board of governors who in turn elect a Postmaster General. They operate like any board of directors and must answer to deficits and losses. It is imperative for the USPS to remain up to date on emerging technologies to reduce cost of delivery. Which brings us to another point: Last Mile Delivery.

Last Mile Delivery accounts for more than 53% of total shipping cost. Last mile delivery is the distribution center to your doorstep (literally where USPS operates). It costs $10.10 to deliver a package to your door, but USPS is charging $8.08. So they are already operating a loss. Why is this so expensive?
1) Lower average speed + more time on the road = fewer mpg
2) More stops leads to more idling and more downtime
3) My neighborhood mailman always parks her truck at the bottom of the hill and hikes up “to get exercise” = way more time for delivery


The first two of these issues are solved with WKHS. WKHS EV will reduce mpg cost (duh) but their final mile drone delivery and automated solutions will reduce the need for more stops and increase productivity chain. Seriously, look up the Workhorse Horsefly. The third issue I will not argue and fully support her getting in better shape.

With all this being said it’s obvious that I feel that WKHS is the obvious choice, but who knows what the board of governors is thinking. Below are the 4 scenarios for end game that a user came up with on tradingview but they are pretty standard:

Scenario One: 40% chance: WKHS earns the entire contract. Someone else did the math of the fair stock price after adjusting for the additional billions of dollars WKHS would have from winning the contract and they came out with $172 per share right after the contract was announced.

Scenario Two: 30% change: The contract is split up between Oskosh and WorkHorse. In the initial documentation before Biden's 100% green energy plans, the USPS wanted 75% electric 25% gas vehicles so it is possible workhorse gets 75% and Oskosh gets 25%. Others on the internet claim that it will be all or nothing but if you check the actual agreement it gives room for a split which the government does all the time. Even with only 10% of the contract awarded to WKHS you can expect to see the stock break past $60 the very next day.

Scenario Three: 20% chance: They can’t come to a decision and push it back until next quarter. This has happened already two times. They were first supposed to decide this summer, but they pushed it back to December. In December they failed again and pushed it back to latest March 31st. If this happens, the pullback to about $20 is super likely or at least holding the lower fibonacci retracement.

Scenario Four: 10% chance: OSK wins the contract. Oskosh is an awesome company, they have a very positive relationship with the government selling us Humvees for the military. They are respected and reliable, however they submitted a fossil fuel powered prototype and due to contract law can't just resubmit something else at the last minute. Especially with Biden wanting to look like he can get shit done AND after having made a statement about electrifying the US Fleet it looks insanely unlikely that OSK gets the entire bid, but if this happens, the only support that won't get destroyed the very next day is at the $16 level.

TLDR: WKHS should win the USPS contract and their short term viability relies on it.

My positions: 600 shares at $34 cost basis, $32C LEAPs 1/2022, $32C’s at 2/12, 2/19, 3/19
Total position is worth around 30,000 right now and about 40% of my single-registered.

Fidelity owned 9.3 million shares as of dec 31. As of Jan 29, that number is 87. They unloaded their stake in January, stop downvoting everything that doesn’t conform to your hivemind.

Edit 3: People really coming thru and downvoting comments unrelated to gme because I posted a negative article about their messiah 

Edit 4: posting a link to an SEC file WHICH YOU CLEARLY DID NOT READ does not prove Fidelity did not sell. If you did a little actual thinking, you could go to the sec website and see that they in fact sell. Also the file you posted was not related to an internal transfer like you think. 

ORIGINAL POST: 
During January, Fidelity Investments sold its entire stake in GameStop, amounting to 9.3 million shares or 13% of the company, for massive gains. As of January 29, they now own 87 shares. Last I checked, Fidelity is no more a friend to you or me than Melvin Capital. 

It’s time to realize that this wasn’t wsb vs Wall st and move on with your lives. There was a massive short squeeze, with big money on either raise, and smart money cashed out at the top. Anyone who still has the stock isn’t ‘holding the line’, just the bag. 

This sub turned into a cult. I want to see big plays and big ‘Guhs’, not a million posts about holding the line on a company that hasn’t turned a profit since 2018. This GME shit has ruined this sub, and I honestly think all these new users are going to be prime for pump and dump scams on random shit stocks, which really worries me in terms of this sub actually surviving. 

If you invested at the top in GME, I am sorry foe you and sorry that you got caught up in the mania. But some free advice: the second you get emotional about investing, you’ve lost. If you invest more money than you can afford to lose, you’re not going to be able to think rationally or objectively about your investment, and will
Inevitably get plowed. Ditto for this fake crusade against Wall Street (which I’m convinced is cover for people to dump their shares on unsuspecting idiots).

**Fidelity Cashes In Most of GameStop Stake**

2/10/21, 1:07 PM
Fidelity Investments sold nearly all of its positions in GameStop Corp. last month, just as shares of the videogame retailer were surging.

Fidelity's GameStop stake dropped to 87 shares on Jan. 29 from 9.3 million shares, or 13% of the company, on Dec. 31, according to securities filings. The sales ended Fidelity's run as the volatile stock's largest shareholder.

I’m assuming this was on the 28th of Jan when RH ceased allowing buys. This would seem to be coordinate in a since that RH blocks the retail buyers and Fidelity pushes the shorts to cover at the lower...

TLDR: Uhh yeah...

I cant stress enough the opportunities being LOST for real people, millions of people ON THIS SUB because a few bored cunts want to make this GME shit into something it's not. Even worse is that the real answer to the thing they claim to want is staring them right in the face.
I'll explain 

    Fuck your shitdeology. Almost every post on GME is barely concealed garbage class warfare shit and is complete denialism almost entirely without any self awareness or actual real evidence. Or trash memes. (KINDA LIKE MOST OF THE STUFF ON THE REST OF REDDIT) What a shock! 

Save WSB please its been completely trashed for a month now. I remember when we would've been seeing dozens of posts about all the ERs going on. Instead its this garbage ideology shit masked as GME love. I made 100k off GME. Great. but if you think it was ever truly about beating hedgefunds you're seriously retarded. I only cared about hedgefunds involved because of the effect it had on the price and the early gamma squeeze that got it moving so rapidly. 

We've got 7 million people who don't know a goddamn thing about economics or finance and only care about those subjects now because they've tricked each other by Circle jerking about how this GME shit is somehow a revolution. 

If you care about that shit. (Which I dont) Then NO, GME isnt a revolution you fucking retards GME was just a single example about how decentralized access to the mechanisms of finance can create a new model for opportunity to ANYBODY regardless of origin that can elevate millions of peoples in this world's level of financial security and freedom.

 And that CAN happen. It can happen if.... if... IF you retards would stop being so self absorbed and in denial about GME and instead learn about the economics, the fundamentals, the financial institutions, instruments etc of how this shit works you could have your actual "revolution" your actual elevation of millions of people accessing "rapid" (but uneven) financial growth. 

Instead you just chant memes and pretend you're part of a cause by posting crap about HODL or whatever. You want to be long on GME? Hope the price falls to 20 or lower before earnings and YOLO that shit. (I will) But stop using blatant denialism to ruin a sub and financially ruin yourselves because you're literally just giving money to the hedgefunds that you claim to hate. If you care about poor people getting rich it doesnt require them beating "the rich". Melvin shitron shitadel, they're all just a massive drop in the bucket and killing them is just for your young egos it's not even a single bloodstain on the tapestry of wealth inequality or whatever shit you're worried about.

I’m back as my prediction has been correct so far, and I only expect this trend to continue. Up 300% so far.  It is still incredibly EARLY for reasons I will explain.  



**RITE AID (RAD)**

Okay I know, your app is showing you it was .50 a year ago and you’re saying fuck idk about this one, it looks like I missed it.  It’s okay though, robbingyouhood is just lying again.  The truth is that rite aid had a 1:20 **reverse stock split** artificially X 20 the price.

**WHAT DOES THIS MEAN**

It means we can assume two things, rite aid has only doubled in price since its mediocre deal with Walgreens fell through.  

In 2016 Rite Aid had 4561 stores with a stock price of 160~ (adjusted for split) and a market cap of 8 billion dollars.  

In 2020 Rite Aid has 2500 stores with a stock price of 25~ and a market cap of 1.5 billion.

Yet if we look here https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/RAD/rite-aid/revenue

Rite aid revenue has actually INCREASED over the past five years and is at 75% of its highest point.  


They have trimmed the fat and beat earnings the last three quarters.


**MORE PROMISING NUMBERS**

https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/RAD/financials/annual/balance-sheet

Rite aid has a pretty optimistic balance sheet for a company that has been rebranding and restructuring.  Notably we can see they are sitting on 6 Billion in assets and are seeing 21 Billion Revenue with 12% growth this past quarter (over 25% this year)

Rite aid is becoming closer and closer to becoming consistently profitable once again as they are able to take advantage of coronavirus tax relief.  They are seeing increased foot traffic in their pharmacy and front end leading to this huge growth.  

Walgreens has 30x the market cap and 4x the revenue while CVS has 70x the market cap and 10x the revenue.  Neither are seeing the growth that rite aid is.  


**WHAT DO I DO**

I am very bullish on rite aid.  I am still holding shares and have adjusted my calls to 3-19 $30 and 4-16 $35 a handful of 2022 40$ as well.  

I have a price target or 50$ which I think is attainable by April. 

Tl;dr: Rite aid was shorted to shit and saved itself with a 1:20 reverse split.  As a result it’s STILL fundamentally undervalued.  Read last paragraph for plays.  

My earlier posts were earlier warnings but I’m yoloing today I think it’ll start to run up again as vaccine distribution ramps up._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Could Psychedelics (PSYK) be the next weed?  

Marijuana made so much money for those who got in very early. It was originally presented as a medical product, but when regions started to legalize it, it blew up.

Now there's a new ETF dealing in psychedelics (PSYK) that deals in a handful of companies focused on research for the application of psychedelics to treat mental health and other medical issues.

As mental health becomes an increasingly important part of medical research, and as countries around the world continue to lower regulation around the use of various 'narcotics' could this stock have the potential of blowing up?

I am thinking of investing, I just wanted to see what others think?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Why APHA is an Alpha Trade in the Short and Long-run (Actual DD) Tl;dr: I'm willing to bet all of you degenerates smoke weed and drive to your wife's boyfriend's house every Saturday night. Then, the munchies kick in full force and you got to a Wendy's parking lot and jack off to a video of your wife flipping you off while riding a dong as least eight times longer than your 5 dollar inch long. There is a fucking bubble and you should get in. And it's a good long-term investment, so you should get in (none of this is financial advice, this is just me talking to myself in Reddit after taking anti-depressants from holding Gamestop).

&#x200B;

**Reason 1:** Everyone's a bull. The pigs and bears are dead because there's more money than what financial institutions know what to do with.

Remember SPY puts? Remember printer goes brrrrrr? Remember how monetary policy produced some of the greatest loss porn we've ever seen. Gay bears is kill and the government has proven that they will probably prop up the financial system even if bubonic plague 2.0 happens. That money is still floating around with the Fed's finger on the trigger prepared to smack the equity markets back up. That money was invested into stocks like TSLA (which is the most beautiful and terrifying bubble I've seen in my life). That money will also make weed stocks as high as a kite. Discounted cash flows, betas, stock/bond conflicts, and all that other stuff is irrelevant. Monetary policy is fundamental and will always save those who have money.

This is the new reality we live with. Like it or buy some guns, ammunition, and a lifetime worth of soylent and beyond meat and start your own 1 person country in the backass of nowhere.

There will be a bubble and it will pop. Do not be concerned about the pop until it appears imminent. And even if it does, I would still consider holding it for a delicious long play.

**Reason 2:** APHA's balance sheet is robust. Doesn't show any signs of collapsing financially. Longevity in a new industry is golden.

[https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/apha/financials](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/apha/financials)

Instead of getting high on their own supply when their stock soared as high as a kite, the comedown was harsh. But instead of getting rekt, they have been expanding rapidly regardless. Their sales have increased 142.34% in 2017, 80.62% in 2018, **542.28%** in 2019, and 128.73% in 2020. And considering that everyone's spending their stimulus money smoking weed and buying Gamestop, I do not see this trend stopping at any point. I've been to my local weed shop in CA and it's fucking packed every time I go in both pick ups and lines. I have to wait at least 45 minutes to get in.

Even though the net income is concerning (it usually is for companies that grow rapidly due to the costs of expanding like a chad), the firm has a really large pillow to fall on. To be clear, for a company to be totally dead in the water, its equity (the difference between its assets and liabilities) goes to zero. APHA has 2.5 billion in assets and .7125 mil in liabilities. This is perhaps one of the reasons it gobbled up Tilray-- APHA recognizes it can increase its market share in an inevitable market place. This means that the company can continue its rapid expansion without worrying about defaulting. For reference, Amazon could afford to lose hundreds of millions of dollars from 2012-2015 because it has the assets to afford rapid expansion. We are looking at a potential hundred billion dollar company here as the marijuana industry consolidates into a few major players. APHA is likely to be one of those, as it has the durability and fundamentals to survive years of consecutive negative net income. APHA's largest expenses are "unusual expenses," implying that they are really swinging for the fences with many one-time expansive purchases. 

**Reason 3:** Because of BLM and a decade of rising sentiment against the war on drugs, enforcing weed possession and sales laws are politically dangerous.

Yup. Nixon's law and order paradigm is falling out of the sky. Busting into people's apartments for a gram of weed and sentencing the occupants to 9 years in prison is not too popular. Even if marijuana legalization doesn't happen this or next or whatever, the tide has overwhelming turned against a "tough on crime" attitude toward non-violent drug use. This means that across the United States (and likely the world over the next decade or so), **weed will be effectively legal** over time even if it's not truly legal.

Position: 40 shares of APHA high as a motherfucking kite._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ I mean, look at these hands! _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Why CGC is the best choice for you if you want to join Weed Gang Listen, retards, I can try to look smart, copy-paste dozens of articles you won't even click, but I won't, because I'm as retarded as you're and I can't read. I know that lots of you were spending money on weed long before the Weed Gang movement has started but it's time when you can buy some weed and get some tendies for it. Sounds cool isn't it? But many of you, esplecially the ones who got burned on GME, don't know which stock to gamble right now because many of them are already 100-200% up. My best advice for you right now is to go balls deep in Canopy Growth Corp (CGC). It's only 10% up since last week and still wasn't affected by WSB autists. [Yesterday they announced that their revenue is up 23% over the same quarter last year](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cannabis-giant-canopy-growth-surges-12-on-new-profitability-outlook-and-us-legalization-hopes-230939563.html) and their business looks very good and as soon as the legalization thing gets covered, CGC will skyrocket even without this hype so it's an actual long-term investment. And since everyone is buying weed stocks it's a much more attractive pick for you right now.

See you on the next shareholder meeting_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Even the smallest shareholder can change the course of the future - PART 2 _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Amazon Doubles Down on Grocery Amazon is aggressively investing in the retail grocery business with the goal of operating 2,000 retail stores in the US blended between Whole Foods and Amazon Fresh. And so far they are killing it!

There are currently 500 Whole Foods stores and 8 Amazon Fresh stores in the US. Over 30 Whole Foods and 27 Amazon Fresh stores are currently in development.

Amazon recently opened the doors to its newest Amazon Fresh in Northridge, California. While the store marks the banner’s third location in SoCal (joining [Woodland Hills](https://www.winsightgrocerybusiness.com/retailers/how-amazon-fresh-won-my-business) and [Irvine](https://www.winsightgrocerybusiness.com/retailers/will-amazon-fresh-crush-it-california)), dozens of additional stores in various stages of development are also underway in the area. According to Planned Grocery, additional SoCal stores are planned or under construction in Poway, Whittier, Fullerton, Long Beach, La Verne and Encino. Additionally, four locations in the Chicago area are slated to open soon.

“Amazon seems to be putting the pedal to the metal with its grocery expansion plans,” R-5 Capital Analyst Scott Mushkin wrote. “In our view, it is hard not to see the recent partnership between Amazon and SpartanNash as a sign that Amazon intends to grow its store fleet rapidly over the next few years,” Mushkin said. According to the 2021 dunnhumby Retailer Preference Index, Amazon eclipsed top grocery retailers H-E-B and Trader Joe’s due to Speed, Digital and strong Price and Quality.

“H-E-B and Trader Joe’s are terrific brands, yet Amazon’s unmatched convenience is addictive,” wrote Ms. Goller. “The dunnhumby stats prove consumers crave prompt home delivery, a trend that will outlast the pandemic. Even when life resumes, Just Walk Out technology at Amazon Go and rivals’ stores will set new brick-and-mortar standards for convenience, ease and time savings. Also, I expect Whole Foods and Amazon Fresh will continue to expand nationwide when the time is right. Amazon’s hungry to win and its grocery party is just getting started.”

During United Natural Foods' recent earnings call, CEO Steven Spinner expects to renew its Whole Foods contract in early 2021. From their recent 10K filling, "We have been the primary distributor to Whole Foods Market for more than twenty years. Under the terms of our agreement with Whole Foods Market, we serve as the primary distributor to Whole Foods Market in all of its regions in the United States. Our agreement with Whole Foods Market expires on September 28, 2025. Whole Foods Market is our only customer that represented more than 10% of total net sales in fiscal 2020." Whole Foods accounted for approximately 18% of UNFI's net sales in fiscal 2020.

During Amazon's recent earnings call, Dave Fildes, director of investor relations, said the Amazon Go Grocery format was “off to a good start,” adding there was “a lot of interest” in the technology behind it and Amazon Fresh grocery stores.

Given the investments Amazon has made in the grocery business and the significant positive response thus far favorably positions Amazon and other grocery suppliers such as United Natural Foods (UNFI).

&#x200B;

Today I want to talk about Virgin Galactic and the potential the company has. Space travel is vastly developing and together with the EV business this will be the future.

**Chamath** helped Virgin Galactic in the process to go public. Recently Cathie announced that she will create **a Space ETF**. ARKQ has been buying a lot of shares over the last few months. Recently ARKQ sold some shares, but I would consider it normal since the stock is up by 140% since September. I would assume ARKQ took some profits and reinvested them in other companies.

I would like to take a look at the business model of the company. Many "Bears" are saying that the business won't be profitable because of the high cost of the tickets. Estimates are that the price for one ticket will be around 250.000 dollars. So their customers would have to be millionaires in order to be able to pay for it. Only 1% of the population is a millionaire. So you would assume it won't be very profitable in the long run.

But let's take a look at the history of flying. In it's early years, flying was very expensive and only a luxury for the rich. Back in 1941, the cost to travel from Boston to Los Angeles was **$4539.24**. In 2015 this only costs **$480.89**. Source: [https://www.travelandleisure.com/airlines-airports/history-of-flight-costs](https://www.travelandleisure.com/airlines-airports/history-of-flight-costs)

Space travel might have a similar trend regarding the price of the tickets. Only the rich will be able to afford a ticket to space in the beginning but as technology improves, the business costs will be reduced.

But space travel is not their only catalyst. They are looking into supersonic flights. They made a deal with **Rolls-Royce** regarding this subject. Here's an article for those who are interested: [https://www.virgingalactic.com/articles/virgin-galactic-unveils-mach-3-aircraft-design-for-high-speed-travel-and-signs-memorandum-of-understanding-with-rolls-royce/](https://www.virgingalactic.com/articles/virgin-galactic-unveils-mach-3-aircraft-design-for-high-speed-travel-and-signs-memorandum-of-understanding-with-rolls-royce/)

I want to talk about the short interest. **The short percent of float is currently 71.95%**! In November the short percent reached its peak at 89.3%. Since then some shorts have been covering their positions as many catalysts are being released. But with a successful flight to space, the stock price might surge and more shorts might give up on their position. I just want to point you out, the stock price in November was $26.61. Currently the stock trades at $56.71. To be honest, they might be sweating right now. Source: [https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/SPCE/short-interest/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/SPCE/short-interest/)

Okay I will finish this DD with a list of **catalysts** which are coming:

\- This **Saturday** Virgin galactic will open the **flight window**. This does not mean they will fly the Saturday, but it will happen within the next few days. There was an unsuccessful flight back in December. But what some people might not understand, is the amount of safety procedures a company has to take. SpaceX for example are shooting up many rockets each year, but there are no passengers. So when a rocket explodes, many people would be fascinated by the explosion. But imagine if a rocket with 3 people exploded. That's why it is so much harder for Virgin Galactic to have a successful flight.

I live in Belgium and I was watching the news here. Back in December the news reported about the failed flight of Virgin Galactic. I didn't expect this at all. But imagine if they have a successful flight. The news would spread around the world.

\- After the successful flight, Richard Branson will go to space later this year. It was scheduled in Q1-Q2 of 2021, but it got pushed back due to the failed test in december.

\- They are expecting to have their first commercial space flight in 2021.

\- Cathie will launch her Space ETF.

I think this stock has a lot of potential and a successful flight will launch this stock. Virgin Galactic will literally bring us closer to the moon.

I come to you with news from a boomers favorite form of currency: gold. More specifically, a mining company, Yamana Gold. They have earnings tomorrow on the 11th, and based on their previous guidance, they are going to post very strong earnings. Although I hold shares (yeah yeah I know), options are dirt cheap with such low IV. I want to present a case for the company as I believe they have a great year ahead of them.

Now I know gold is down in the past few months, but it still remains as strong as its ever been, and Yamana Gold (ticker $AUY) has been absolutely benefiting from the high prices. With the Feds keeping lending rates low through 2023 and supporting this vision with monthly Treasury bond purchases, this can push down long-term yields. Add this onto the ongoing fiscal stimulus and a steadily increasing money supply, there are many reasons for investors to choose gold in the coming years.

On top of high gold/silver prices, Yamana is looking at a nice increase in production from their Canadian Malartic mine in 2021, and is expected to benefit from higher output at the newer Cerro Moro mine. Yamana is pushing to deeper underground levels at Cerro Moro, which will lead to improved yield and production potential. Yamana's management expects to [produce at least 1 million gold equivalent ounces](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/02/02/3-value-stocks-thatll-make-you-richer-in-february/) (GEO) in each of the next three years. 

With gold prices up significantly over the past five years, Yamana has also been able to [reduce its net debt](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/07/29/should-you-buy-gold-stocks-right-now.aspx) by over $1 billion, and increase their annual dividend 425% over 18 months. In a few more quarters at this 1 million GEO annual target, and it just might become net-cash positive.

Positions: 200 shares @ $4.92 and 2/19 $5C._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ DD: Cinemark ($CNK) – Clear Standout in “Moon Stock” Screen🚀🚀🚀 First time poster, longtime tard. GME was too beautiful to remain a passive reader. Sure, lob your “HF shill” comments (bring it retards) but then hear me out if you like $$$$ (…can’t be sure with half you guys…)

The perfect stock has been right in front of your eyes and it’s so obvious it hurts. AMC’s ugly sister, CNK, is strapped to an Elon Musk rocket and is just begging for someone to press the big shiny launch button.

This is a rare one-two punch where both the technical & fundamental pictures look great.

**Punchline Upfront:** CNK currently trades at $20. CNK has upside to $40. These are levels at which it traded only 18 months ago. In fact, CNK traded in a $10 range between $32 and $42 in 2019 with an average price of $37.80 

# Technical: The Ice Cream (The Tendie?)

OK… Why CNK? Simple: I ran a “Moon Screen” which looked for: 

1. **High Short Interest** (>20% of floatable shares outstanding)
2. **Cheap Stock** (Hasn’t Had A “GME moment”, low 1 year return, fundamentals etc.)
3. **Small company** with lower trading volume (both mean more upside)
4. **Liquid** (i.e. a lot) **call options** (fuck puts) to minimize trading costs (i.e. maximize tendies) 

and CNK got spit out as the clear standout. If this feels familiar, it’s because most of these criteria were based off GME before Cohen was announced to the board. That’s right: I simply want to acknowledge the salivating technical set up and it’s similarity to GME pre-orbit. 

# Fundamental: The Cherry on Top (The Tendie Sauce?)

COVID has changed the world in lasting, meaningful ways and CNK’s theatre footprint is uniquely positioned to benefit from these changes. Pent-up demand for out-of-home entertainment combined with a backlog of strong film content creates a strong backdrop for Cinemark.

&#x200B;

# Reason 1: Suburban + Lower-Income Tilt Will Outperform in Post-COVID World

* TL;DR: Suburban Footprint = Actually Really Fucking Good (For Many Reasons)

Cinemark’s theatre footprint is slated toward suburban locations. Don’t take my word for it, here is their COO/CFO Sean Gamble (really his name lol): “\[CNK\] tends to be more suburban, while \[AMC’s\] circuit tends to be a bit more metro.” **This is what gets me excited.** While we still don’t fully know the extent COVID had on people living in dense, urban areas like NYC, the preliminary read is that it has accelerated the move to the suburbs. This helps CNK for two reasons:

1. Suburban locations have lower rent
2. Suburban locations stand to benefit from higher demand based off people moving to the suburbs

Just think for a second. On average, suburbs have less fun shit to do. Although going to the movies might not sound that exciting in a city given all the great alternatives, going to the movies might be “the only game in town” in suburbia

In addition, Cinemark operates primarily in smaller cities and suburban areas, meaning lower-income where customers are more price-sensitive. Cinemark’s customer base also has a higher share of families than AMC/Regal. This also helps CNK:

1. More price sensitive customers => less ability to create a compelling movie experience at home => more likely to continue going to the theater

# Reason 2: Better Balance Sheet => Longer Runway to Weather “COVID Storm”

* TL;DR: Lots Money + Low Debt + Low Rent = I Can Wait Out COVID

Strong balance sheet (850mm in cash sitting there; low leverage of 2x-3x vs. AMC at 8.5x). 

Industry-leading Operations with FAT margins (23-26% domestic margins; 8.6% “fatter” (i.e. good, fat margin = fat tendie) than AMC)

Low rent obligations. New/updated theaters. Nice operational runway to weather the COVID storm.

# Reason 3: Boost From Dollar Weakness

25% of revs from Latin America. Huge FX headwind here if dollar depreciates (which many people think) 

&#x200B;

**Valuation/\*Nerd Shit\*:**

* Has traded historically at 6.5-8.5x fwd EBITDA. Conservatively, take low end of range due to sentiment around streaming killing box office sales despite still trading at 8.5x as recently as a few years ago 
* Full-year 2021 revs will be -50% but by 2022, revs should be back to 2019 (pre-COVID) levels. So, using 2022 lvls is the right forward base to value this thing.
* EBITDA was \~750mm in 2019. 50mm haircut for potential covid hiccups puts me at 700mm estimate for 2022 (again, the first “normal” year given 2021 is already off to shit start). Taking the low-end of the valuation multiple, 6.5x, gives me a price of $38.50 (after dividing by shares outstanding)

**Target Price: $38.50**

&#x200B;

**Afterthought – Takeout Upside:**

* Streaming service (AMZN, NFLX, DIS) bundling subscriptions with theatre access might serve as a competitive differentiator as the content wars get increasingly competitive as nearly a dozen streaming services compete for market share. Might snatching up a cinema on the cheap offer an edge via a differentiated experience tack on?
* Just as restaurants won’t go away despite everyone having a kitchen, theatres could still have a role, although a changed one that will have to become experience-first, movie-second
* As long as dates (esp. highschool !) and nights out still happen, having an extra avenue to watch movies besides your couch will still have some demand
* A physical footprint for AMZN to test VR and reinforce other e-commerce services

&#x200B;

**Notes/Links:**

**Sean Gamble** \- *Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer*

>"And in terms of our overlap, it really varies based on the market and just what you consider overlap based on distance. In general, it's pretty small, I would say, estimate less than 20%. You just consider our market shares, that can kind of show that it's only a small portion in. **We generally tend to be more suburban, while their circuit tends to be a bit more metro**. So it's a limited overlap."

Edit: Original YOLO post [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lg3qns/amd_105k_yolo/)_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $NVTA reeeeeeeee _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ For my Palantirians and Palantards PS: The post is meant to explain why we're down for the day (original purpose) and provide assurance for the poor newbs who don't know any better. Not calling for a DD. I say buy in for the short term (Calls) to capitalize on the uptrend to ER, then get out, and determine what you want to do next by the Lockup

&#x200B;

The drop hurts, I know. But understand that this dip is in reality, another buying opportunity that was initiated by a few things.

Firstly the most obvious one, the NASDAQ. It's plunging right now; down, -0.6 atm although it's slowly recuperating it's #'s; good job Sleepy Joe. Since the WSB hype left us during the initial blitz, we now follow the MKT beat for beat. So yeah, I wonder what would happen.

Secondly, you have to consider why people might consider selling. Although we can scream "to the moon" all day, in the short term, you'd have to acknowledge how much PLTR has jumped since the Thursday scare, even with the price tanking. Before the SOD, it was at $38, nearly a 20% jump up from 5 days ago. And even with the drop, we're in a very strong, Bullish uptrend. On top of that, we've had 5 ascending closes in a row, differed by pretty big figures, it can't keep doing this for forever. So although as a Long, the reasoning is beyond short sighted and retarded for literally a million reasons, you can at least see where they're at in the head.

Plus don't forget, we're still a top tier MM target and you know deep down they're licking their lips for ER. On top of that, don't forget about all the Retail Traders who are doing so also, but haven't cashed in. It's only Wednesday. ER is Pre-MKT Tuesday. That's a whole week to go through. Wdyt think is going to happen when people realize the beast that's soon to come as everyday passes? You believe we'll be below $30 EOW, with the inevitable hype, like those vegetable brained Bears keep preaching?

Hovering around $36 really isn't that bad, it's just back to where we were 2 days ago, that's still huge progress for a week's time. Longs, remain plush. Late bloomers, don't fret. The upward jump will recrudesce once more, back to tranquility lane.

So as we've all said before. Just hold on tight, buy up those dips and enjoy the ride as the blitz has yet to commence. This is just a minor Pullback, a road bump, in a drive up the mountain._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Teva Pharma Well, If anyone listened to my last post about ACB and bought some OTM FDs you'd be up a cool 500% if you sold this morning, so figured give this another shot.  

With 2.1billion in positive cash flow Teva has committed to making these changes by 2030 

Specifically, the company has committed by 2030 to:

* Reduce absolute Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 33% versus 2017 levels to support efforts to limit the global temperature increase to well below 2°C, aligning with the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement.
* Improve transparency of Scope 3 GHG emissions and increase engagement on climate issues with key suppliers throughout the value chain.
* Increase energy efficiency by 10% and the total proportion of energy purchased or generated from renewable sources to 50%.
* Reduce total water withdrawal by 10% in areas projected to be in water stress.
* Assess and mitigate the environmental impact of pharmaceutical ingredients used in operations.
* Reduce the overall mass of secondary and tertiary packaging materials per unit dose and increase the proportion of recycled and responsibly-sourced materials by 10%.
* Assess the environmental lifecycle impact of key products.
* Continue to minimize waste generated from operations and the environmental impact of its disposal.
* Meet existing AMR Industry Alliance commitments to minimize antimicrobial discharges from the supply chain.   

That sounds pretty fuckin green, aka one stock to own during the Biden presidency.

&#x200B;

Also lets look at some projections for next year

 2021 business outlook:

* Revenues are expected to be $16.4 - $16.8 billion (2020 actual results include \~$240 million in revenues from generic products in Japan divested on February 1, 2021, along with a manufacturing site)
* Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be $2.50 - $2.70
* Free cash flow is expected to be $2.0 - $2.3 billion

Someone wanna explain to me how a company projected to do 16 Billion plus in revenue still only have a market cap of 12 billion? Simple it's underpriced.

**EDIT --**  Probably shouldn't care about the people calling cap in the comments.. but nevertheless, here is a screenshot of when I opened the position -- [https://i.redd.it/ej4d8uwodog61.png](https://i.redd.it/ej4d8uwodog61.png)_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Ford Motors (F) DD **Overview**

Ford Motors is currently undervalued ($45B) after an underperforming Q4 but is taking the right steps to compete in the electric and autonomous vehicle markets going forward.

**Reasons**

* Ford is already in an upward trend the past 30 days. This week they just released news of their **$29 Billion** (with a 'B') investment into their electric and autonomous vehicles department  ([link](https://www.motortrend.com/news/ford-ev-investment-2025/)) surpassing that of General Motors.
* Ford now has it's first credible mass-market competition to Tesla in the [2021 Mustang Mach-E electric crossover SUV](https://www.motortrend.com/cars/ford/mustang-mach-e/) which goes on sale later this year.
* Ford is bringing the real 'merica to electric trucks (sorry Elon) with it's upcoming [F-150 full-size truck](https://www.motortrend.com/cars/ford/f-150/2021/2021-ford-f-150-first-look-review/) in mid-2022.
* Rivian, backed by Ford and Amazon, looking to IPO this year ([link](https://www.chicagobusiness.com/manufacturing/rivian-backed-amazon-and-ford-aims-ipo-year))
* Ford in the running to be Post Office's next delivery vehicle ([link](https://fordauthority.com/2020/12/ford-transit-in-running-to-become-post-offices-next-delivery-vehicle/))
* The **new Ford Bronco release date** is spring 2021. ([link](https://www.ford.com/bronco/))
* Tesla is in trouble with Chinese regulators and other companies are ready to take up some market share.
* Even if you don't buy options and are just a share investor, Ford Motors has a respectable 1.30 Dividend Yield.
* And if you don't believe me an actual (non-monkey) analyst has already said it would be going up to $14 ([link](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/ford-upgraded-to-buy-at-argus-with-a-price-target-that-matches-the-street-high-2021-02-09)).

**Speculation**

With Tesla leading the market in electric vehicles, America needs competition to take place. Who better than one of the oldest vehicle manufacturers? Ford knows trucks, which will be a big part of the upcoming electric market. How many times have you heard two bro's start arguing about trucks and inevitably one of them is always a Ford?!? The stock is ripe for the taking and if you want to get some tendies, you should get in now.

**TLDR**; Ford is 'merica. 'Merica needs electric trucks. Go buy Ford.

**Edit** Added post office update, added Rivian update, Bronco update_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ APHA vs TLRY Arbitrage * TLRY and APHA are merging.
* 1 Share of TLRY is bouncing around 60/share at the moment.
* 1 Share of APHA is about 28/share

When the merger completes the publicly announced ratio of the new company to the old is that current Tilray stockholders will retain exactly one share, while due to market cap+outstanding shares at the time of the merger, APHA shareholders will retain .83 shares per current share of APHA.

So, if current prices hold there is a HUGE gap here that must close. Either TLRY must come down, or APHA must rise. Based on current value of TLRY, APHA shares have an expected value of 49.8

Based on the current value of APHA, TLRY shares have an expected value of 33.5ish

OR, if for some reason the gap stays as large as it is, APHA shareholders will realize a 78% gain at the moment of the merger.

Positions:

APHA 35c Feb 12

APHA Shares

EDIT: Some of you are a little dense.  To be clear, if the results here are

1. TLRY falls to close gap
2. APHA Rises to close gap
3. APHA shareholders realize a large gain in value at time of merger.
4. TLRY RISES more than APHA 

The obvious play would be APHA. In all three situations you are either neutral or gaining.

EDIT2: There ARE, of course, other situations in which you get boned here.

The consensus here and in the market is that all the money to be made on Pfizer has been made. I disagree for a few reasons and am currently pumping money into this stock as much as I can. Before reading this, I want to state as clearly as possible I am not in any way a professional/financial advisor I am a 20-year-old mechanical engineering student the only proper education in this area is from yale open-source courses and from books like stocks for the long runs. I believe Pfizer will bottom out at a worst-case scenario of 32$ if I see 32$ I will yolo my portfolio into 3-month 40$ calls, but what I am hoping for is it does not recover until the next quarterly report in which case I will yolo my portfolio into five day or single day calls. Again, I cannot stress enough I am not a professional please do you own research before following me and also if u see a flaw in my theory please tell me. I also want to state that Pfizer has a market cap of 200 billion we do not have the buying power to in any way pump that I am not trying to generate hype around this, but it is 50% of my portfolio.

1 investing fundamentals. 

One of the most important ratios in investing is the price to earnings ratio. This fundamentally indicates if a stock is over or undervalued. In the book stocks for the long run which is high on yales economics reading list the author states that a p/e ratio of 16 or higher is overvalued currently the market average is 27 indicating a stock market crash is coming however Pfizer’s is currently twelve. As a dividend stock which it historically has been it would be undervalued based on pure economic theory. To give some examples of competitors p/e ratio Johnson Johnson=26 AstraZeneca= 26 moderna is not profitable. My point here is that Pfizer has one of the best prices to earnings ratio of any company on the market right now indicating it is undervalued. This also indicates in the event of a market crash Pfizer will be one of the best stocks to be holding.

2 currently in a large dip that Pfizer always recover well from

The Pfizer share price has tanked in the last few weeks as wall street decided that spending 2-3 billion developing  the COVID-19 vaccine to save the world was too much money to spend (typical fucking scum of wall street). As a historically consistent  dividend paying stock Pfizer is a well-liked stock by hedge funds and pensions these funds do not reward bad quarters and pulled out this has caused the price to dip over 10%. In the last few years this happened before in July Pfizer announced that it was planning on changing its business model all these funds pulled out and the share price dropped 8 dollars, from this and the fact that it is fundamentally undervalued I believe it wont drop more than 8 dollars. 

3 the vaccine revenue will actually take Pfizer to the moon. 

For all these hedge funds focusing on dividend stocks quarterly profit is all they care about Pfizer spent large and didn’t earn extra last quarter Pfizer is expecting at least 15 billion dollars in profit from the vaccine alone, when you add this to their typical earnings that is 65 billion expected earnings a 30% increase on their usual earnings , they will absolutely smash their last quarter performance, all the investing into the vaccine has been done now it is time for them to cash in. on top of this Pfizer has massively cut expenditure by splitting the company into two Pfizer and viatrus (I will address this at the end)

4 AstraZeneca vaccine might not work.

It does not work on the Brazilian or south African strain. 

5 professional opinions 

Every market pundit I can find is estimating that the share price hits 42 dollars this year, some estimating up to 69(nice) while I don’t always trust sources such as CNN money or market commentators in general what It is to me is a validation of my estimations and research.

Last year Pfizer announced they were changing their business model from a revenue to growth company meaning they offloaded essentially all non-patented drugs which provided consistent but low revenue this allows them to focus on developing new highly profitable drugs such as the COVID-19\_\_\_0 vaccine while these have high start-up costs of 2-3 billion Pfizer is worth 200 billion and can easily ride out the volatility of 1/5 investments not working when for example the Pfizer vaccine will net them 15 billion minimum (could be more if AstraZeneca fail) that is not all the investment will makes the miRNA technology means they can make a new vaccine in 2 months if needed, this technology will be ridiculously profitable. Typically, investors buy into companies with a growth business plan at wildly overvalued prices e.g., tesla p/e is 1700 because the prospect of future growth outweighs the lack of current earnings Pfizer is a company aiming for huge growth who are also one of the most fundamentally undervalued stonks on the market. 

Conclusion 

Pfizer share price is wildly undervalued the market will not take long to correct this when it bounces back it might rocket to the moon and I am strapped in for that moment but even if it doesn’t it will get a 15% gain; I believe that the dip is turning now . my plan is to do this. 

A hold the shares I have buy 3 month calls with 40% of my remaining portfolio.

B if I see 34 dollars put 10% of my remaining portfolio 3-month calls. 

C if I see 33 dollars put 30% of my remaining portfolio in 3-month calls. 

D if I then see 32 dollars yolo my life’s savings (10 times my portfolio) In 3-month calls. 

E if the share price is still below 40 dollars coming up to the next quarterly report, I will yolo in 5-day calls aiming for a 2 dollar gain per share (Pfizer has a huge market cap it will move slowly)

This is my opinion on Pfizer I am not in any way qualified to give financial advice  for honesty I am saying I have a position I Pfizer, but I do not believe it is conceivably possible for us to adjust the share price of a 200b dollar company . Please if I have missed something let me know before I yolo on this am I just retard_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ (2/10) Wednesday's Pre-Market Stock Movers & News #Good morning traders and investors of the r/wallstreetbets sub!

# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Wednesday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/10/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-february-10-2021.html)

*****

> # 1. Dow set to bounce after breaking a six-session win streak

> * U.S. stock futures rose Wednesday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average indicated up nearly 100 points. A late fade Tuesday resulted in the Dow and S&P 500 falling slightly from closing record highs and breaking six-session winning streaks. However, the Nasdaq managed to hold on to a modest advance and notching another record close.

> * On the economy, the government releases its look at January consumer prices at 8:30 a.m. ET, one hour before the opening bell on Wall Street. At 2 p.m. ET, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell speaks at an Economic Club of New York webinar, in an address focusing on the state of the American job market.

*****

> # 2. Coca-Cola, GM report better-than-expected Q4

> * Coca-Cola on Wednesday said the coronavirus pandemic is still hurting sales, but cost-cutting efforts helped it top analyst earnings estimates. Shares of the Dow component rose 2% in premarket trading. The beverage giant made 47 cents per share in the fourth-quarter. Net sales dropped 5% to $8.6 billion, missing expectations. Unit case volume, which strips out the impact of foreign currency, shrank by 3%. All four of its beverage segments reported volume declines.

> * Shares of General Motors fell more than 1% in the premarket after the U.S. automaker said Wednesday that a global semiconductor chip shortage could cut earnings by $1.5 billion and $2 billion this year. GM’s crosstown rival, Ford, last week said the chip shortage could lower its earnings. GM also issued fourth-quarter profit of $1.93 per share on revenue of $37.5 billion. Both beat analyst expectations.

*****

> # 3. Twitter is ‘bigger than any one account,’ CEO says

> * Shares of Twitter rose more than 5.5% in Wednesday’s premarket, the morning after the social media network reported fourth-quarter earnings of 38 cents per share on revenue of $1.29 billion, both of which beat estimates. Monetizable daily active users gained 30% to 192 million from a year ago, but still fell short of expectations. Twitter is “bigger than any one account,” said CEO Jack Dorsey, in his first earnings call following the ban of then-President Donald Trump last month, days after the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol.

*****

> # 4. Trump impeachment trial continues with opening arguments

> * Opening arguments are set begin at noon ET Wednesday in Trump’s second impeachment trial. An emotional first day ended with the Senate voting to hear the case on whether to convict the former president of inciting the Capitol riot even though he’s no longer in office. Watching the proceedings from his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, Trump was furious at what he saw from his attorneys Tuesday, according to a person familiar with his thinking. The 50-50 split Senate is expected to acquit Trump.

*****

> # 5. Covid spike in the U.S. show signs of slowing

> * The crushing coronavirus spike in the U.S. has been showing signs of abating, with 95,360 new cases Tuesday less than a third of the record high new daily infections of 300,282 on Jan. 2. The number of people in U.S. hospitals being treated for Covid-19 totaled 79,179 on Tuesday, the first daily count below 80,000 since Nov. 18.

1) BB has nothing to do with smartphones. Throw those 2007 notions out of your mind and bring yourself to the future

2) Whilst the whole stock market has been pissing themselves for years over EV/AV industry speculation, the reality is that these are hardware companies with low margin, and limited scale potential.

Even Tesla, owned and run by the richest man in the world, has yet to build more than 500,000 cars in one year. Meanwhile Tesla competitors springing up everywhere with both new challengers such as NIO and old money fucks getting into EV such as VW and GM (GM in December 2020 announced 100% by 2030 all cars would be 100% EV).

THE REAL FUCKING MONEY is not in EV production which has low margin and low scale, but in data monetization which is high margin (and being software) has unlimited scale. In the same way that Google makes only $18Bn revenue from hardware sales (phone, nest sales etc) but makes $120Bn from data monetization, $BB is going to to the fucking moon with $200BN revenue + by 2030 with 10% net whilst Tesla and other big auto are fighting over 4% margins (Tesla net profit in 2020 = 4% whilst **BB sat at a juicy 10.15%**).

This industry is going to the fucking moon, and BB is the only one with a front row ticket 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀. This shit is like investing in Google or Amazon in the year 2000, by the time the mainstream saw the potential 5 years later, shit was already at pluto

u/just an everyday life couldn't have put it better: "Zombie cars and QNX

QNX is the first commercial microkernel RTOS. What the fuck does that even mean nerd? For anyone like me who's not a software genius, I've done some research so we all know what we're getting into. A Real Time Operating System is developed to focus processing power on two most important things: Speed and Accuracy. This is different from shit like Windows and Mac OS (General Purpose OS or GPOS) as they spread processing power throughout the system because there isn't exactly anything that's significantly more important than the others. However, when you're using a self-driving program you need the hardware to perform the action at the exact time and speed. Your self driving program brakes too late? Crash into the car ahead of you. Your self program turns the wheel too late or too soon? Crash into a wall.

Blackberry has been working on this technology since 2014. But car makers literally couldn't develop autonomous vehicles fast enough. So these guys have just been twiddling their fucking thumbs.

Fast forward to now, where the rise of Tesla has made everyone and their momma make a self driving EV. Everyone is trying to make their own autopilot program but not their own OS. So who's OS are they using?

SONY? Blackberry QNX. Baidu? QNX baby. XPENG? Blackberry as well. If you read the article, you'll see XPEV is using DESAY's autopilot program that's built on QNX. Know who else is using DESAY autopilot? Li Auto But what about Nio you might ask? Well on NIO day, it was announced that NIO will be using Nvidia DRIVE....which is also built on QNX. What about the Apple car? There's no confirmation yet, but rumors of them reaching out to both Canoo and Hyundai makes me skeptical that Apple has succeeded in creating their own RTOS even after rumors of them starting 7 years ago. But even if they did... it doesn't even matter.

You might have noticed that I didn't mention Tesla at all. That's because they have developed their own Linux-based Operating system, which Tesla has been having trouble getting it approved by US safety regulations. QNX on the other hand, already is. $BB to the fucking moon🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀"

3) BB is a cash flow positive, growing company with near nil competitors in an industry that is skyrocketing. Despite this, the boomer fucks who still believe BB is a smartphone company, have in their own glorious act of autism, have massively shorted BB bringing the share price down. 

BB is a growth company in a growth industry, these hedge funds are going to need to borrow more money if they want to buy tendies after the wider market realizes the market inefficiency that is an undervalued BB. u/Tradergurue went into a lot of detail in his $BB short interest post here [https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8pg8x/short\_interest\_in\_bb\_its\_increasing/](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8pg8x/short_interest_in_bb_its_increasing/) 

TLDR: hedge funds caught with their dicks in their hands are about to get Royally Fucked as the market corrects itself with a BB rise over the next month_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Cresco Labs ($CRLBF) - Why I like this weed stock TL:DR at the bottom. Not financial advice.

With weed stocks gaining momentum, I thought I share one which I believe is undervalued vs other key players. Cresco currently operates in 9 US states.

This analysis will focus on what I believe are the three most important factors for cannabis - Revenue, Revenue Growth, Liquidity.

***Revenue - Cresco vs 5 key players***

- Cresco Labs: 355M Revenue ; Market Cap 3.5B
- Canopy Growth: 477M Revenue ; Market Cap 18.3B
- Curaleaf: 472M Revenue ; Market Cap 11.6B
- Cronos: 37M Revenue ; Market Cap 4.8B
- Tilray*: 201M Revenue ; Market Cap 6.7B
- Aurora: 273M Revenue ; Market Cap 3.1B
- Aphria+Tilray: 803M Revenue ; Market Cap 20B

If we look purely at revenue, only Aurora and Aphria/Tilray merger appears to have a similar market pricing to Cresco, with a Mkt Cap/Revenue ratio of 11 and 13 respectively vs Mkt Cap/Revenue ratio of 10 for Cresco. The 4 other stocks vary from a ratio of 24 to 133.

This means purely on revenue, Cresco could be considered to be undervalued vs other key weed stocks.

***Revenue Growth TTM vs 2019 - Vs 5 key players***

- Cresco Labs: 175% Growth
- Canopy Growth: 111% Growth
- Curaleaf: 114% Growth
- Cronos: 54% Growth
- Tilray*: 20% Growth
- Aurora: 10% Growth
- Aphria+Tilray: 99% Growth

Cresco has by far the highest revenue growth ratio. And this is just looking at ttm vs 2019 as Cresco have their 2020 fiscal calendar report in April. This means on top of these figures, some of these companies would have had more time to grow revenue vs their fiscal calendar 2019 due to differing fiscal calendars.

***Liquidity***

Below I'm only looking at current ratio and quick ratio. The higher the ratio, the better.

- Cresco Labs: 1.06 / 0.53
- Canopy Growth: 6.09 / 5.16
- Curaleaf: 1.42 / 0.64
- Cronos: 4.73 / 4.62
- Tilray*: 2.82 / 1.86
- Aurora: 1.54 / 0.97
- Aphria+Tilray: 4.44 / 3.09

Cresco has a lower market cap as it is a possibility it does go bankrupt this year if things turn for the worse. However Cresco has a positive EBITDA in their last earnings report and if it does get an injection of cash/stronger results than expected, there is massive room to grow to reach the same value as other companies in the same category.

One of the things that is holding it back is that you can only trade the stock on OTC markets or the Canadian exchange. If it does enter a major US exchange, I can see it go big.

Just like every other weed stock, this stock has growth plans with new dispensaries in yada yada, will have better productivity due to yada yada, increases cultivation by xxx% in yada yada due to yada yada space, and has a new Chief Commercial Officer who has great experience in CG in companies such as yada, yada yada, and yabbadabbadoo. Do your own research, all weed stocks have something new and exciting like this one.

Trades as $CRLBF or CAD$CL.CN. I have 120 shares.

TL:DR: Dude weed lmao

I do sympathize with it, it must be annoying seeing a complete sea change in a sub you enjoyed.  I personally lurked, and kind of ingratiated myself. I don’t post to the sub really, just comments.

The best way to solve this would be for someone to set up a new sub, something like “GMEBETS” whatever and then the influx of only GME posters can migrate there.

Kimchi here... back with another DD to make you all some tendies. My last posted DD was all about headphones... ended up being a nice 5-bagger *with stocks*. I'm here today to tell you about Compass Pathways \[$CMPS\], a company I think will be my next multi-bagger trade.

***Psychedelics:***

Why psychedelics? Psychedelic (and $CMPS in particular) companies tend to focus on the medical aspect of shroom use, looking to create medications to **treat illnesses that are traditionally underserviced**. Compass, for example, focuses on treatment resistant depression - essentially depression that hasn't been able to be treated by medication, counseling, etc. Depression rates have been rising for years and CMPS and other psychedelic drug makers look to **target those most affected**.

[Depression rates increasing](https://preview.redd.it/bygysv8wcmg61.png?width=1100&format=png&auto=webp&s=3392bcff460f4e60e1d30201a20b4977fac5fc9a)

Psychedelics have also been anecdotally shown to help with [PTSD](https://maps.org/research/articles/6230-the-veteran-psychedelics-for-ptsd-what-a-long-strange-trip-it-s-been) and [opioid addiction](https://www.wbur.org/commonhealth/2018/09/10/ibogaine-psychedelic-opioid-misuse-therapy). It's a field that's just now starting to gain traction and hopefully those who need help the most will be able to get it as the science develops.

***Why Compass?:***

So why $CMPS out of the many stonks in the psychedelics universe?

*1) Compass Pathways is the only psychedelics company currently listed in the US.* 

I don't mess with OTC stonks (have been burned too many times) and I don't mess with Canadian listings (who calls their currency the "Loonie?). Don't know why other companies haven't listed in the US yet, but I'm not messing with those companies until they do.

*2) Peter Thiel is the largest shareholder and they have a superstar board/advisors.*

Everyone here knows and loves Peter Thiel; he owns 7.5% of the company. The board members at CMPS include the former R&D head at **Merck**, the former Chairman of Global Pharmaceuticals at **Johnson & Johnson**, former Executive Director of the **European Medicines Agency** among others. Their scientific advisory board includes doctors from **Stanford, Harvard, Johns Hopkins, Imperial College**, etc. This is a company stacked with talent.

*3) CMPS has received FDA "*[*breakthrough designation*](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-01-07/psychedelic-mushroom-therapy-startup-edges-toward-fda-approval)*" and are currently on phase 2 trials.*

Breakthrough designations are typically given when preliminary clinical trials show **significant improvements over existing treatments**. "Breakthrough therapies are supported by the FDA throughout the clinical development programme to ensure as efficient a process as possible."

*4) CMPS runs the COMPASS Discovery Center, which is working on finding uses for psychedelics.*

The biggest pushback against $CMPS is that they're currently only working on one product, COMP360, for the treatment of treatment resistant depression. However they also run the COMPASS Discovery Center, a collaboration between Compass Pathways and various universities to find new uses for psychedelics. **$CMPS will be the exclusive licensee for all new compounds generated.**

*5) They're just seem like good people.*

Sure this may not be important to company profits in the long term, but this is something that makes me feel a bit warm and fuzzy inside. They recently [raised](https://www.standard.co.uk/homeless-fund/compass-pathways-support-the-homeless-fund-london-b919073.html) over 1.4mil GBP (Around $2mil 'merica dollars) to **help the homeless in London**. Maybe I'm stupid, but this helps me trust the company's leaders a bit more.

**Target Price:**

I'm not a research analyst so I'm not going to break down the numbers in terms of sales of COMP360 or potential profits from licenses from potential discoveries at COMPASS Discovery Center. Smarter people than I can do that analysis...

However, just looking at how high some of the weed stocks got in 2018, I don't think a market cap of $20bn is a stretch (that would put **$CMPS at around $500 to $600 a share**) if the theme takes off. GW Pharmaceuticals, a cannabis company that specialized in creating medication from cannabis, recently got acquired for $7.2bn. I put my trust in this star-studded company to do some incredible things.

**Positions:**

5,500 shares (I don't do options) of $CMPS.

**tl;dr:** Psychedelics has the potential to help those with depression, PTSD, addiction, etc. Trust in Peter Thiel and $CMPS to take us to tendieland._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $20k to $1.5MM realized gains in 2 months. Holding the rest for double digit millions. GME ofc _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ GME - My thoughts First bought in at $20, subsequently bought many more times up to $329.92. 

I’m well balanced and even now average out at $131.37 including taking enough profit last week to be in the green overall(ahead of what remains invested) and taking into account I invested $4.5k on behalf of my brother which negatively impacts my position. 

I’m up.

I’m comfortable.

I can remain in play indefinitely with zero impact. 

Having said all that, the perfect time to buy across my whole journey is right now. Squeeze ain’t been squoze. Price is reasonable AF. Future is bright. Marketing is free, and as a side bonus there’s half a chance of breaking a hedge fund. 

The future publicity through movies, docos and financial text books is infinite and I can’t see any way that you lose money in the short, medium or long term. The Social network... enough said.

Anyway, you look after you- for me though, this and $pltr are my spare change jar for the next little bit. Bet I’ll be smiling when I stop. 

What’s your pick for the next few years?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ VFF - The perfect storm in weedstocks Gonna keep this brief bc apes hate to read. 🍅🚀

VFF has the LOWEST float of any major LP at 65m shares. Deduct the approx 10m shares the ceo owns and you're looking at 55m shares float (add another couple of mil from the insiders/directors and it's even less). Less shares means high volatility means large potential energy means 🔥🔥🔥 in a bull market!

They are profitable right now. No other public LP can claim that now or in all of 2021. Heck CGC just said they won't become fcf positive til 2024. In the immortal words of Chris Tucker, "do you understand the words that are coming out of my mouth?" Profit = good!

So while they can run with their silly tiny float, they are actually a great company to invest in because they actually make money, have low debt, and have over 100m in the bank. 

Low float + profitable rn + weedstocks = 🔥🔥🔥🚀🚀🚀🍅🍅🍅

And for the simians that can read, check out the recent DDs on them (warning: will require basic math)

Edit: join the r/villagefarms sub_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Avengers: Age of GME _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Why this is just a beginning: a guide for The GME Gang newcomers and a quick recap of the situation Listen up you fucks, for most of you this is your first rodeo so let me tell you how this whole thing works. Some of you might remember me when I told you to hop on this tendie train at 9$ [when MSFT deal happened](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/j7i28q/gme_launching_right_about_now_microsoft_agreement/), by [my DD about why GameStop is worth 138$](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jcjqba/gme_long_thesis_why_40_target_is_actually_a/) or by my other posts I've made here for months. As you've noticed, I LOVE THE STOCK.

I've held through -90% at the lowest to +10,000% at the highest and I continue holding. I'm down $300k from the ATH at this point and I don't fucking care because this whole thing is far from being over.

Now get these points through your thick head:

    
* **This is a fucking volatile stock.** 

This is how it goes: it shoots up, GME gang rejoices, a bunch of retards buys at the top. Then it crashes down for a while, 🌈🐻 keep blabbering about how the squeeze has squoze. Rinse and repeat. Every time it shoots up it does it more violently, the amplitude getting larger and larger. And every time it does there is a number of dickheads whining about not buying earlier:

"I wish I bought at $9..." - when it shot up to $13, and them came down

"I wish I bought at $11..." - when it shot up to $20, and them came down

"I wish I bought at $17..." - when it shot up to $70, and them came down

"I wish I bought at $40..." - when it shot up to $150, and them came down

"I wish I bought at $60..." - when it shot up to $450, and them came down

**Being in GME gang was always about not caring about temporary swings, because in the end, the price always sets a new ATH**

I've seen this shit happening so many times since October that I just sit there and smile while history repeats itself and my porfolio swings 5-6 digits.

    
    
* **GME was never a squeeze play**, despite what a lot of you retards think. 

Read any DD more than a month old, the whole company is massively undervalued . Read about Ryan Cohen, a person who made a dog food company worth $45bn and who is a fucking shark, once he sets his mind to something he will never back down. Thanks to him we now have a star team assembled at GameStop formed of [Matt Francis, CTO, former Engineering Leader at AWS; Kelli Durkin, Senior Vice President of Customer Care, former Chewy’s Vice President of Customer Service; Josh Krueger, Vice President of Fulfillment former senior fulfillment roles at Amazon, Walmart, and QVC](https://www.dallasnews.com/business/retail/2021/02/03/gamestop-announces-three-new-hires) (do I need to mention Reggie Fils-Aimé of a fucking Nintendo?). I am a firm believer that Cohen will manage to grow GameStop at the very least to the size of Chewy ($45bn market cap). Guess what GME has? $4bn. That's 12x bagger and I'm being very conservative here.

**This is not about squeezing the hedge funds, this is about the company establishing it's true share price with wild swings along the way thanks to the 🌈🐻s**. The true price for me is (conservatively) the size of Chewy, which translates to $650. I know I said $138 in my previous DD a few months ago, but it was before all the recent news of Ryan Cohen taking over with his star-team.

MOASS was a cherry on top (and still is on the table), not the main play

Also, GameStop had a $6bn in revenue in 2019, Tesla had $24bn. Think about it for a moment
    
    

* **Short interest is still through fucking roof**. 

I know you're used to 100%+ SI and the new 41% number does not quite gets you off, but it's still fucking abysmal. VW, OSTK happened on less than 20%. Also keep in mind that this number is for 1/29, literally the top when a lot of shorts covered. It does not account for all the shorting that happened on the way down to $50 which I guaran-fucking-tee you was massive. Just wait and see the next report with increased SI, the shorts never learn.



**TL;DR:** GameStop is still undervalued. Conservative PT is $650, ambitious - $1200+ (assuming Ryan Cohen's success, which I don't doubt for a single moment). Short squeeze will last for a long time similar to $TSLA squeeze, with wild swings along the way - old shorts will cover, new ones will pile in because the bLoCkBuStEr narrative is still strong. This is still a risky gamble, no such thing as a sure bet, but the risk\reward is massively skewed to the upside

If you have short-dated calls you might be fucked, might be not. If you have shares or LEAPS, just get away from screens for a while if it's unbearable for you, but ultimately you'll be fucking loaded. This is one of those situations when in a year or two the price is $3000+ and you post your cost basis of $70 and all the paper-handed bitches in the comments scream "WOW HE FUCKING HELD GRATZ"

**Positions:** some Apr 40c, some Apr 200c and a shitload of Jan 2023 950c. Will dump the remaining cash into 2023 calls at open_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ NYSE v. Off-Exchange(FINRA) Short Volumes for GME: Short Volume in Public Exchanges Wasn't Even Half of Whats Needed for 150% Drop in Short Interest **The drop in SI from 226% to 78% required around \~100 Million shares to cover shorts, but the NYSE only saw 49 Million Short Volume, while OFF-EXCHANGES saw about 3X as much.**

Got the **Daily Short Exchange Trade data from NYSE now** so I can compare it to the FINRA numbers that I've been using in the past. General bullet points below:

# TLDR: Check bottom, look at Figure 1, and Napkin Math.

&#x200B;

* **Publicly traded stocks(GME on the NYSE) can be traded "upstairs" in OFF-EXCHANGES (OTC) but have to be reported... or should be...**
* **Daily Short Sales files only contain how many short sale trades were done that day.**
* **Short sale trades done on NYSE  are NOT in the FINRA data, and vice versa.**
* **The GOOD STUFF is in the** [MONTHLY SHORT SALES FILES](https://www.finra.org/filing-reporting/trf/trf-regulation-sho-2021) **and it isn't out yet for January.**

&#x200B;

To start out we can compare the total volumes for GME across the public exchange, NYSE, against the off-exchange, FINRA's numbers.

[Figure 0: I DONT HAVE ALL THE VOLUME, as YAHOO reports nearly double what NYSE and FINRA are reporting. Missing Volume was added to show Yahoo-\(NYSE+FINRA\)](https://preview.redd.it/7rohwucqflg61.png?width=752&format=png&auto=webp&s=bf399f5180a2bc22c68320fad0eb8f542c1b3299)

* *DISCLAIMER: No idea where the Missing Volume is from, but it's not on the NYSE and not being reported to FINRA? Does Yahoo count volume some other way?*
* I sure as hell didn't know that what happens in off exchanges is about five times that of public exchanges, but we got data now. Notice how it really doesn't pick up until the 13th though, and it seems to be settling down as we get further into February.

&#x200B;

[Figure 1: Comparing NYSE to OFF-EXCHANGE short volume with respect to GME's Float.](https://preview.redd.it/4qhtpaqqflg61.png?width=721&format=png&auto=webp&s=67ca1196548a84f92c5c8d87b1c83b2f863cf812)

* Figure 1 lays out just exactly where the shorts are going on. Jan 13th nearly used the entirety of the GME Float in the off-exchange.

&#x200B;

[Figure 2: Short Volume\/Total Volume from FINRA and NYSE Daily Short Volume files, respectively.](https://preview.redd.it/n0zdmv7czlg61.png?width=743&format=png&auto=webp&s=df17986998464f35f8053bb0c3c3daa92285cdf2)

* Figure 2 shows us that around \~50% of all the volume, no matter which exchange, is around shorts, even before Jan 13th.
* Jan 19th - 26th, see how the NYSE actually leads in short volume/total volume on those days, WHICH were also the same days that GME shot up toward $400+

&#x200B;

Next I wanted to run some numbers to be able to compare to other bi-monthly reports for GME and actually look at the exact numbers across the public exchange and the off-exchanges.

&#x200B;

|FINRA|Jan 4th-15th|Jan 16th-29th|Feb 1st-9th|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Short Volume|84,529,878|155,033,361|79,236,275|
|Short Exempt Volume|1,119,003|**3,437,532**|**4,306,437**|
|Total Volume|193,791,490|415,527,741|146,617,603.00|
|Short Vol/Float|1.80|3.31|1.69|

# NOTE: SHORT EXEMPT VOLUME IS THE ONLY THING NYSE HAS MORE OF THAN OFF-EXCHANGES!

&#x200B;

|NYSE|Jan 4th-15th|Jan 16th-29th|Feb 1st-9th|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Short Volume|13,279,699|49,046,558|19,041,023|
|Short Exempt Volume|587,776|**5,075,452**|**7,304,781**|
|Total Volume|31,822,868|105,950,709|43,875,824|
|Short Vol/Float|0.28|1.05|0.41|

Now let's use some of these numbers to check some reports.

# NAPKIN MATH TIME

1. So 226% SI for around Jan 15th  and we're at 78% SI reporting now, from end of January.
2. 226-78 = \~150
3. 150% Short Interest = 150 (Shorts/SharesOutstanding)
4. Shares Outstanding = \~70Million
5. 70Million \* 1.50 = **105 Million Shorts were settled from 15th to 29th**

OK, I can believe that 105M shorts went through because that's when GME went up to to $400+

The only thing is, and here's the kicker...

# Of the 100+Million shorts only 49 Million were executed on the                     NYSE during Jan15th to 29th!

We still have 55 Million shorts that were executed those two weeks, and in the FINRA exchanges we can see the155 Million short volume.

But how/where do they do this OFF-EXCHANGE trade you might ask?

*"For market makers with a customer order to sell, they will temporarily  sell short (which gets published to the tape as a media transaction for public dissemination) and then immediately buy from their customer in a  non-media transaction that is not publicly disseminated to avoid double  counting share volumes."*\-  [OTCMarkets.com](https://blog.otcmarkets.com/2018/11/13/understanding-short-sale-activity/)

* **If you sold GME via any of those apps, chances are they bought up those shares themselves AFTER they used them to cover their shorts.**
* **The rest of the shorts are just in the ether of OTC exchanges**

Granted I can't get data for how many of the shorts were fully executed, how many started to juggle around with options, but we do know that before tonight the SI was above 200% and has been updated to 78%.

I believe that the update is referring to data at the end of January. CORRECT ME IN COMMENTS!!!

**TLDR:**

1. **NYSE see's only 1/5 the volume that OFF-EXCHANGES do regarding short volumes for GME**
2. **"Short Exempts"are nearly twice as prevalent in the NYSE than OTC**
3. **Only half of the shorts were executed on the NYSE to decrease SI from 226% to 78%**
4. **Still waiting on FINRA for the**  [**FINRA Monthly Short Sale File**](https://www.finra.org/filing-reporting/trf/trf-regulation-sho-2021)

&#x200B;

Not advice of any kind, I should have been writing my thesis instead of this shit, and I miss chewy runts!

Edit:  u/SolveThisProblem pointed out that different sites use different definitions for SI: In the post I used short/(outstanding shares (yahoo finance) to calculate the 226% to 78% SI change, however Morningstar/FINRA  use shorts/ float which is (Outstanding Shares - Insider Holdings - Untrading lnst. Holdings.)_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ NVAX - 3 to 4x potential - Market ignoring recurring revenue As NVAX was late to party, analysts estimated its initial revenue lower.

But given the [mutations](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-29/world-s-most-vaccinated-nation-struggles-with-new-virus-variants) and booster vaccine development in full steam, I think covid 19 revenue are very likely to extend beyond this year. [UK authorities are already laying out plans](https://www.ft.com/content/26b256d0-d021-46ac-ae3d-e3ea823c033d) for annual vaccination. In such scenario, NVAX is actually better placed than Moderna.

So Q2 2020 onwards, I dont see NVAX revenue to be lower than Moderna. Market is already beginning to realize that. I expect its market cap to come inline **🚀🚀🚀🚀**

I believe most people are likely to go for Novavax when it comes to next jab because:

1. [Much lower side effects as compared to Moderna/Pfizer](https://www.racap.com/media/Covid-19/COVID-19_VX_12222020_F.pdf?v=tY2fmi5jaTcPs6s4xSzi_QUhEV8v0ayLLWYwd-p1upM)
2. Cheaper (<= $16 per dose)
3. Virus variants are becoming bigger problem. [Protein subunit vaccines are better placed for covering variants than MRNA](https://twitter.com/PeterKolchinsky/status/1354929047797706756)
4. They plan to make a [Combo vaccine with their Nanoflu](https://www.reuters.com/article/health-coronavirus-novavax/novavax-to-explore-combined-influenza-covid-19-vaccine-for-use-post-pandemic-idUKL4N2H42Z7?edition-redirect=uk) \- so instead of annual flu vaccine, people can simply go for combo
5. And obviously [highest efficacy (95.6% original, 86% UK, 60% SA strain)](https://ir.novavax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/novavax-covid-19-vaccine-demonstrates-893-efficacy-uk-phase-3). Only vaccine which has [evidence](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.05.429759v1) of [sterilizing immunity](https://thehill.com/changing-america/well-being/prevention-cures/501677-what-is-sterilizing-immunity-and-do-we-need-it)

It seems incredible that `NVAX market cap is just $20B when Moderna is valued at $71B`. To reach $71B, NVAX shares will need to shoot to **$1116 🚀🚀🚀🚀**

It can be argued that lower price than Moderna means lower revenue. But lower price coupled with no deep freeze requirement will translate to much higher market share. On top of that, they already have another very successful vaccine (Nanoflu - influenza) which completed phase 3 trial in March 2020.

On Jan 29th, Principal investigator of their UK trial had expected [full analyses target of 100 cases to be reached in 2 weeks](https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/944923#vp_2). It seems we should be pretty close to next price action now.

Disclosure: I am long Nvax March 19 calls_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Shaq, Lebron, & TikTok's Ex-CEO company JUST announced its $3B merger with Beachbody (Full Retard Mode ACTIVATED) I'm about go full retard.

Some people involved with this (which is honestly a big part of why I'm about to Forest Gump my ass through Vietnam, across the fucking country, and back home to lose my virginity to a chick with AIDs just to get this thing):

* Shaq
* Kevin Mayer, Former TikTok CEO
* Lebron "hold my dick" James
* Arnold Schwarzenegger
* Tom Staggs, former Disney CFO & COO

The announcement ***just*** came out. [Full version](http://on.wsj.com/3aP3Gzc) for those of you with actual attention spans.

For those that don't. Here are the **highlights**:

"Fitness-and-nutrition business the Beachbody Company Group LLC plans to merge with a blank-check company affiliated with former TikTok Chief Executive Kevin Mayer in a deal that values the combined company at nearly $3 billion."

As part of the deal, Myx Fitness LLC, an at-home connected cycling provider, will become part of The Beachbody Company.

Beachbody is expected to generate more than $1.1 billion of revenue this year.

"Beachbody said it plans to use the capital to expand its sales and digital marketing efforts and to enter new geographies"

Other awesome things about this team:

* Lebron James and Arnold Schwarzenegger are involved (to what extent, I'm not sure but Beachbody [owns the majority stake in their shared company Ladder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beachbody_Company#Divisions))
* The company [also owns P90X](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beachbody_Company#History)

**My Basic DD:**

The company is well diversified between 3 separate entities. Each with complementary but different offerings. The fitness offering, I think, pairs really well with their roster on the team which (as covered above) is highly experienced in sports and media.

Peloton is due for a competitor. It's a great platform but it's not the solution EVERYONE needs. MYX Fitness' products offer added choice to a marketplace that is foaming at the mouth for more options.

The company has been around for over 20 years which is just a nice reassurance that the biz actual works

Because of how the deal is structured, it appears the company will now be, more than ever, able to expand via acquisitions (they actually mention this in the article) and ***HEAVY*** digital marketing spend.

Again, this literally **JUST** came out like an hour ago._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ I know you were apes, but not THAT retarded First of all: Alle the GME movement was like a week ago and you retards got stopped by a never seen change of rules.

WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?

I only see whining and retards complaining. It's NOTHING, compared to timeframes we seen on WSB so far and you still can't get your ass up and fucking HOLD and believe in what we want to achieve.

When the stonk blew, we couldn't stop the posts and memes about how GME is going to moon and everybody was circlejerking, but as soon as some retards on wallstreet spread lies and change rules, you hush and start being nervous and SELL. WHAT IS WORNG WITH YOU RETARDS? They got EXACTLY what they wanted. And you know what the worst part is?

**YOU RETARDS EVEN TOLD US THAT THIS WILL HAPPEN.**

Did you think that the hedge funds would just run away in fear and loose their face AND money? Didn't you think they'd fight with dirty moves and get away with it? Haven't you learned from 2008?

Face it! We're apes. And now we're not together, because they spread lies, misinformation and doubt on reddit, news and magazines. They can trick the DUMB. Are you dumb?

I'm not going to lie, I first joined the whole train for the fast money and bought @270€ for 2k€, because I have debts of 10k€ and a lawsuit going against me. I can't afford to pay back anymore because COVID made me loose my job. I'm basically fucked and don't know what to do and stand with my back at the wall. But guess what?

**I STILL HOLD.**

This isn't about money anymore. This isn't about saving before shit goes down. This isn't about believe that the squeeze will come.

**This is because I believe in you retards and I want wallstreet to bleed for what they did.**

And so should you! Stop whining, stop getting in doubt.

For ONE fucking time in your life - just do **NOTHING** and **HOLD**.

WSB showed the whole world how fucked up the market is. And if they played by the rules, we'd have fucked them in a very autistic and ironic way. But guess what. War isn't held by rules.

tl;dr: you sell = bad monke. you hold = we'll see us on moon

Well autist, if this is you, then you should stick around for this DD. I'll be comparing the four hottest airlines and make a case for why I $LUV Southwest. This can also serve as a walkthrough if you still don't know how to do your own DD. So grab a beer, strap on your helmet, and review the alphabet one more time, because hopefully by the end of this you'll learn how to do your own DD.

# Financials

Ok, let's start by examining some financial metrics. Now, we don't want to just look at a snapshot of these companies' financials at the end of 2020; we also want to see what these metrics looked like before some guy decided to chow on some bat soup. This will help to give us an idea of how they changed and what to look forward to as we approach reopening.

For the 7 million of  you new here (holy fuck), or for those of you with aggressively smooth brains, I'll go over some of the more complicated metrics.

* **P/E ratio** (price-to-earnings ratio) - share price divided by EPS. This can help us determine the relative value of a company's share price compared to its competitors.
* **P/S ratio** (price-to-sales ratio) - market capitalization divided by revenue. This shows how much investors think each share is worth compared to the company's revenue.
* **Profit Margin** \- profit divided by revenue. This tells us what percent of revenue actually turns into profit.

These are simple calculations, and you can find all the data necessary on yahoo finance \[1\]. If you don't know what profit, revenue, EPS, or market cap are, then at this point just buy 0DTE SPY puts and hope for the best. Below is a table of these metrics for UAL, AAL, DAL, and LUV for the year 2019.

&#x200B;

|Ticker|Share Price (EOY)|Market Cap|Revenue|Profit|P/E|P/S|Profit Margin|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|UAL|$88|$22.1B|$43.3B|$12.5B|7333|0.51|28.9%|
|AAL|$27|$12.4B|$45.7B|$10.4B|7105|0.27|22.8%|
|DAL|$58|$37.6B|$47.0B|$10.4B|7945|0.80|22.1%|
|LUV|$54|$28.0B|$22.0B|$6.0B|12558|1.27|27.3%|

&#x200B;

LUV's P/E and P/S ratios from 2019 may suggest that it was overvalued compared to the other airlines. But this won't matter to you once we see how much better they are doing compared to the rest of the field in 2020. Below is a table of the same metrics for these airlines for the year 2020.

&#x200B;

|Ticker|Share Price (EOY)|Market Cap|Revenue|Profit|P/E|P/S|Profit Margin|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|UAL|$43|$22.1B|$15.4B|\-5.0B|\-1.70|1.44|\-32.5%|
|AAL|$16|$9.8B|$17.3B|\-7.6B|\-0.87|0.57|\-43.9%|
|DAL|$40|$25.6B|$17.1B|\-6.5B|\-2.05|1.50|\-38.0%|
|LUV|$47|$26.3B|$9.0B|\-1.9B|\-8.64|2.92|\-21.1%|

&#x200B;

Again, the P/E and P/S ratios could suggest that LUV is overvalued compared to the rest of the field, but a valuation above its competitors is warranted because of how much better its profit and profit margins are. But these metrics are just a part of the picture; we also want to analyze a company's balance sheet to see how it fairs in terms of its total assets and liabilities.

# Balance Sheet

A company's balance sheet can easily be located on their annual 10-K or quarterly 10-Q SEC filings \[2\]. The data for this analysis will be extracted from each company's 10-Q form for Q3 (since not all of them have filed a 10-K for 2020). The two sections on the balance sheet we want to pay close attention to are the assets and liabilities.

In the current assets section, we'll be looking at AR (accounts receivable) and most importantly CASH, because CASH is KING. It's important for a company to have lots of cash on hand because it shows how able they are to pay off short term debts. There are other sources of assets listed in the file, but I'll skip those since they aren't as important as cash and AR.

In the current liabilities section, we'll be looking at AP (accounts payable) and maturing debt (debt that is owed pretty soon). All you need to know about AR and AP is that they are basically opposites. AR is money that a third party owes the company pretty damn soon, and AP is money that the company owes a third party pretty damn soon. A good rule of thumb is that these values should generally match up. Here as well, there are other sources of liabilities listed in the file, but I'm skipping them because they aren't as important as debt and AP.

Lastly, we'll also take a look at long-term debts and debt-to-equity ratio, to determine how much debt a company has to pay off in the future and how much debt they are leveraging to finance their assets.

Still with me? Ok good, more numbers now. Shown below is a table of the current assets of UAL, AAL, DAL, and LUV.

&#x200B;

|Ticker|Total Current Assets|Cash|Accounts Receivable|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|UAL|$16.5B|$13.2B|$1.2B|
|AAL|$21.4B|$0.2B|$1.1B|
|DAL|$25.0B|$16.5B|$1.5B|
|LUV|$16.1B|$12.1B|$0.9B|

There are two things you should note about this table. First, around 75% of LUV's total assets is cold hard cash. We like to see that. This also compares closely with UAL's cash. But another thing to note is how dogshit AAL's small pp pile of cash is. They're in some shit and will probably have to leverage more debt to make short-term payments. But regardless of that, so far so good for LUV. But let's see how everyone is doing with their liabilities. Shown below is a table of the current liabilities of these airlines.

&#x200B;

|Ticker|Total Current Liabilities|Current maturities of long-term debt|Accounts Payable|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|UAL|$15.8B|$4.6B|$1.8B|
|AAL|$16.3B|$2.7B|$1.0B|
|DAL|$19.7B|$5.0B|$2.4B|
|LUV|$7.8B|$0.7B|$1.0B|

Hopefully by now you're starting to see how much doper LUV is compared to its competitors. LUV has more than double the current assets to liabilities, less than $1 billion in short-term debt (which is easily covered by their amount of cash), and generally equal AR and AP. No other company listed here checks all three boxes.

Finally, we'll examine long-term debt and debt-to-equity ratio shown in the table below.

&#x200B;

|Ticker|Long-term Debt|Debt-to-Equity Ratio|
|:-|:-|:-|
|UAL|$22.3B|7.74|
|AAL|$26.5B|\-12.36|
|DAL|$29.8B|22.6|
|LUV|$10.1B|2.64|

Immediately glaring off that table is the fact that DAL is levered to the tits and AAL has a negative debt-to-equity ratio. So in essence, DAL is dogshit, and AAL is dogshit wrapped in catshit. But our shining star LUV has a debt-to-equity ratio of only 2.64 which, when considering how the pandemic has impacted air travel, is pretty fucking stellar. And compared to the rest of the field, LUV is sitting pretty with only $10 billion in long-term debt.

# Business Operations

Now that we've seen the numbers, it's time to dig a little deeper to see how Southwest's business operations will lead it through the reopening. Most of the following information can be found in Southwest's 10-K filing (I'll link any alternative sources). Southwest began operations in 6 new airports in 2020 and plans to begin operations in 8 more airports in 2021, including Chicago O'Hare (hint: that's a big one).

The Boeing 737 MAX also has a role to play in all of this. These aircraft are more fuel efficient than their predecessors (hint: this saves costs), and Southwest is quick to add them to their fleet. I know you're probably thinking the MAX is dangerous and a liability to the company, but I promise you the MAX is probably the safest plane in the sky right now because Boeing knows they'd be in deep shit if they fucked it up again. Southwest will start flying MAXs again in March, and they currently lease or own 41 of these aircraft, which is about 5% of their fleet. This year they will be adding 107 more MAX 7s and MAX 8s, which will then make up 17% of their fleet.

But what really sets Southwest apart from these other large airlines is that the vast majority of their business is domestic, so during a reopening economy, they will see operations return to normal much faster than their competitors that also rely on revenue from international flights.

Finally, Southwest continues to offer low fares in part due to their use of higher complexity flight plan optimization models. They use linear flight systems instead of the simpler and more common hub and spoke methods that other airlines utilize \[3\]. If all that flew over your head, don't worry, all you need to know is that this helps Southwest save costs.

# Institution Holdings

For any DD, it's also important to see if institutions own a certain stock. It's always good to have the big boys on your side in an investment. Let's see how institutional ownership compares across the airlines we've been studying.

&#x200B;

|Ticker|Institutional Ownership|
|:-|:-|
|UAL|57.2%|
|AAL|43.8%|
|DAL|60.9%|
|LUV|76.0%|

As you can see, the big boys favor LUV over the rest \[4\].

# Technicals

Fuck outta here with your crayons. This is a DD for a long-term play so miss me with those head and shoulders, cup and handle, batman, or dick n balls lookin ass patterns.

# Final Notes on Macroeconomic Trends

After being locked down for a year, there's going to be some serious pent up demand for vacations and travel. Southwest is in a perfect position to meet these demands with its low fares, and will emerge from the pandemic mostly unscathed relative to its competitors. Also, two bags fly free? Say no more fam. With that being said, I think Southwest is on pace to eclipse its ATH and I see its share price worth no less than $80 EOY (maybe more considering the retard strength of this market).

However, this thesis and price target is completely invalid if the market turns bearish, no matter how successful the reopening is for airlines. But, as long as the Federal Reserve continues to support the heights of this market, then calls on everything.

&#x200B;

Positions: LUV 1/20/23 70C

&#x200B;

If you made it this far, congratulations. If you didn't, fuck you, read the TL;DR I guess. Did I leave anything important out? Do you disagree with my thesis because of some critical information that I didn't pick up on? Let me know. Also if you enjoyed this and want to see another DD, I'll take some suggestions.

&#x200B;

TL;DR

* LUV profited way better than its competitors during the pandemic
* LUV has a great balance sheet compared to its competitors
* LUV is adding more destinations and using more MAX aircraft ($$$$$)
* Institutions love LUV
* Pent up demand for travel this year means $$$$$$

I had the same reaction until I looked them up. Motional is not some fly-by-night start-up.


1. They are a $4 Billion joint venture between Hyundai and Aptiv where Hyundai put in $1.4 Billion dollars and has the backing of the South Korean government which expects them to have fleet rollout by 2024.

Basics. Market cap is smallish roughly 40bIl. Means even if they double they are still tiny compared to Tesla! Even if the 10x they are half the size of Tesla. This means room to grow 🚀🚀🚀🚀 Everyone knows “Ford” there’s rumors a merger with Tesla but I don’t think it would ever happen the brand “Ford” is like Disney to famous be acquired but it’s a possibility because Ford has the factories and can pump out tons of cars FAST something Tesla struggles with.

They are doubling down on EV now! Mache-e has the WOW factor which = free advertising for them via social media. Beats out Tesla in almost all the reviews. Branco also has the wow factor! Legacy brands and consumer loyalty. Has factors in place already ready to ramp up EV FAST!🚀🚀🚀🚀

F-150 going electric in a few years this is THE truck there really isn’t any other truck out there because Ford is undeniably the best truck maker in the world.

Cheaper because of EV government credits which Tesla doesn’t get anymore.🚀🚀🚀🚀

 “Not to mention they're one of 3 companies in the running for a multi billion dollar deal with the USPS to manufacture EV mail trucks and they have the strongest chance at getting it considering their history providing vehicles for the government and that one of the other companies is a European company.”_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Time to talk about UNG Mods blocked my first post for some reason so here it is again

Haven't heard much on WSB about the freezing cold hitting the US these next weeks so I wanted to point out a strategy with retard level returns. About half the homes in the use [natural gas](https://www.eia.gov/consumption/residential/images/whf_longformat_0132018.pdf) to heat their home and the other half uses electricity, but guess [what the majority of electricity generated in the US is with natural gas](https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/electricity/electricity-in-the-us.php#:~:text=Natural%20gas%20was%20the%20largest,in%202019%E2%80%94about%2023%25) at 38%. Most people are ignoring it because of the green stock push, but the only green is dollar bills :D Starting tomorrow and in the upcoming weeks its going to get extremely [cold](https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/predictions/814day/index.php).

Why does this matter? Supply and Demand baby production has not recovered from its its drop last year and is not expected to return to normal until [2022](https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=46476). This means that production is not replenishing storage as fast as other years. Right now there is a small surplus in working storage if weather holds (hence the long term trade) that surplus will be a deficit by Feb 19. At that point working storage is going to be 2000 BCF.  Here is the kicker there working storage can't go lower than 1000 Bcf of gas because there needs to be natural gas in the pipelines for them to work. The closer it gets to this number there, the price of natgas is going to shoot up!! Officially working storage does not stop getting emptied until the 2nd week of April meaning there is going be 8 weeks of withdraws.

The best part is that there will always be a buyer for natural gas!! Utilities will always need to buy  natural gas for electrical generation. Right now they are in denial and just keep wishing that the problem goes away. But just ask [Japanese utilities](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-07/asian-spot-lng-price-hits-record-on-cold-winter-supply-crunch) what happens when storage starts to run low!!!

**Why buy now** its cheap right now, most traders are waiting for winter to verify and the utilities are hoping that it never happens. Of course you should only be trying this if you can afford to.

$UNG is the ETF that tracks natural gas and will start going to the moon the lower the storage goes.

There are also many natural gas producers that will benefit with the rise of the price. This is especially true if management takes advantage of the price move and locks in prices for the rest of the year (they have the ability to do that) .

Because this is WSB I found the Natural gas producer with the largest short percentage at 16%. That would be RRC

For those of you that want to follow the [natural gas storage numbers](https://ir.eia.gov/ngs/ngs.html) (updated every Thursday at 10:30 ET)

**TLDR:** If you can afford to buy UNG now because its gonna get really cold in the US for the next three weeks. If you want to go full retard and attempt a short squeeze RRC is your best bet with 16% of its volume float at 16%.

And I love you for the same reason._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Tomorrow, next week, or 50 years from now! _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Why I'm long furniture and mattresses. One of the first things I read about investing is to start investing in an industry you're familiar with.  Welp, I'm familiar with the furniture/mattress industry.  The demand for furniture and mattresses is through the roof right now.  You can verify this yourself if you want.  Go to your local furniture store and ask how long it will take to custom order a sofa (change the fabric/leather).  The likely answer will be 6-8 months.  This is obviously because of Covid.  


Prices for furniture and mattresses are rising on an almost weekly basis right now.  This is due to Covid shutdowns at the factories, the stimulus checks being right in the wheelhouse of furniture prices (hmmm, stuck at home and I just got $600-$1200 for "free" what should I buy? A new sofa!), and, believe it or not, a hurricane a few months ago that wiped out foam factories and caused a huge delay in manufacturing.


I'm long PRPL (I know it was a meme stock on WSB for a while, but look at it's gains over the last year).


Long LZB.  They're 7-8 months out for new orders right now (I know this because I still get their "update" emails for retailers for some reason).



And I'm long ~~TSI~~ (edit TSX, whoops).  Tempur-pedic and Sealy merged a few years ago, but they didn't fully integrate their operations until last month.  They actually shut down production of their mattresses in December until Jan 15 of this year so they could optimize their production.  Up until that point, they were essentially operating as two separate companies.  Not anymore.

It's no secret that this sub is full of people making fun of the GME bag holders.  I know what you're thinking, they're just so retarded that you can't help make fun of them.  But according to the highly intelligent analysis on reddit, hedge funds are actually paying people to post on reddit to try to get retail investors to sell their 0.748589 shares.

So since people are shitting on bag holders anyways, let's make a recruitment thread where you can put your shitposting resume and get some of that sweet hedge fund / wall street money.

Get in quick, because the reddit experts have assured me that the sub is overrun with shills and bots, so this is your chance to get paid.

###Skills

###Notable Accomplishments

Accused of being both a George Soros shill and a Russian bot._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ We started the fire. I love you guys. I respect everything this movement has become. Not only did the GameStop coalition make some of you brilliant people pay off their student loans, put down payments on houses, and make multiple charitable donations to great causes, but it caused the world to see the flaws in the 'system' and 'the free market'. I'm in my late twenties and I've seen the best this country can't be.

My dad is a salesman. Growing up as a kid in the 90s, he supported me and my three siblings our whole lives. Before the the 2000s, bonuses were spread throughout the company he worked for at the time. If the company did well, if the sales people did a good job for the company they work for, everyone was given a fair bonus in accordance with the profits brought in. This way of comradery (fairness) doesn't seem to exist anymore. We see it as a fantasy that both the CEO and subordinates, that earn the company the real profits, can both profit together.

Everyone involved in the day-to-day labor worked their tails off for the betterment of the company they put the hours in for. All for the wellbeing for them and their families. Both the higher ups and 'underlings' worked in sync with one another for the most part, that being the chairmen of the company and the salespeople/installers that are involved in selling/implementing the product and all prospered from the work being done. 

I am affected by that dream. I am censored by the billionaires/trillionaires that exist today. This trickle down effect where someone can be a literal trillionaire and the people under them are making fractions of those fractions of a salary for them and their families makes me nauseous. I'm tired of witnessing the general public just accepting it for the sign of the times. To be honest, it goes way past accepting it when it comes to the big wigs literally shutting trading down for people like us. People that see the shift in where it should be to where it is now. 

I am fully in support of $GME and I hope the stock goes stratospheric like we all hope it will. But if you cant afford it, stocks like $BB, $PLTR, or $AMC should not be given up on. I guess I would just like to say I care for you and your future gains deeply and lets never give up trying to get back the American Dream that was promised to us after those crazy student loans or incredible debt. Good luck and Good fortune to all of you. Lets rock the world.

$ADLR_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ The real GME play is next month's earnings Listen up apes; I know lots of you lost a lot of money over the past couple of weeks because you jumped on the hype train too late and bought the peak. I didn't. I invested in GME in December and took my 3000% profits on the 29th when it became clear that the momentum was over and that Wall Street would play all sorts of dirty tricks to prevent a true parabolic squeeze. I may not be half the autist that u/deepfuckingvalue is, but since I actually made money off this stock maybe you should listen to me instead of the bagholding conspiracy theorists who have been reaching the top of this sub lately.

GME won't be going to $1000, or even return to $420.69 anytime soon. That being said, GME is still an undervalued company with great growth potential. Lots of smart people have put out excellent DD on this company and I won't attempt to equal their work; if you want an overview and some valuation estimates just visit [gmedd.com](https://gmedd.com) or watch Roaring Kitty's old streams.

Here's the deal: short interest is still pretty high and mainstream investors largely remain convinced of the BS "next Blockbuster" narrative. This belief, plus the WSB bagholders who are gradually cashing out is pushing the stock below the $60-$100 range I believe to be approximate fair market value. **GME is unlikely to rocket again until this belief is challenged, and the best opportunity for that to happen is the Q4 earnings announcement in late March**.

[In the sales report released early last month](https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-reports-2020-holiday-sales-results), Gamestop reported strong sales figures for the incomplete 4th quarter of 2020 and indicated that it expects to report a profitable earnings report in March. **If GME reports a Q4 profit next month, it will directly refute the bear thesis of financial ruin and impending bankruptcy. This could cause another short/gamma squeeze around earnings, though likely smaller in scale than craziness a couple weeks ago.** The earnings announcement could also include new information about the company's innovation efforts, improvements in e-commerce and customer service, and creation of new revenue streams (PC building kiosks anyone?)

This is not financial advice and you should make investment decisions according to your own research, investment goals, and personal risk tolerance. I currently have 63 GME short puts at the $60 strike expiring on 2/19, and after assignment I plan to hold through earnings and maybe buy a few calls beforehand.

**TLDR for the illiterate:** ⏭️📅🎮🛑📈🦍🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🌙_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Naked shorting in GME and how the pieces suddenly fit together TLDR: **Naked shorting appears prevalent in GME, and if true was likely aided by DTCC, whom by extension may have shut down the short squeeze on 1/28 because it would've caused a massive scandal had the squeeze happened**. I know ape can't read but I implore you to read the whole thing (originally wasn't going to add a TLDR but decided to add it just so more people will read even just a little bit)

I was doing some research on naked shorting in the context of GME which led me down a rabbit hole of pieces connecting with each other as it relates to GME. I was taking notes while reading and below are the results of my notes. This is still a hypothesis and theory but appears supported by numerous pieces of the puzzle, I could be wrong but personally the pieces seem clear to me now:

One of the interesting things about GME and a big part of what triggered the short squeeze happening is the extraordinarily large short interest percentage reported by Finra to be 226%, and later in the range of 150% percent of total float. Another interesting factor is the extraordinarily high number of FTIDs ([https://wherearetheshares.com/](https://wherearetheshares.com/)). Both are strong indicators of the practice of naked short selling which in general is illegal. In addition there have been many indications that there are far more shares out there then should exist (there are many analysis and data points pointing to this but just one example: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le235t/gme\_institutions\_hold\_177\_of\_float\_why\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le235t/gme_institutions_hold_177_of_float_why_the/)). Where do these shares come from? One potential explanation is synthetic long shares (created via a loophole described here [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leorks/evidence\_points\_to\_gme\_shorts\_not\_having\_covered/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leorks/evidence_points_to_gme_shorts_not_having_covered/)) or counterfeit shares caused by naked shorting.

I’m an entrepreneur, not a finance expert, so I started doing some more digging on naked short selling to educate myself more on the subject. I started with this [https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm). “Failures to deliver may result from either a short or a long sale. There may be legitimate reasons for a failure to deliver. For example, human or mechanical errors or processing delays can result from transferring securities in physical certificate rather than book-entry form, thus causing a failure to deliver on a long sale within the normal three-day settlement period. **A fail may also result from “naked” short selling**.”

Interesting. We have a consistent and very high rate of FTIDs dating from 2020 and beyond, an indicator that the stock has potentially been naked shorted for a long time.

According to former Chairman of the SEC Christopher Cox, “Abusive **naked short sales... can be used as a tool to drive down a company's stock price** to the detriment of all of its investors. The Commission is particularly concerned about **persistent failures to deliver in the market** for some securities that may be due to loopholes in the Commission's Regulation SHO, adopted just two years ago… Selling short without having stock available for delivery, and **intentionally failing to deliver stock within the standard three-day settlement period, is market manipulation that is clearly violative of the federal securities laws**… We are particularly concerned about the potential negative effect that **substantial and persistent fails to deliver may be having on the market in some securities.** Specifically, these fails to deliver can deprive shareholders of the benefits of ownership - voting, lending, and dividends from issuers. Moreover, **they can be indicative of abusive naked short selling, which could be used as a tool to drive down a company's stock price**. (Source:[ https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/2006/spch071206cc2.htm](https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/2006/spch071206cc2.htm))

In a different speech Mr Cox re-iterated that short selling helps prevent "irrational exuberance and bubbles. But **when someone fails to borrow and deliver the securities needed to make good on a short position, after failing even to determine that they can be borrowed, that is not contributing to an orderly market – it is undermining it.”** Mr Cox also “referred to "the serious problem of abusive naked short sales” as “**a tool to drive down a company's stock price**" and that the SEC is "concerned about the persistent failures to deliver in the market for some securities that may be due to **loopholes in Regulation SHO**" (which reminds me of this piece I wrote [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leorks/evidence\_points\_to\_gme\_shorts\_not\_having\_covered/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leorks/evidence_points_to_gme_shorts_not_having_covered/)) (source for SEC Chairman’s words: [https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/2008/spch071808cc.htm](https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/2008/spch071808cc.htm))

As another datapoint, Robert J. Shapiro, former undersecretary of commerce for economic affairs has claimed that **naked short selling has cost investors $100 billion and driven 1,000 companies into the ground**. (Source: This was originally in a time magazine article from 2005 which was deleted[ https://time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1126706-3,00.html](https://time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1126706-3,00.html) but the statement still exists in record in an SEC Filing from 2008[ https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-08/s70808-170.htm](https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-08/s70808-170.htm))

I also read ‘**One complaint about naked shorting from targeted companies is that the practice dilutes a company's shares** for as long as unsettled short sales sit open on the books. This has been alleged to create "**phantom" or "counterfeit" shares**, sometimes going from trade to trade without connection to any physical shares, and **artificially depressing the share price’**”. Shortly after, I read that Matt Taibbi contended the use of naked shorting and counterfeit shares was the tactic used to help kill both Bear Sterns and Lehman Brothers. Taibbi said that the two firms got a "push" into extinction from "a flat-out counterfeiting scheme called naked short-selling". (Source:[ https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/story/30481512/wall\_streets\_naked\_swindle](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/story/30481512/wall_streets_naked_swindle))

All these sources above seem to support the theory that GME stock was wildly naked shorted, which put funds in the risk of being badly short squeezed. If investing on the basis of the extraordinarily high short interest percentage, GME was a prime candidate for a short squeeze to happen -- potentially even an infinite short squeeze. On 1/26 Elon tweeted about Gamestop and that was the day the stock entered the mainstream for a lot of people and retail investors began to really pile on to the stock outside of WSB. The goal of this was to push the stock price up and trigger a short squeeze, the theorized losers would be the funds that naked shorted and would be stuck in the squeeze.

On 1/28 Thursday when the stock had immense momentum from the moment pre-trading started (the stock shot up to 513 in pre-trading) and it looked like the squeeze was going to happen that day, the momentum was suddenly shut down when Robinhood (where many or potentially majority of retail investors were on) were shut off from the ability to buy GME stock and only allow selling, followed by several other brokers. Many believe this was a result of collusion and that this shut down allowed badly besieged hedge funds to close some positions while the public was shut out of buying (but funds were not.) When this happened people were upset at Robinhood suspecting it was a result of potential collusion between Robinhood and Citadel (which along with Point72 invested a lifeline of 2.5 billion to Melvin Capital, one of the short side funds, and is also responsible for something like 40% of Robinhoods entire revenue by buying their order books), but many also speculated collusion with DTCC itself. Now, personally speaking, its kind of crazy to think about DTCC being complicit in something like this. However, looking into the details of what happened, a skeptical part of me became suspicious.

Apparently what triggered the shut down on trading GME on that day was DTCC sending a letter at 4 am to Robinhood requiring them to come up with 3 billion dollars ([https://fortune.com/2021/02/02/robinhood-gamestop-restricted-trading-meme-stocks-gme-amc-vlad-tenev-nscc/](https://fortune.com/2021/02/02/robinhood-gamestop-restricted-trading-meme-stocks-gme-amc-vlad-tenev-nscc/)) . So it sounds like it was essentially this DTCC letter that led to the shut down of the momentum on GME and the short squeeze happening. On that day, there were theories thrown out that DTCC was potentially complicit in the naked short selling of GME and intentionally did this to stem the massive blow back/scandal if an infinite short squeeze did happen. Assuming the price of share of the price rocketed to 1000 or beyond (which would be likely in the event of a short squeeze or infinite short squeeze), hedge funds would likely go bankrupt as financially speaking there would be no way they would be able to cover all their shorts, and presumably entities that lent the short side hedge fund the shares to short would be holding the bag. Worse, DTCC would be exposed for being complicit in this entire thing, I imagine it would be an incredible scandal to say the least.

Then I read something that caught my eye… DTCC has had a history of being at the center and source of naked shorts. From an article dating back to 2007, “Depository Trust & Clearing Corp. is a little-known institution in the nation's stock markets with a seemingly straightforward job: It is the middleman that helps ensure delivery of shares to buyers and money to sellers. About 99% of the time, trades are completed without incident. But about 1% of the shares -- valued at about $2.5 billion on a given a day -- aren't delivered to the buyer within the requisite three days, for one reason or another. **These "failures to deliver" have put DTCC in the middle of a long-running fight over whether unscrupulous investors are driving down hundreds of small companies' share prices**.” (Source: [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118359867562957720](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118359867562957720))

Apparently the DTCC has been known to be allowing or complicit in this action for a very long time. According to Wall Street Journal “**There is no dispute that illegal naked shorting happens. The fight is over how prevalent the problem is -- and the extent to which DTCC is responsible**. Some companies with falling stock prices say it is rampant and blame DTCC as the keepers of the system where it happens. DTCC and others say it isn't widespread enough to be a major concern.” (Source: [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118359867562957720](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118359867562957720)).

"It has been alleged in **tens or hundreds of lawsuit**s that the DTCC and its **Prime Broker owners have abused their monopoly position to create numerous techniques that allow for the creation of counterfeit shares through naked shorting** that facilitate stock manipulation by hedge funds. Law suits have been brought against Merrell. Lynch, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan, UBS, other market makers and also the DTCC. The Prime Brokers and DTCC have fought back ferociously against these lawsuits with great success and **have been largely successful in blocking attempts to gain access to their transaction data bases. The information that they do release is incomplete, self-serving and misleading**. (Source: [https://smithonstocks.com/part-3-in-series-on-illegal-naked-shortings-role-in-stock-manipulation-prime-brokers-and-the-dtcc-have-a-troubling-monopoly-on-clearing-and-settling-stock-trades/](https://smithonstocks.com/part-3-in-series-on-illegal-naked-shortings-role-in-stock-manipulation-prime-brokers-and-the-dtcc-have-a-troubling-monopoly-on-clearing-and-settling-stock-trades/))

As a thought experiment, lets say naked shorting is rampant in GME (many many indicators point to this) and lets say DTCC was ultimately responsible for allowing a wide scale naked shorting campaign on GME, wouldn’t it be in their best interest to make sure this doesn’t get out and blow up in their faces? Something to consider. Because had they not done what they did on 1/28 Thursday, many traders believe the squeeze would’ve happened that day.

From the Wall Street Journal: “The Securities and Exchange Commission has viewed naked shorting as a serious enough matter to have made two separate efforts to restrict the practice. The latest move came last month, when the SEC further tightened the rules regarding when stock has to be delivered after a sale. But **some critics argue the SEC still hasn't done enough**… Some delivery failures linger for weeks or months. Until that failure is resolved, there are effectively additional shares of a company's stock rattling around the trading system in the form of the shares credited to the buyer's account, critics say. **This "phantom stock" can put downward pressure on a company's share price by increasing the supply… Critics contend DTCC has turned a blind eye to the naked-shorting problem.”** (source: [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118359867562957720](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118359867562957720))

From everything I’ve seen, as someone who has been an observer and a participant of this saga starting from 1/26, many things look very fishy and there are a lot of red flags people have documented. I personally hold the following hypothesis:

* GME shorts engaged in rampant naked shorting which lead to the short interest of the stock being 221% and 150% at various times, and as late as 1/28 reported by S3 to be 122% [https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355246955874701314](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355246955874701314)
* GME shorts potentially hid their positions via a loophole of generating synthetic longs ([https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leorks/evidence\_points\_to\_gme\_shorts\_not\_having\_covered/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leorks/evidence_points_to_gme_shorts_not_having_covered/)) and using those to “cover” their positions but not truly covering, which is illegal to cover using this particular method, and which has the effect of delaying the short needing to be closed, potentially betting on retail investors to lost interest and price to go back down before they truly close
* As a result of naked shorting a large amount of counterfeit shares are floating in the market leading to there being far more GME shares then the actual float
* The counterfeit shares can/have been used in [aggressive naked short attacks](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lf4vn3/yes_laddering_is_real_short_ladder_attack_is_just/) to further drive down the price of GME, which may have led to the precipitous price drop starting last Monday and which may have also been aided by if they were able to [artificially cover their shorts using synthetic long shares](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leorks/evidence_points_to_gme_shorts_not_having_covered)
* Due to the widespread naked shorting that all signs are pointing to, DTCC which has had history of being accused of turning a blind eye to naked shorts, may’ve turned a blind eye to the rampant naked shorting happening in GME
* There was potentially collusion on 1/28 to stop the short squeeze from happening whereby DTCC may be involved and may be implicated had the squeeze happened due to the position of naked shorts, it would have been an unbelievable scandal if exposed.

With the hearing coming up on February 18th, I highly recommend you email and tweet the representatives involved in the hearing, as well as your own district representatives, and urge them to read into the factors presented in this post and **call the DTCC and Prime Brokers to the hearing**l. **They need to be questioned on why GME has so many counterfeit shares, failed to deliver, their complicity in naked shorting, and investigated for their role in the retail shut down of 1/28.** Below are 4 members of congress I recommend both tweeting and emailing

**Edit: Matt Taibbi's rolling stone article is highly relevant and good reading on this subject** [**https://www.rollingstone.com/feature/wall-streets-naked-swindle-194908/**](https://www.rollingstone.com/feature/wall-streets-naked-swindle-194908/)**, so many parallels that the signs are hard to miss. Even if you've read it before, recommend reading it again. Shows me that if the hypothesis posed is true, Prime brokers are likely complicit. Prime brokers also happen to own the DTCC.**

**This brings up another interesting thought experiment: On 1/28 when the price was 450+ and shorts were likely under 100, if we assume prime brokers allowed naked shorting in GME, then when the squeeze was about to happen (or happening), if brokers margin called the shorts, they would presumably also go down because shorts would not be able to pay in that event and the brokers would be holding the bag. By that logic, they have every incentive in this case to NOT to margin call because doing would also taken them down and they would lose a lot of money. Instead the most logical option would probably be to make a backroom deal, which is what I personally think mostly likely happened.**

What Is a Cross Trade?

A cross trade is a practice where buy and sell orders for the same asset are offset without recording the trade on the exchange. It is an activity that is not permitted on most major exchanges.

Why is it important?

This is important for one particular stock that shan’t be named, because when you cross trade, it doesn’t affect the price of that particular stock.

Now what these traders are doing to beat the system is, they are buying stocks when the market is close, and sell those stocks when the market is open. Creating a massive negative pressure, when we plebs are looking at the price, but no effect when they are buying their stocks and we are asleep.

TLDR- Imagine a boat where you row forward every time you buy a stonk, and row backwards every time you sell. Now cross trade allows you to row in the water when you want the price to go down, and row in the air every time you are buying that stock you just sold to lower the price._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ What is the future of WSB? I miss what was left of the old WSB culture before 7 million new subscribers in a month obliterated it into some sort of virtual Occupy Wallstreet. 

I'm not trying to be a whiny bitch about it, but I think it's worth discussing where we go moving forward, or whether old WSB is just dead and we're at the whims of the overwhelming majority of fresh meat.

I see people who don't get the concept of yolo and think this is some sort of investing forum or collective get rich quick scheme, and sadists who think it's a place to *"egg people on into doing a stupid bet then laughing at the results"*.  Maybe I'm wrong, but to me none of that has ever been WSB.

I'm not trying to gatekeep the culture, I wasn't here at the start although I have been around on and off for more than 5 years, and I think of WSB as a place where we make or become market memes, and occasionally share an intelligent high risk bet, or the large gains/losses from one. 

A place where there's more discussion than *"I like the stock"* - often using leverage or options in ways that will lose a novice money. A place where money is taken lightly and no one is gambling their house even if they are putting hundreds of thousands on the line.

I don't really care if people want to keep holding Gamestop in hopes of triggering a short squeeze to a million, if they can do it that's fine, but there's no finesse to pressing the buy button on a stock and honestly it's kind of boring compared to past plays. DFV's play was interesting and WSB worthy because he came up with a thesis, had conviction and posted the results, and along the way he didn't just buy stock he also flipped options to make like $13+ million in addition to the stock he was holding. Excellent content.

I'm curious to hear what other people who have been around here for more than 6 months think as well. Is there any way to keep the old culture, is it a lost cause with so much new blood, or maybe you even like the new evolution of WSB?

TLDR: WSB got popular *womp womp*. Anyone up for a paper trading competition?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ GME: 'power' to the people who played themselves Yes, I sold GME on the way up. You might be angry with me. You have no right to be. I never signed up to be part of your movement. I couldn't think of a stupider method of trying to hurt Wall Street fatcats if I tried. Handing them briefcases full of your own cash would probably be more effective, because some of them would get caught by the IRS for not paying taxes on it.


##A Lesson that can be learned:

There's plenty of publicly available information that you should have read before YOLO-ing hard-earned money into a so-called 'movement'.

##This wasn't a story of the little guy versus the big bad hedge fund

(https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gme/institutional-holdings)

More than half of all GME stock is owned by institutions, such as Morgan Stanley, Blackrock, and State Street Corp. How are you going to stick it to the man when you're driving up the price of the stock that fucking Morgan Stanley owns? Please explain to me how this is a better idea for a social movement than donating money to a charity that helps poor people.


##You're deluding yourself on the value of the company.

(https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gme/insider-activity)

* GME insiders have disclosed **ZERO share purchases** in 2021.

* Ryan Cohen bought shares at **$15** in mid-December.

* All reported insider transactions in 2021 have been sales of shares, ranging from **$19 - $36.**

* Kurt Wolf, a Director of GameStop **sold 810,000** shares of GME on January 12/13th at **$19 - $30.**

Now please explain to me how you, a reddit user with a moderate amount of karma, can justify a price for GameStop that is higher than $36 per share. What do you know that the insiders who work for the company do not know? Please enlighten everyone about “cloud gaming” or whatever. Maybe call Kurt Wolf and explain it to him.

##People were horrible to Andrew Left

He's a douche. I get it. People were too mean to him though. People made it way too personal. It's fucking scary seeing you guys turn into a mob. Remember when Reddit tried to find the Boston Bomber, they accused the wrong guy, and he [censored by automod]? That was super fucked up. I'm glad nothing like that happened with Andrew Left, but you guys probably scared the shit out of his friends and family.

##Takeaway: Next time you see an angry, stupid mob trying to justify their greed as "a movement" tell them to fuck right off

But if you want to join a pump-n-dump while deluding yourself into believing that you're doing it for the greater good, then keep that shit to your fucking self because it's the stupidest thing I've ever heard.

##In closing, a wager

If GME goes to $500 by the end of February, I will drink my own piss.

https://www.umaryland.edu/news/archived-news/february-2021/umb-study-novavax-vaccine-demonstrates-strong-immune-response.php_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Uber FD DD... 50/50 So, I was just burned on Lyft and Uber puts because I didn’t do any DD and went in with just a ‘guess’ and ‘anecdotal’ evidence that they would have bad earnings and a larger loss than usual. So, I present to you my grappling at straws reversal. 


So Uber is the most well known ride sharing service with a market cap of $110 billion whilst still not being profitable despite many desperate  suggestions that they will turn a profit by the end of 2020. 
Uber has had a hard year as their revenue dipped 50% due to the virus and their losses tripled. They were hemorrhaging cash like always but more. And then they took the unprecedented step of selling their AI research division off. This has huge implications as from my understanding was their business model was to get a huge market share of the industry and then when autonomous vehicles are around it will enable robotaxis making them humongous profit.


This may seem bad but it’s very bullish. They sold it to start-up Aurora Technologies and will invest $400million giving it a 26% stake. This would be 10% of their revenue pre-covid and a much larger %age in these cash-strapped times. Though Uber has a very strong balance sheet dropping pre-covid from 10B to 6B in their most recent earnings - Q3 2020. This shows they are actually pushing to achieve profitability and may give a nice speech for earnings showing their bullish gameplan. 



UberEats was much less of a cash loss than Uber whilst still being a cash hole and during the pandemic this really shone through. Delivery rose 134% year on year. Also have you noticed their new ubereats fees such as the service fee? Bullish.



Ubers Q4 2020 earnings is after market close today and their EPS estimate is $-0.56. This is  huge expectation and I think it would be their most profitable earnings ever. Q1 2020 their EPS was -1.7 and Q4 2019 it was -0.63 - just pre-covid.
…
I’m not so bullish anymore but a FD is a FD. 



Lyft shares had an EPS of $-0.58 beating estimates of %-0.72 and they didn’t have the same opportunities such as fortifying their balance sheet by ‘selling’ their autonomous vehicle division or a profitable food delivery division.



Finally, I just want to make my money back and so this DD is just to justify myself and hope for the best. Pre-market prayer can start from now.

At  the very least we can stare at the daily short sale volumes that come  out each day.  Below, in italics, I've pasted information directly from [FINRA's website](https://www.finra.org/filing-reporting/trf/trf-regulation-sho-2020) that tells what we're actually looking at, and I **TLDR the paragraphs in bold** below because crayons are tasty. NOTE that my previous post I completely fucked up how I did afterhours short volumes using this same data, but everything here SHOULD BE CORRECT, as reported by FINRA.  And here's the [LINK TO MONTHLY SHORT SALE Files for FINRA](https://www.finra.org/filing-reporting/trf/trf-regulation-sho-2021) , whenever it actually comes up.

&#x200B;

*"  Pursuant to a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission request, FINRA   makes short sale trade data publicly available for off-exchange (OTC)   trades in exchange-listed securities reported to FINRA’s Alternative   Display Facility (ADF) .  FINRA makes two types of files available: (1)   Daily Short Sale Volume Files; and (2) Monthly Short Sale Transaction   Files (collectively, the Short Sale Files). "*

&#x200B;

* **Publicly traded stocks(GME on the NYSE) can be traded "upstairs" but have to be reported.**

&#x200B;

*"  The Daily Short Sale Volume Files provide aggregated  volume by  security for all short sale trades executed and  reported to a TRF, the  ADF, or the ORF during normal  market hours for public dissemination  purposes (i.e., media-reported trades).  There are individual files for   the volume associated with trades reported to each TRF (FINRA/Nasdaq  Chicago, FINRA/Nasdaq Carteret, FINRA/NYSE), the ADF, and the ORF.   There is also a file entitled "Consolidated TRF/ADF Daily Short Sale  Volume Files," which combines the volume for trades in exchange-listed  securities reported to the TRFs and the ADF.*"

&#x200B;

* **Daily Short Sales files only contain how many short sale trades were done that day.**

&#x200B;

*"The  Short Sale Files are not consolidated with exchange data. To obtain a   complete picture of the short sale volume to total volume for a   particular exchange-listed stock, market participants must combine data   from the separate files for each of the TRFs and the ADF, as well as   from each exchange. "*

&#x200B;

* **Short sale trades done on NYSE for instance, are NOT in these files**

&#x200B;

*"  The Short Sale Files do not—and are not intended to—equate to  bi-monthly  reported short interest position information. The short  interest data  reflects aggregate short positions held by market  participants at a  specific moment in time on two discrete days each  month, while the Daily  Short Sale Volume File reflects the aggregate  volume of trades executed  and reported as short sales on each trade  date. "*

&#x200B;

* **The GOOD STUFF is in the Monthly Short Sales files.**

&#x200B;

*" The* ***Short Sale Files exclude any trading activity that is not publicly disseminated.*** *As a result,* ***some offsetting buying activity related to reported short selling would not be reflected in the Daily Fil****e and may  result in the appearance of a higher concentration of short sale volume  to total volume. "*

&#x200B;

* **These files DO NOT contain everything from "upstairs" if they didn't report it!!!**

&#x200B;

So let's plot all the information available for 2021, from each of the daily short sales files.

I’ve noticed that barely anybody is talking about this stock even though they had multiple commercials during the superb-owl. 

ViacomCBS which owns - Nickelodeon, ⭐️BET, VH1, MTV, Comedy Central, C M T, and Paramount pictures

Is collabing with CBS which owns - Showtime, CBS access, and Sports ball (like NFL, NBA, College football championships, and the PGA Worldtour). 

To create their own streaming service. Disney + has already took all their content off of other streaming platforms and these services have the right to strip their content off Titans like Hulu and Netflix as well. 

Nickelodeon - has started their slime cam on NFL games to add their own cartoon touch to it. (yeah it’s corny, but it’s a nice twist) 

BET and C M T - have a select audience who would much rather pay for a streaming service then stay on cable tv to watch their programs.

VH1, MTV, Comedy Central - these channels are most of the older generations demographic and if they put old vintage content on there (MTV Cribs, Tosh.0, Beavis and butt-head) I see a lot of people wanting to relive those shows.

Paramount pictures - produced the Wolf of Wallstreet. I don’t even have to say anymore. 🚀🚀🚀🚀

CBS - is America’s most watched network for the 12th consecutive year. That means humans really like this TV guys.

I’m not saying this is a million dollar idea and im not a financial advisor. I just really like the stock and it’s potential is endless. Netflix is at $559 a share and I can easily see this one hitting $150 by the end of this year. 

Current status - $65 3/19 and looking to buy many more.

Edit : Accidentally deleted my post 😑_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Aphria Inc (APHA): my final post before merger 😮‍💨🥦🚀🚀🚀 Hello, some of you might know me from [my initial post before new year](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kn4wck/aphria_inc_apha_yes_its_cannabis_yes_its_about_to/) and [my follow-up post two weeks later](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kwiuyl/aphria_inc_apha_blue_america_and_free_tendies/).  I suggest you guys read those first, because I won't repeat earlier points I've made in other posts. I'm here to give you guys a final Aphria headsup before merger. I won't post again before merger, because I think this is the final moment to buy into APHA before merger at a reasonable price. Next post will be about gains after merger.

# Introduction (another look back)

Well, well, well. I have to take you guys back to the beginning. After a long time lurking, the Aphria posts were my first DD posts on this subreddit. What a journey that has been. I have to remind you guys that before [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k450e6/why_apha_is_set_for_a_50_gain/) by [u/WatAb0utB0b](https://www.reddit.com/user/WatAb0utB0b/) after they acquired Sweetwater, basically nobody on this sub was talking about Aphria. Then I made my post after the merger announcement, still almost nobody else was talking about it and I was laughed at (again a shout-out to the guy that advised me to buy an Xbox instead of APHA). When people saw the gains come in after the senate turned blue and I made my follow-up post, some people finally took notice (although still not a lot). And here we are right at this very moment, the entire subreddit is currently talking about it. 

I know my DD probably wasn't the most best/detailled you guys will ever read. But I'd still like to think that my initial post inspired some others to buy APHA or do their own DD. I'd like to imagine some dude YOLO'd his life savings into it when he read my post and that person is sitting in Hawaii right now sipping on some coconut milk, getting his cock sucked by a hooker named Stacy and enjoying his life. That feeling is exactly why I am writing this last DD post for you retards right now. Hopefully everyone reading this post will listen to me now and I can make some more of you autists rich.

# There's no denying it: Cannabis market heading back to 2018 levels

I told you guys before, once the good news rally begins then we were going to head for the moon because of the volatility of cannabis stocks. This is exactly what happened. Cannabis will undoubtedly be federally legalized in the USA now. There might be minor political obstructions, but there's no stopping the general movement. Once the American legalization movement is done, it will probably also influence European regulators. Cannabis stock should be a part of your portfolio at this point. If it isn't already, let me give you another couple of reasons why.

**It's not about the joints, it's about the CBD oil.** Let's be honest: to most people cannabis will still be seen as an addicting drug you should avoid because of the years that regulators spent demonizing it. You know which product doesn't suffer from a bad image? CBD motherfucking oil, I would even say it has a very positive image. Most people probably think about it like this: joints = junkees in the park getting high, CBD oil = people suffering from cancer relieving their pain. Its healing effects might be scientifically doubted, that doesn't change the general consensus about the product.  
You should even think past the direct 'healing' effects, CBD oil is becoming a popular supplement for regular people. People will be buying drinks, food, even fucking shampoo with CBD oil in it. The market for it is the most promising across all cannabis products, because it is the most likely to become popularised throughout North America and also be partially legalized in countries that still ban marihuana (EU mostly). Growth estimates currently are that the total CBD oil market should roughly quintuple by 2025.

**Markets are fucking insane right now, cannabis mania 2.0 is inevitable.** I don't have to tell you guys about it. This is the ideal investing climate for the cannabis market to go bonkers again, except this time there is actually nothing holding it back. The naysayers have no valid arguments against cannabis anymore like they had in 2018. There is absolutely a bubble blowing up right at this moment, so I quote old pal George Soros: "The first thing I do when I notice a bubble is invest more". The bubble isn't popping anytime soon people. Green energy, EV, cannabis: all these markets have very positive futures ahead of them. Cannabis might even be a long term hold this time around, can you guys believe it? The stock that has been memed so hard and struggled their way through the last couple of years is finally a worthy boomer investment. Praise the lord, Amen.

# Aphria/Tilray merger arbitrage: TLRYtards are missing out

**There is no reason to pick Tilray over Aphria. There, I said it.** I talked all about the possible arbitrage in my previous post, but here is a small summary. Aphria and old Tilray are merging to new Tilray. Aphria will get a 62% stake in new Tilray, old Tilray will get a 38% stake. To account for this split, Aphria owners will receive 0.8381 shares for each APHA share they own. Tilray stock holders will not see any changes to their holdings. There is arbitrage/free tendies because the APHA to TLRY ratio is lower than 0.8381. The only risks are (1) the merger doesn't go through or (2) the split/ratio is adapted to Aphria's detriment, both seem highly unlikely because the merger was already publicly announced. 

Back then APHA to TLRY ratio was 0.67 and it has even worsened to roughly 0.57 at this moment. I've seen other people post about this, but they are missing something. As we move closer and the specific merger date is announced, the APHA to TLRY ratio will undoubtedly move to 0.8381 so TLRY must fall or APHA must skyrocket by that date. The thing others are missing in their DD's is from the point you buy APHA, the matter if the APHA to TLRY split corrects itself doesn't matter to you personally anymore. All you have to do is compare YOUR buy-in price with the Tilray price. As long as that ratio is below the merger ratio of 0.8381, you will profit from the merger. It's as simple as that.

**TLDR:** Cannabis = arguably best growth market for the near future or long term. Aphria = best candidate in the market because of APHA/TLRY merger. APHA to TLRY price ratio doesn't match with merger agreement = free tendies, no reason to pick Tilray. This is IMO the last time to buy in for a reasonable price.

**Positions:** I still have my measily 30 shares @ $8.74 that I've been holding since the start of December. If GME squeezes before the merger and I finally decide to cash in, I will probably buy more._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Many of you have been easily manipulated, take a good look at what's happening around you There are lots of posts calling out all of the naysayers and ninnies that are obviously plants sent here to stir up chaos. Clearly it's working in all kinds of forms - there are certainly people folding and falling prey, but to what extent, who knows. There are posts that are manipulative on all kinds of levels, from careful timing of GME gain porn in the millions, to straight trash talk to GME holders, even posts on other subreddits trash talking GME holders. Anyone that's been here a while knows this kind of trash talk especially isn't normal or okay, it's not what we're about. We LOVE when people fuck up and lose a bunch of money, it's a fucking celebration, not a witch hunt. So what is a lone ape in a scary crowded jungle to do? Think about your situation. A large hedge fund vs. Reddit army story was shot out into the public. Mysteriously, buying ability was cut before the projected timing of the squeeze on social media. Shortly after, there were many warning posts of the remaining dirty tactics that we would face in the coming weeks, the serious manipulation, and the fact that it would realistically work on a lot of people. Mark Cuban stopped by, gave us some sweet tips, and warned us that very likely they think they're smarter than us & kept shorting. We are now in those coming weeks, and we are being mercilessly invaded with BS. This clearly indicates that there is an active effort to manipulate our users, which is a sign to me that we are on the path to doing some damage, and who else would target this community in this way? They have picked their side of this tug of war. Now, what side have others picked? Ask yourself this - if you were ANOTHER hedge fund right now, or any wealthy individual who dabbles in investing, would you jump on the short train and try to bankrupt Gamestop, kick back and watch, or buy GME? You are all out here looking like fools if you think the rich people that AREN'T shorting GME aren't trying to jump on this fucking money rocket. These people are rich for a reason, they are playing fucking 4D chess on y'all stupid fucks while you pick your nose and can't remember why you bought the stock you literally bought two fucking weeks ago. You have doubts now because your 30 year old neighbor who invests in bonds made a comment about how loaded you'd be if you sold at $400. Stay strong in your resolve, take note of the clues around you, and remember what convinced you this was a good decision in the first place. Unless you're a mouth breathing humanoid who just wanted to 10x their pathetic life savings instantly and bought in without reading more than three sentences, in which case, you're probably in the right place so just shut the fuck up for a while until this blows over. 

This is not financial advice I kinda just like the stock.  

🚀🚀🚀

tl;dr - there are a lot of other people/hedge funds that invest money that aren't active on WSB or currently shorting GME, and they've probably put some thought into how they can most profit off of this situation based on actual analysis. I'm not one of those smart guys but it seems like usually the answer where more rich people get richer is how it goes.

EDIT: I've been looking at users tonight and noticed there are seemingly bots that got in early enough to pretend to be in on the hold, all just to make it even more convincing when they decide to sell. There are also bots offering to pay redditors to post about selling GME, and maybe redditors are taking the bribe even if they aren't selling in true WSB degenerate fashion.

2nd rule of wallstreetbets is that wallstreetbets is NOT an investment subreddit  


I've been subbed and unsubbed from this subreddit about a thousand times. I've lurked for years. I've posted. I've commented. The number of times that I've seen the term bagholder in the past 6 years I could count on one hand. The number of times I've seen the term bagholder in the past week would rival my loss porn in zimbabwean dollars.  


Wallstreetbets is NOT an investment subreddit. Bagholding is what happens when you make a good investment, get greedy and miss the window of opportunity to cash in your investment. I can't be a bagholder because I wasn't ever investing.  


I'm a gambler. This subreddit is for high risk high reward gambles particularly ones that occur with stocks, options, and trades. If I buy a stock and hold on to it as it falls to the ground, then plunges through the ground, then winds up in Satan's basement it's not because I was bag holding. It's because I made an epic gamble and the gamble lost.  


This subreddit for the longest time has never had gains as it's highest priority. The honor has always been reserved for the highest %change. It's always been about taking risks. And it loves to see a high %loss just as much as a high %gain.  


DFV isn't a hero because he put 13 million dollars into his pocket. He's a fucking hero because he dumped 50,000 into a deep OTM call. For months he lost money. Crazy amounts of money in fact. And you know what, he held. And this subreddit loved to see his losses. He's a hero because he held onto the ball long after most people would have sold.  


But if the 4 million new people on this sub had logged in May of 2020, they'd all be talking about DFV as a "bagholder".  


If you use the term bagholder, you don't understand this sub. Go elsewhere. Go to r/investing. Buy an index fund. Collect some dividends and set them up for reinvestment. But don't come here and pretend that you know shit about shit. You don't even know the fucking language, let alone the culture._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ TLRY, APHA recap and future speculation I posted a few months ago back when tilray and aphria were in the 10-15$ range about the future outlook for what we could see later this year and I made the prediction that it would pass 50$ (currently 48) later in the year... boy was my timeframe wrong, several sweetheart government deals from major countries has catapulted tilray up massively and this has been overlooked since we have had the gamestop run.
I am asking the community if there is any new information that might be out there and to compile it so we can make the next move informed.

I also heard tilray is shorted 50% but dont know how true this is.


I locked in 1400$ on a 100$ call and I am looking for my next bet; if i dont just purchase shares.

The above tweets caused a shit storm around S3. People claiming that they were fudging numbers, got a call from Citadel, and that they changed the way they report SI to be sneaky. Here's some additional tweets by both S3 and Ihor (who works at S3) that objectively show that they have always been consistent with how they report short interest.

They have always reported SI % AND SI S3 %. They have always stated that the former is the traditional and the latter is their method which prevents the percentage from being over 100%. These above tweets are just limited to GME. You can browse their tweets over a variety of other stocks and see the same method of reporting.

Tl:dr My belief is that even though there should be a correction, and the market is super inefficient and broken, it's probably not gonna shit the bed 'til the Fed stops going Brrrr.

To consider as a bear thesis.

&#x200B;

1. Every 5-7 years there is a significant correction. Save a quickly recovered Covid crash we're on year 12. 87-91, 91-98, 98-2003, 2003-2008, 2008-Now?
2. Last time PE ratios were this high (2008) they crashed back down. Previous was the dot com bust.
3. Today's Volume was stupidly low, which is concerning.
4. It wouldn't be a stretch to say we're in a mania phase of a bubble.  Look at all the new 'dumb' money pouring in.
5. The economy doesn't "feel" healthy, the divide between rich and poor is getting worse, real unemployment is high, no definitive end in sight for the covid-pocolypse.

&#x200B;

Then all the contrary stuff.

1. We're on QE (some fucking high number). The Fed is going Brrr, has been going brrr, and doesn't look like they are gonna stop going brrrr.
2. Along with going Brrr they are keep rates super low, which means there isn't a place to put money other than stonks.
3. Yellen has been fed chair during booms, and doesn't wanna fuck up her rep. She's more concerned with unemployment than inflations, which means she's gonna keep going brrr, and she's Keynseyan AF.
4. Biden et al probably don't want to be seen as responsible for a market crash, and I don't know how much longer they have to let it crash where they can say it's from Trumps policies.
5. Maybe the March covid-crash was enough for the steam to be let off, even though it was temporary AF.

&#x200B;

Grantham is generally bearish, and he's saying he expects early summer correction. [https://www.gmo.com/americas/research-library/waiting-for-the-last-dance/](https://www.gmo.com/americas/research-library/waiting-for-the-last-dance/)

[Finra - AMC](http://finra-markets.morningstar.com/MarketData/EquityOptions/detail.jsp?query=126:0P00011H0G) \-- **Short Interest**: 15.70 (some people have reported that it's not updating for them and they still see 38.12)

[WSJ - AMC](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/AMC) \-- **Short interest** **% of Float:** 66.06






**Edit 1:** As a post mentioned earlier today, Citadel has lied before about their short interest data. There is a small fine of, like, $149,000 for doing so. Paying the fine could save them billions of dollars, so it's possibly that all of the data is completely inaccurate.

**Edit 2:** Stop commenting that it's old data. We were waiting for data for the 29th. The reports are behind. This is the data that came out today, I assure you.

**Edit 3:** I usually use Fintel, not Finra, but I don’t think some of the people commenting are right in assuming the Short Interest on Finra is the % of the float. Short interest ≠ Short Interest % of Float. They are different. Some other posts that recently updated are just throwing a % sign on there and saying it's % of float

**Edit 4:** Hedge funds, if you're reading this right now, go fuck yourself.

**Edit 5:** I’ve got about 750 shares of GME and a little over 8,000 AMC. I’m holding both. The discrepancies in the data across all these sites is all you need to know. To the moon 🚀🌒_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Disney ($DIS) Earnings (iChing, Horoscope, Tarot) **$DIS**

Current price (6:32 pm, February 9, 2021): $188.80

IPO price (09:30 am, November 12, 1957): $13.88 ($128.66 in 2021 dollars)

For my first query regarding Disney's stock price, I consulted the iChing - an ancient Chinese divination method that involves flipping 3 coins 6 times in order to form a hexagon based on their results (i.e. heads or tails).

The upper trigram of this query was Gen, while the lower trigram was Kun, giving us the result of 23. According to [divination.com](https://divination.com), this means ["Splitting Apart.](https://divination.com/iching/lookup/23-2/)"

Key takeaways: 

I don't believe we need to take "Splitting apart" literally, as in indicating a stock split. The bottom line of the iChing reading indicates the need for patience and bravery, which to me is a bearish signal. We may have to wait longer for parks to open, or earnings may not be as good as expected.

If we are to believe positively in the executive leadership of the Disney Corporation, then the second line indicates a willingness to change. I take this as a signal that they are pivoting to focus on direct to consumer revenue streams such as Disney+.

The third line clearly indicates the announcement of a partnership - or perhaps the ending of one. We will see on Friday.

The fourth line references to the misfortunes Disney has faced in the pandemic, but gives us hope that these times are coming to an end.

The fifth could indicate many different things. I feel that it could either be a positive signal relating to the pandemic coming to a swifter than expected end (positive vaccine news?) or it could indicate a growing dissatisfaction with political and other forces hampering Disney's business model.

The sixth line is absolutely bullish. I expect very positive forward guidance based on the iChing reading.

**Horoscope for Friday, February 11, 2021**

**DISNEY SUN: SCORPIO**

**DISNEY MOON: CANCER**

Data source : [Cafe Astrology](https://cafeastrology.com/scorpio-daily-horoscope-day-after-tomorrow.html)

Key takeaways:

"Today's New Moon occurs when Venus aligns with Jupiter in your solar fourth house, dear Scorpio. It's a beautiful time for feeling warmth or a **feeling of abundance**."

"It's a time for emphasizing cooperation, trust, and faith."

"It can also be an excellent time to clear space around the home. Whether you're going bigger or creating the illusion of more space, it feels good. "

"There can be nice progress on a long-term project."

"You might enjoy fond memories or activities that focus on comfort and familiarity."

"You're inclined to make meaningful changes that enhance your current \[...\] arrangements."

"Avoid acting on impulse, and instead, focus on learning about your true needs."

To the WSBer reading this, it may seem bullish. But if you happen to be a member of Disney's board, I advise you to look at that last line and make sure that the decisions you are making as a company are good for the company as a whole. Avoid short-sightedness and rushing into things.

Predictions based on the horoscope: Bullish. Partnership. Scaling down parts of the business that are no longer profitable. New project announcement. Something tantalizing about the parks and cruises reopening.

**Tarot**

I only drew one card, the [Upright Magician](https://randomtarotcard.com/TheMagician.jpg).

[Keywords](https://labyrinthos.co/blogs/tarot-card-meanings-list/the-magician-meaning-major-arcana-tarot-card-meanings): willpower, desire, being resourceful,, skill, ability, concentration, manifestation

This is an incredibly bullish card for $DIS. 

"There can be increased financial opportunities available right now, you’ll likely just need to pursue them with gusto. The magician works with many tools to make his will manifest."

**Random Number \[1,300\]** (courtesy of [Random.org](https://Random.org))

**292**

According to [this website](https://www.sunsigns.org/angel-number-292-meaning/), this number symbolizes getting insight and understanding in order to solve pressing problems. Note that is also in the 97th percentile of possible numbers. I interpret this as bullish on Disney's stock price and forward guidance.

**Conclusion**

Disney is going to blow out earnings and the stock price is going to skyrocket.

Positions: I have no position in $DIS

oh shit my bad- .02 GME shares @ 500 still holding....I think💎👐💎👐💎🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀


Edit: I am a long time wsber whose looking to get things back to normal. It seems the GME gang is just really really lost....._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Robinhood Cancelling Brokerage Transfers!? On 2/4 I initiated a brokerage transfer from my Robinhood account to a new Fidelity account. Today I received an email from Robinhood saying my account was "unlocked." I had not interacted with my Robinhood account at all since a few days before I initiated the transfer (to make sure everything would settle after downgrading to a "cash" account). After 2 hours on hold with Fidelity today, they told me Robinhood had rejected the transfer. The reason they gave was that I had margin on my account. The problem is, I had already followed a redditor's advice and had downgraded my account to a cash account days before. I had made sure everything had settled before I initiated the transfer. 

Now, in Robinhood's app, I no longer can find the option to disable instant deposit/margin. It seems they've hidden/buried it further. This is absolutely unacceptable. 

Has this happened to anyone else? This is going to end up locking my account for an additional 2 weeks at least due to their shenanigans. I'm still holding some GME, as well as other assets I don't want to sell due to a taxable event. Does anyone have any advice?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ All you people hard coping with GME right now. Stop making shit up and instead help the company. Ortex isnt wrong S3 isnt wrong Finra isn't wrong. The squeeze was squoze. stop coming in here with the Q anon GME anon bullshit. Fuck out of here with that garbage. No you arent smarter than Ortex and S3 and understand the market better you fucking 3 week investing mongoloid.

Instead of making shit up to cope why don't you hop on the actual GME DD that occurred here before you tiny brain apes tried to take over.

Ryan Cohen is at the helm of this dying company. YES its a dying company that's why its a high risk high reward play. Could cohen fail? Yes he could and the company could go bankrupt. Do I think it will happen? Not at all especially with this free marketing.

People were doing amazing DD before your screaming drowned them out. Calling gamestop and finding out some stores are shifting into Gamestops 1.5 focused on building pc's and build a pc kiosks.

If you want to make your money back keep it in GME and talk about the upsides and bring actual conversation to the table. Make your voices heard to gamestop management you want them to involve pc building. I think bundling game pass and a built pc at gamestop is a great way to take share away from steam give it to Microsoft and build some capital for gamestop to utilize.

Give feedback on the app, what is easy and hard to use. Join the powerup Pro rewards program. BUY STUFF FROM GAMESTOP. 

Gamestop has a chance to actually be a 20-40B company if they get a stranglehold on pc parts. they have the ability to beat CyberpowerPC and IbuyPower because they can afford lower margins for prebuilt pc's with their already set up distribution centers. They can open stores in all the areas microcenter doesn't exist. Microcenter does 2.5B in revenue with only 25 stores countrywide. that's insane!

Desktop PC market is 8 Billion yearly revenue. Bro that's a lot of market share they can chip away at. 

Seriously stop looking at SI and making up shit to cope and actually help the company turn around to save your investment. GME can be $500 naturally in 5 years with a hardcore turnaround and some of that cohen customer satisfaction up his sleeves. Gamers are sluts for being treated well and cohen specializes in that._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ My fear and lack of self trust attributed to me missing out on the TSLA, CRSP, UAV, and GME booms. Don't be like me; find your passion, do your due diligence, and ride it to the moon.🚀🚀📈🚀📈🚀⭐ Back in March I had 10k(ish) that I was considering throwing down multiple avenues, yet my fear of losing it all drove me to be complacent with what I had and just keep saving. Now, I've got 20 grand in hand; nothing more nothing less, just 20. I have a special ed forces talent (the same one that I see inside of some of you) that could have net me 100's of racks within the year had I believed in myself, yet I blew it by "playing it safe". Don't be like me lads. If you have a dream, chase it! Either you'll go to the stars and be happy that you tried or you'll end up back on earth and lose a bit of money that could be made back in a year. Don't let your dreams be dreams, turn your dreams into memes so that you can laugh about how successful you've become.

*this is not financial advice, as I am not a financial advisor. Just a skinny 🦧 who wishes he had more 🍗 to eat.*

Edit: While this ALSO isn't financial advice, it is my opinion and I'd like to make it clear. Please don't trade with anything that you absolutely can't afford to lose, if you have to choose between taking care of necessities/eating and investing then you genuinely shouldn't be investing until you're in a better position financially. Cut back on some frivolous expenditures for a few paychecks/months to build a "start up fund" if you REALLY want to get started guilt free, don't go throwing your rent into a $rope in the hopes of being able to get next months rent free._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ I WANT TO GET OFF MR. BONES' WILD RIDE! _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ About that Finra report. Edit: And for everyone wondering, I was in no way implying that ortex, s3, etc. are misreading the fucking data.  My bad for inputting the morningstar link, I was editing the post before posting and changing how I was expressing things and didn't remove it.  It has been removed.
  
I was flat out stating that people HERE are going to look at the finra data and read it wrong, seeing potentially higher concentration of short to volume and also not realizing it's a snapshot at a specific time and long sales the same day could mean that there's more short sales reported than there were short positions created, when all is said and done.  

  
  
Taken directly from https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/notices/information-notice-051019  
Found by going to the short interest reporting page here  
https://www.finra.org/filing-reporting/regulatory-filing-systems/short-interest  
and going to notices and clicking on the top one, which is the newest one  
  
I believe everyone here, from what I've seen, is just looking at the number on the report and say OMG LOOK AT THAT SHORT INTEREST!
  
  
The notice from Finra, however, says that is not an accurate way to read the data.  Bolding of key points below is mine.  
  
FINRA believes that the following three key points about the short sale volume data may help market participants better understand and draw informed conclusions about the data. As discussed below, the data: **(1) does not include any trades that are not publicly disseminated, (2) is not consolidated with exchange data, and (3) does not—and is not intended to—equate to short interest position information.**  
  
  
Keys to Understanding Short Sale Volume Data  
First, as noted above, the data in the Short Sale Files includes only trades that are publicly disseminated and excludes trades that are not publicly disseminated. **As a result, some offsetting buying activity related to reported short selling would not be reflected in the Daily File and may result in the appearance of a higher concentration of short sale to total volume.**  
  
A common example is where a firm is facilitating a customer order to sell long. The firm may elect to first sell an equivalent number of shares from its own trading account to another firm and then purchase the shares from the customer at the same price to fill the outstanding long sale order. Trading in this manner reduces risk for the firm by enabling it to manage its inventory and lock in a price for the customer execution. Although this trading model involves two separate trades—one between the two firms and one between the firm and its customer—the two offsetting trades are executed at the same price to fill a single customer order. Thus, FINRA rules provide for the public dissemination of only one of the trades (the trade between the two firms) so as not to overstate the reported volume.5 If the firm facilitating the customer long sale order has either no position or a short position in the security in its trading account, the trade with the other firm is reported as short and included in the short sale volume calculations in the Daily File. The volume associated with the firm’s purchase from its customer, however, is not reflected in the Daily File. Thus, the firm’s short sale is included in the short sale volume calculations without any indication that it is associated with an offsetting purchase to facilitate a customer long sale.  
  
Second, as noted above, the data is published separately by FINRA for each FINRA trade reporting facility and by each exchange, and is not consolidated. **Thus, to obtain a complete picture of short sale volume to total volume in a particular listed stock, market participants must combine data published by FINRA for each of its trade reporting facilities, as well as data published by the exchanges.**6  
  
For example, suppose that for security ABCD, FINRA published a combined short sale volume of 3,000 shares and total volume of 15,000 shares for all of its trade reporting facilities.7 Viewing only this off-exchange data published by FINRA, the percentage of short sale volume to total volume would appear to be 20%. Suppose, however, that there was also activity for ABCD executed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) that day totaling 125,000 shares, of which 12,000 shares were reported as short. This volume is published by NYSE on its website, separate from the volume published by FINRA. When considered together, the overall percentage of short sale volume to total volume for ABCD that day is 10.7%, which is much lower than the data published on the FINRA website would suggest.  
  
FINRA notes that the SEC has a webpage where market participants can find links to the short sale volume data published by FINRA and the exchanges,8 which may facilitate consolidation of the data and provide market participants a more complete picture. However, some exchanges charge a fee for access to their data.9  
  

Finally, **short sale volume data does not—and is not intended to—equate to reported bi-monthly short interest information.** FINRA rules require firms to report, on a per security basis, the total quantity of shares held as short positions in all customer and proprietary firm accounts twice a month. FINRA publishes the short interest data for OTC equity securities on its website, while the data for listed stocks is published by the exchange on which the stock is listed. **Although some websites redistribute the Daily File and refer to the data as “short interest,” it is not, in fact, the equivalent of reported short interest information.**  
  
**Some market participants mistakenly conclude that the bi-monthly short interest data is understated because the Daily File reflects short sale volume that is much larger than what is reported as short interest. However, short interest data reflects short positions held by market participants at a specific moment in time on two discrete days each month, while the Daily File reflects the aggregate volume of trades executed as short sales on each trade date. Therefore, while the two data sets are related (i.e., short sale volume may ultimately result in a reportable short interest position), they are not necessarily correlated.**  
  
For example, if a firm sells short 1,000 shares of security ABCD, then purchases 1,000 shares of ABCD later the same day, the short sale volume in the Daily File will include the 1,000 shares that were sold short. Because the firm sold short and purchased an equivalent number of shares that day, it did not establish or accumulate a short position in ABCD; thus, its short sale has no impact on the reported short interest in ABCD._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Do I qualify as a real retard yet? &#x200B;

**So I'm basically new to the sub.** I was one of the insurgents who flopped into WSB after catching wiffs of sweet nothings, flung my dolla billz into the swirling vortex, and have been lurking/casually participating in this sub over the past few weeks now.

One thing I see is an endless amount of people talking about their losses on 10 shares of AMC or 2 shares of GME. **I'm down a little over 7k on AMC and GME alone right now AND I KNOW THIS IS ROOKIE SHIT.**

In the spirit of the WSB I've only been able to get wiffs of a long-passed fart from, here is my contribution of soft-core loss porn.

Gotta respect the home you barged in to.  


**edit**: Retard confirmation. Can't read good. "*losses of more than $2,500 or $10,000 USD for options or stocks respectively*." Apparently I don't understand the word respectively.

&#x200B;_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ GME squeeze has been squoze? I believe so... for now. I am of the opinion that many of the HFs have covered their short positions. This was more or less confirmed by the NYSE short interest report published today.

As seen [here](https://imgur.com/gallery/iZE8xhq) short interest dropped from 132% to 46% from Jan-15 to Jan-29. (EDIT: short percent of freefloat dropped from 132% to 46%)

I pulled out of GME to stop the bleeding (I know, paper hands). I entered at 321.

Since I have made some money back on GME puts. The short interest report published today is a bearish indicator if you were planning on holding out for short squeeze. I'm sorry to say that a short squeeze is less likely than before. It's unlikely that we will reach the same highs as before unless shorts double down again. We will have to keep an eye on the short interest for the foreseeable future.

For now, bearish sentiment around GME is indicated by the [2.78 put/call ratio](https://fintel.io/ss/us/gme).

Today I placed an order after hours for a GME $50 put expiring on 2/19. Not financial advice.
