 What is your GME play this week? Greetings team,

as you are aware, 12/8 is the day when GME is expected to release quarterly results. 51% of analysts believe they will beat the earnings, significant volumes of puts for 20$ have been bought on November 31st expiring December 18th, Friday. I have a position at 16$ and deliberate whether to dump it before earnings and avoid possible losses or try to ride it out and see if this short squeeze indeed happens.

Curious to hear what are you guys planning to do if you have shares within current share-price range?

Thanks!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Entering Into ARKK I’ve been wanting to enter into a position into ARKK for a while now. But the price seems to be at an ATH. With Tesla getting added to the S&P and prices most likely getting pushed up, I’m wondering if it would be prudent to get in now or wait until after all the hype has died down. 

I know lump sum usually beats DCA if you have the money on hand._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ EV news EU Came across this while reading the news, wanted to share it. Nothing very special.

The European Union wants 30 million electric cars to drive on European roads for more than ten years. This is stated in a document that the EU is expected to officially release next week. Brussels also wants high-speed trains to be used twice as much in ten years' time as now.

I’m from Europe (Poland to be exact) and as my stock app I’ve been using Plus500. And recently they just add a expiry date to my position and when I bought this stock there wasn’t a expiry date. Also this overnight funding is getting very expensive. So I would like to ask what other apps would you suggest for me that doesn’t have those payments or has maybe lower? Thanks in advance!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ NIO went from $2.7 to $50 in 7 months As you can see on this graph:

Living in China, I knew that this would be a player in the EV scene. It's not really that popular, but with the trade war and all it had a surge in sales. I just wonder, did any of you make big gains with this, knowing beforehand how it would play out? And if so, let me know what, how, and when you found out.

I feel it's a success Hollywood story in the making. If you invested your life savings in this basic penny stock back in the day you'd be set for life.

Note: NIO is still not anywhere near a market leader here. Chinese people either but Tesla, Lexus, a big German brand or some cheap Chinese model for a car. They don't really trust the new EV car scene as much as you think._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Using money for taxes in the stock market I’m a freelancer, so I pay my taxes in full every April. The year prior I put 30% away into a savings account and let it sit there. 

Is their anything inherently risky, (other than the obvious, the market 1929 style crashing) with investing the money that I have to pay every year in April, into the stock market. 

Not trying to GeT rIcH with WSB. But simply investing this money into a few sound companies that continuously have their stocks increase, such as Apple for example. 

Then when tax season comes around I take out what I owe the IRS, this way I still have my money making money for me rather than sitting in my savings account making me .03% interest. 

I guess I’m just looking for pros and cons, aside from the obvious of a market crash._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Q: Short positions If i short a stock, i borrow the shares from someone who has bought them, pay a bit of interest, sell them, but lets say that said person i borrowed shares from decides to take them back due to a short term market catastrophe, will my position be refilled if there is short floats available on the market?

I have been trading for 9 months- and wanted to share my experience for all those trying to navigate this different world. This is for people like me-- no experience in finance, interested in learning and growing knowledge, and starting out with no knowledge. 

My background- Registered nurse in a hospital. I have no affiliations or interests in this post that are to sway anyone. I am posting this because I started out by investing time and lots of mistakes, and if I can help another newbie navigate in this community. 

Initial Investment in march: $3000  Current balance: $6200 

Platform: Webull. I chose it by recommendation of a coworker, and I personally like it but I have nothing to compare it to as its the only one I have used. I do like the afterhours trading ability. 

Just a few of many things I have learned.....

1. Be skeptical of many if not most posters on forums. I went in naive, small town gal who believes in good-- that "wow all these people must be right with their recommendations!" I now take it lightly, note the ticker and do my due diligence.   I make sure to look at post history of anyone involved in stock discussions. I ignore anyone tagging multiple tickers, in fact block so they don't clog feeds. 
2. Keep a notebook. I write down terms when involved with a discussion that I don't understand to help me further my knowledge. For example, A stock I am investing that I feel will be doing very well very soon-- a discussion had multiple mentions of warrants. So I added to my definition list and went on to understand the companys warrents, what they were and why it is a factor in decisions. I write down definitions, terms I want to research in the future, lists of tickers I want to research, patterns I start to see in certain stocks-- its my little bible.
3. Beware of some (maybe most) of the big pumpers. I learned this watching a notable twitter pumper that people treat like a god. You will and can make money of their suggestions-- but can also get severly burned. They buy in a stock they know just needs volume to make it go. It can be something that is junk. So they buy a ton of shares really cheap-- then pump it so a massive volume influxes it-- however by the time they post the pump its already gone up a little--- the pumper has made his money and exited and you are stuck when the stock drops rapidly due to exits. I say this with admitting you can be smart and make a couple bucks-- but it also comes with risk.... and ethically its a little gross. I saw this notable pumper brag yesterday about a stock he made 800k off of-- and his kingdom of followers are why. So I post this with caution as yes they can get you in the right direction-- but they use you to do it, and it comes at a cost to many people. I have found a few posters who I follow that post facts and always see posts by people as just a start- and its my duty to follow up. 
4. Read SEC filings. The website is easy to search, and this will keep you up to date on the companys stock filings. I am still learning and understanding the significance of each document.
5. Find reputable due diligence. I am still developing this skill but so far I read SEC filings, I read releases from the company, history of the company. Websites I navigate are otcmarkets, investor hub, and business news sites. 
6. FOMO is huge in the market. I made so many mistakes my first month jumping into a stock by letting people pumping make me believe if I didn't buy it right that minute I would be left behind. This is absolutely wrong. I notate a stock I am interested in, and I watch its patterns. I look at the spread of buy ins too, to make sure I am not buying in at the top. I promise you, if you read social media and are scared of missing out- buying too quickly will lead you to buy too high. Stocks don't rocket as fast as they lead you to believe.
7. Every stock is not about "to rocket" or go to the moon that day. 
8. Read the actual contracts. If you see a stock you are interested in- and theres lots of talk of its "going to rocket" due to a contract. Read and understand the contract. Contracts don't always mean immediate rise in stock. Sometimes the contract is contigent on certain things occuring. If I am interested in a stock with a known contract, and its not something immediate-- I write it in my stock bible to follow, that way I can follow the path the company is taking- and then put my money into it when its solid. I have found by waiting, the stock price is relatively the same if not lower, and I then use my money to invest in other things until that point occurs. 
9. Learn a little piece at a time. I see the stock market as an easy way to get overwhelmed and I acknowledge how little I know. So I learn a little bit at a time.  
10. Understand that no one truly can predict exactly when, or how much because the market has a lot of unpredictable factors... and honestly-- People with the most indepth knowledge of best choices are not going to tell you. I do not ask questions in forums regarding expectations-- I know its my job as an investor to do the legwork, and not for someone to hand me their hard work. It's my hard work. 

These are just a few of the lessons I have learned and thought I would share- I have many more of course. And I know I will have many more lessons and look forward to enjoying the ride.

One thing that has been bugging me from holding on long term however is the possibility of competition from more established tech companies. 

I’ve always heard that Palantir doesn’t have competition because they will work on projects deemed unethical by other companies ie when they took over Project Maven (a military contract) from Google because Google employees thought it was unethical, but that only applies to military contracts. The largest market for growth for Palantir is the commercial market but nothing is stopping from Google and others from competing there no?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Short Tesla? I like it!

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning December 7th, 2020.

# **Any progress on stimulus could give the market a boost in the week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/04/stimulus-hope-markets-focus-next-week.html)**
*****
> Stimulus to help the economy and vaccines to stop the virus are expected to the be the main focus in markets in the week ahead.
*****
> Efforts to move along a fiscal package in Congress picked up momentum in the past week with Congressional leaders sounding conciliatory, and a bi-partisan group of senators pushing their own $900 billion proposal.
*****
> “It probably boils down to how much [Senate Majority Leader] Mitch McConnell is willing to deal, and I don’t know what the answer is to that,” said Mike Schumacher, head of rate strategy at Wells Fargo. “If it’s going to happen, next week is the week. The government runs out of money on Friday. Congress has to come up with a funding scheme.”
*****
> Strategists have said the two events could be tied, but Congress could also push through a spending resolution without including stimulus. Some programs will expire at the end of the month, if Congress does not provide funding, including unemployment benefits for millions of Americans.
*****
> The on again, off again stimulus talks have led to skepticism in the market, and sets it up for a move higher if there is anything officially announced. “I wouldn’t think it’s fully baked in. I would say the stimulus is a positive catalyst, unless it’s less than $900 billion,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities.
*****
> While stocks surged in the past week, bond yields also moved higher. Yields move opposite price, and bond yields have been rising on stimulus expectations. More spending means more debt, and that sends rates higher.
*****
> The 10-year was at 0.97% Friday, and appeared ready to move back to the 1% level for the first time since March.
*****
> “Is it the case here, stimulus is already factored in, and will people take their money and run?” said Schumacher.
*****
> The S&P 500 gained 1.7% in the past week, ending Friday at 3,699, a record high. The Dow also ended up 1% at a record 30,218, and Nasdaq gained 2.1% to a record 12,464.
*****
> # Getting jabbed
> Vaccine news has been a catalyst for the market’s surge since early November, when Pfizer first revealed the high efficacy of its vaccine. Since then Moderna and Astra-Zeneca both revealed results of their own vaccines.
*****
> A Food and Drug Administration advisory committee meets Thursday on emergency use authorization for the Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine.
*****
> “They’re starting to roll it out in the U.K, and that’s something that’s going to be watched here to see how it unfolds,” said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist Prudential Financial. “That’s the next issue for the market. The deliveries, the distributions. Are people being jabbed? These are all questions the market is concerned about about because they’re looking forward to it unrolling smoothly in the U.S.”
*****
> About 3 million people will be vaccinated in the initial rollout. Moderna’s vaccine is expected to be approved the following week, and by year-end both vaccines are expected to reach 20 million people in the U.S.
*****
> “The vaccine news has started to see a bit of diminishing return in terms of its wow factor,” said Hogan. “There’s going to be some volatility around the logistics.”
*****
> Krosby said the virus remains in the forefront for the market because of the continuing spread and its economic impact as activities are shut down. California Thursday announced new restrictions with stay at home advisories in some regions.
*****
> “The big question is how long does the Covid surge last?” Krosby said.
*****
> The virus shutdowns appear to be behind a slowdown in the labor market, and economists say it could slow activity into the first quarter. November job growth of 245,000 was about 200,000 less than expected. That makes Thursday’s weekly jobless claims more important for markets.
*****
> There is also CPI and PPI inflation data Thursday and Friday.
*****
> “There is this push pull in the market regarding inflationary pressures,” said Krosby. “It’s not expected, which is why if it does print higher, it could ignite the conversation regarding inflation.”

> # Stocks and Bonds Both in Rally Mode

> When it comes to equity market performance in a given month, it doesn't get much better than November. While the S&P 500's total return of 10.95% in the month was only the second-best monthly performance of the year, it was still enough to rank as the third-best month for the S&P 500 in the last thirty years and just the ninth month since 1980 that it was up 10%+.

> The chart below shows the S&P 500's annualized total return over the last one, two, five, ten, and twenty years and compares the current returns to the historical average. For the last year, the S&P 500's total return has been 17.5% which is nearly six full percentage points higher than the historical average. For the last two years, the annualized return has been nearly as strong at 16.8%, and it is actually even stronger relative to the historical average of 10.5%. Moving further out the time horizon, the S&P 500's annualized returns drift lower, and while the five and ten-year annualized returns are greater than average, the S&P 500's annualized gain of 7.3% in the last 20 years is more than 3.5 percentage points below the historical average of 10.9%.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120120-SP-500-Act-vs-Avg.png))**

> The last couple of years haven't just been strong for equities. Over the last year, long-term US Treasuries, as measured by the Merrill Lynch 10+ Year US Treasury Index, have rallied 15.7%, which is more than six full percentage points greater than the historical average of 9.5%. Over the last two years, returns have been even stronger with an annualized gain of nearly 20%, or more than double the historical average of 9.1%! While the last two years have been strong for US Treasuries, the last five, ten, and twenty years have all seen returns of between one and two percentage points below their historical average.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120120LT-Treas-Act-vs-Avg.png))**

> Lately, when you see rallies in the equity market, it tends to be accompanied by a decline in treasuries as yields rise. In November, though, that wasn't the case. Even with the S&P 500 up 10.95%, long-term US Treasuries rallied just over 1%. So how uncommon is it for stocks to rally like they did in November while bonds also rally. Actually, it is not very uncommon at all. The table below shows the nine months since 1980 where the S&P 500's total return in a given month was 10% or more, and of those months, long-term treasuies also rallied in every month but one (October 2011).

> # Manufacturer Recovery Continues

> This morning, the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) released a less positive outlook for the US manufacturing sector. The headline number for ISM's Manufacturing index fell from 59.3 last month down to 57.5. A drop was expected, but the actual results were worse than the drop to 58.0 that had been forecasted. That reading indicates that the manufacturing sector continued to grow in November but at a slower rate than October.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120120-ISM-Headline.png))**

> Similar to the various Federal Reserve bank surveys from around the country, breadth in the November report was more negative than in recent months. Of the ten indices excluding the headline number, only three were higher in November: Backlog Orders, Supplier Deliveries, and Export Orders. Additionally, two indices—Customer Inventories and Employment—showed contractionary readings.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120120-ISM-Table1.png))**

> One theme of the report was that orders remain very healthy. New Orders fell from 67.9 to 65.1, but that is a sixth consecutive month of expansionary readings. Although the index was lower this month, meaning new order growth decelerated, it remains in the top decile of historical readings. As new orders have continued to grow, so too have backlogs. The index for Backlog Orders has continued to press higher, rising to 56.9 from 55.7. That is in the 88th percentile of all months and is now at the highest level since August of 2018. Demand continues to improve with new orders coming in at a historically strong pace, even though it is slower than last month, and order backlogs have once again risen as a result.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120120-ISM-Orders.png))**

> As new order growth decelerated, so too did production. The index fell from 63.0 in October to 60.8 last month. That is still consistent with growth (readings above 50) in production but at the slowest rate since June. One factor that potentially had an impact on the slowdown in production is issues with suppliers. The index for Supplier Deliveries rose for the fourth month in a row in November and reached the highest level since May. Higher readings in the Supplier Deliveries index indicates longer lead times and vice versa. In other words, products from suppliers have been taking longer to reach manufacturers, in turn, impacting productivity.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120120-ISM-Prod-Supp.png))**

> Although suppliers appear to have some constraints and production has slowed slightly, business inventories rose for the second month in a row even as more and more firms report that customer inventories are too low. The index for Customer Inventories now sits in the bottom 2% of historical readings after dropping another 0.4 points in November. At 36.3, the index is at the lowest level since June of 2010. That low reading can be considered positive for future production.

> * Best month for Dow since January 1987 (11.9%) and best November since 1928
> * Best month ever for the STOXX 600 (16.7%)
> * Best month ever for the Russell 2000 (18.3%)
> * Best month for the S&P 500 (10.8%) and Nasdaq (11.8%) since April 2020
> * Best month for Dow Transports since October 2011 (12.1%)
> * Best month from PHLX Semiconductor Index since March 2003 (18.4%)
> * Best month for Industrials (16.0%) and Financials (16.8%) since April 2009
> * Second best month ever for energy (28.0%)

> A way better than expected earnings season, a likely split Congress, and major breakthroughs on the vaccine front all helped stocks soar last month,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Add ongoing support from the Federal Reserve as the cherry on top and we are looking at a truly historic month on many levels.”

> Here’s all the Dow monthly returns since 1900. Last month was the best return since January 1987. Now before you go out and sell because you see 1987, remember the S&P 500 added another 20% the seven months after the huge gains in early 1987.

> It was the best November for the S&P 500 since November 1928.

> Small caps soared on the likelihood of taxes staying lower due to a divided Congress and vaccine progress, with the Russell 2000 adding more than 18% for the best month ever, topping the previous record from February 2000.

> What happens after a big month? Well, history says a 10% monthly gain is quite bullish. In fact, we had a 10% plus rally back in April 2020 and shared this same chart at that time. Sure enough, returns have been strong this time around as well. “The bottom line is the huge gains in November could actually be the start of something much stronger,” according to Ryan Detrick. “Also, this was the second month of 2020 with a 10% gain. The only other year to do that? 1982, which kicked off a historic bull market.”

> Turning to December, this month is widely known to be quite bullish, as Santa comes to town, people feel good, and stocks tend to do well. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, since 1950, December has been the second best month of the year, with only November better. December had been the best month of the year until the historic 9.2% drop in 2018. As a result, December hasn’t been quite as strong over the past 10 and 20 years.

> Breaking it down even more, a big rally in November can potentially steal some of December’s thunder. As after a 5% or 10% rally in November, the returns in December are more muted. The flipside to this though is if the S&P 500 is up more than 10% for the year (like 2020), then stocks have benefited from some performance chasing and have tended to do better.

> What does it all mean? After the historic move in November we wouldn’t be surprised to see below average returns in December. We do believe this is a new bull market and lasting economic cycle of growth, but overall sentiment is getting quite stretched and this increases the potential for some near-term weakness.

# DISCUSS!

What are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?

*****

I hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading week ahead r/stocks._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ You can only have 10 or less stocks in your portfolio. Which 10 companies are you choosing and why? (Limit a stock explanation to one sentence per company) DISCUSSION Hey r/stocks, thought this could create an interesting conversation.

Charlie Munger is credited with having said:

* "The whole secret of investment is to find places where it’s safe and wise to **non-diversify**. It’s just that simple. **Diversification** is *for the know-nothing investor*; it’s not for the professional."
* "The idea that very smart people with investment skills should have hugely **diversified** portfolios is madness. It’s a *very conventional madness*. And it’s taught in all the business schools. But they’re wrong."
* "Our investment style has been given a name - focus investing, which ***implies ten holdings***, not one hundred or four hundred."

If you were to concentrate, or rather, if you are concentrating your investments, what are you holding and why?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ A discussion about “time in the market vs timing the market” We’ve all seen it parroted on every investing related thread in the history of Reddit- “time in the market beats timing the market”. But I feel like this phrase gets misused quite a lot, and I would like to take this boring workday of a Saturday to just show the power of what “time in the market” actually has. 

1. What “time in the market” means and what it doesn’t mean 

Time in the market means, basically, maintaining ownership of assets that either 1, typically appreciate in value over time (stocks, real estate, commodities, etc) or 2, that produce a steady, ideally increasing, stream of income (dividend paying stocks, a business, rental properties, debt, etc). By “time in the market” it means that ownership of these assets over long periods of time, as in years and decades, is the key to wealth accumulation. If you look at most wealthy person alive today and in history, they gained their wealth through assets. They accumulate assets and own them. 

“Time in the market” does NOT mean buying clearly overvalued hype stocks because “I’m in for the long term”. I’m not gonna say any because I don’t want the comments to just be arguing about whether or not tesla is overvalued, but I hope you get the idea. However this doesn’t mean to just let your cash sit on the sidelines “waiting for a crash”. Typically there is no reason to have all your net worth tied up in cash, as it is the only asset class guaranteed to lose value over time. 

Rather, you should be in the middle: continuing to own assets you already own and being on the lookout for more, fairly valued ones. I promise you that you can find value out there if you look for it. Even then you don’t necessarily always have to be buying. Sometimes doing nothing is the best choice. 

2. You’re probably wasting your time (and money) 

If you’re anticipating a crash, good luck. There have been 8 major crashes since the 1920’s: an average of one every 12 years. There have been flash crashes and small recession but these shouldn’t concern you at all. On the large scale, the market has trended up for most of its existence. What makes this time different, exactly? Bulls have a tendency to believe that this time is different, but bears can have the same mindset, especially  considering that the US has been in a bull market for most of its history. So what makes this time different? 

Sure, we will enter a bear market eventually but the US market has never failed retest its highs. If you’re selling because you anticipate a “correction”, you’re just wasting your time and money. Corrections are a blip on the radar over time. They are normal, healthy and should be seen as a good thing, just the market breathing, per se; nobody actually thinks “stocks only go up and never go down”. 

Once you gain real money, in the high six figures and up, taxes will really start to eat into you. Selling positions with the intent to buy back in after a correction is probably an unprofitable endeavor. Why pay a good chunk of your earnings in taxes just to buy back 10% cheaper, especially when the 10% drop may or may not happen when you expect it to? This ties in to the last paragraph of point one, sometimes it’s best to do nothing and just continue to hold, letting your money work for you. 

3. Generational wealth

This is my main point. The Rothschilds, for example, have been building an empire for almost 300 years. That is 300 years of compounding interest. One thing they have done is accumulate assets, not sell them. The wealthy families of the Netherlands have been passing down assets for almost 400 years. 

Even on a less grandiose scale, just look to this subreddit. You’ll notice a lot of the users with higher portfolio balances probably received a nice inheritance somewhere along the way. This isn’t a bad thing and shouldn’t be shamed. After all, isn’t that everyone’s goal, to pass their wealth into their children? Unfortunately, with inheritances, a huge majority of inherited wealth is lost by the third generation. When the younger generation doesn’t know how to properly manage wealth, they end up wasting it all instead of further building it up. 

4. Compound interest 

Some call it the eighth wonder of the world, and rightfully so. There is no reason to interrupt compound interest unnecessarily. I would hope that most people here are investing with the goal of attaining compound interest, and selling your compounding assets is a solid way to halt it. 

5. Dividends 

Whether or not you chase dividends, I think we can all agree that we get some form of dividends or income from our investments. Dividends really show their power after several years of ownership. Buffett, for example, gets a 40% annual return from dividends on his initial Coca Cola investment. Fourty percent! And he doesn’t even DRIP them. Why on earth would people get rid of their assets that have potential to give those kind of returns after some years of ownership is beyond me. If you do a dividend return calculator going back multiple decades, you’ll find that most dividend paying securities will have similar returns once you have mature ownership of them. 

6. On “timing the market”

This is probably a controversial one but I definitely don’t believe in just buying whatever tickers you want because “time in the market beats timing the market”. Like I said above, time in > timing because of generational wealth, compound interest and ownership. It doesn’t mean buying the hottest Reddit ticker because you’re in for the long term. Taking well assessed risks with positive and realistic upside is ideal. 

Spending time to make sure the investment you’re about to make is a good investment is smart. If spending a week or two assessing your decision is a way to “miss out on sick gains bro, it’ll go up another 50% before you buy”, it’s probably a FOMO stock and you shouldn’t be in in the first place. If patience is key, that means patience with buying is just as important as patience with holding. 

At the end of the day I’m a believer in ownership. Looking through most of wealthy individuals of today and in history, they all had one thing in common: they maintained possession of assets. They don’t sell their portfolios because they’re scared of a crash, they don’t have their net worth in a savings account. They assume a little bit of managed risk and let their money work for them.

suppose someone has a $10,000 portfolio invested in fixed income, but through leverage, this person wants to have an equivalent position in stocks at the same time. Then, this investor would hold two SPY contracts monthly to have an equivalent exposure to the index. Would the return be similar to holding a SPY ETF?

Rules:

* Monthly options would be held until close to expiration (until 1 day prior to assignment day).
* Gains would be reinvested into fixed income, and the investor would re-purchase a number of contracts equivalent to 100% SPY position rounded down. So, if the portfolio would go to $40,000, this investor would instead hold 4 SPY long calls.

(Note that my long call examples reflect SPY's price as of today, so it's being calculated based on 1 share costing $369.85.)_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ NNOX...why is it not going up? people were wondering if they have a legit product, they have a good presentation, and nothing happens??? just like the title says....

I know I’m very new but this seems like a big deal._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ How to hedge your portfolio with currency futures options Portfolio hedging is usually done for very big portfolios from hedge  funds, institutionals and pension funds that want to cut risks in  investing at overseas equities such as Emerging Markets but it doesn’t  necessarily need to be so. Today we have multiple instruments that can  help an individual investor hedge his/hers portfolio no matter the size.  The main reason to hedge currencies is to avoid capital loss in your  base currency. As an example note that *since February 26th 2020 the* ***SP500*** *at the time of writing is 7.4% up while in EUR terms it’s down*. What this means is that as a European investor even if you made good choices you would still lose money because **USD** had a massive drop vs **EUR**  and that’s usually all you would care about, that’s the currency you  buy apartments, groceries etc. Same goes for an American investing in  Chinese equities or the Japanese **Nikkei**. Traditional theory says that over the long term currency **diversification**  would suffice but that means that you actually have a balanced basket  of world currencies in your portfolio and that’s hardly ever the case.  Usually an American would have 90% in USD and then 10% in emerging  markets or a European would have 60% of his portfolio in USD because of  the stagnant European stock markets during the last two decades and the  popularity of **FAANG** stocks. OK enough said, let’s see how someone can do this.

## Preparing

Of course we need a broker that gives us access to futures currency options markets. The biggest trading house is currently [Globex](https://www.cmegroup.com/globex.html). **Interactive Brokers**  work well and also have nice visualization tools to  see the graphs of  when the options become profitable and actual numbers so you can make  your own calculations. DeGiro also offers these services as well as the  biggest brokers in USA (TD Ameritrade etc).

## Different hedging tools

Ways to do it include futures and options on said futures, CFD options and shorting the currency pair. Let’s see all of them.

#### Futures

A [future](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/futures.asp)  is a contract that enables the buyer or seller to buy or sell at a  specified date and price the said asset (in this case either USD or  EUR). That is a bit problematic for small players because these  contracts trade at 125K minimums usually so if the expiry date comes you  need to have that kind of money available. That also means that in  order to hedge your portfolio you must have a big percentage of it  available in cash form which kind of defeats the purpose since most  investors want to actually have cash working for them either invested or  available for new opportunities.

#### Futures Options

Futures [Options](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/option.asp)  are traditional options that you can read more about on Investopedia  and we highly suggest doing that first because that’s a very complicated  financial instrument. With options the major advantage is that you  don’t need to have a big chunk of your capital that you want to protect  available because options work inherently with (big) leverage. This is  our preferred tool and you can see more about it on the example section.

#### Shorting Currency

Shorting the currency you hold most in your portfolio suffers from  the same problem as the futures. If you want to hedge 300K in USD you  need to have another 260K (approximation) available so you can hedge the  dollar. Some Forex brokers will allow you leverage on this trade but  the costs get out of hand fast and it’s not a long term solution. This  is a good speculation when you want to actually short a foreign currency  with a small part of your portfolio such as Brazilian, Turkish or other  currencies in danger at turbulent times, but that’s not hedging risk.

## General strategy

The best planning can be done with futures and shorts because you  know exactly the target prices and amounts. With options it’s more of a  hit and miss. First you need to chose how far out of the money your  strike price should be. Bibliography recommends *5% to 10%* **OTM** puts work best for hedging. Usual practice is to buy them **6 months out**  so you don’t speculate much on short-term geopolitical problems and  roll them over mid-to-end so that you don’t mess with all the Greeks and  get best value for money. Options trading specifics are very  complicated and our common thinking in Loft Financial is to not compete  with trading powerhouses because t*hey are sharks and they will eat you alive*. Very few people in the world can determine what’s a good price for a certain currency future option and *you are not one of them*.  Thus, it’s best to roll them over at some point mid-to-late when it’s  either at or OTM. The reason for this is that options lose their time  value when they are very deep ITM and thus you don’t gain much by  rolling them over sooner.

Another big question is how much should you hedge for and what does  this cover? You can play around and calculate when the options are ITM  and profitable (after you deduct the premium) how much of the portfolio  you can cover. A simple example would be:

Total portfolio value: 100K which is comprised of 70K USD and 30K EUR  
Base currency: EUR  
Current EUR/USD: 1.22  
Strike price: 1.25

An option for a currency future of the EUR/USD pair is trading  currently at $1700 for a 5% increase of the EUR  to 1.25 and becomes  profitable at 1.26 (because of the premium). Now we can pick a price  difference from now. Let’s pick 1.29 that’s 5.7% up. That means that  more or less our portfolio will take a hit for 3500. We can see with  some online tools (your broker should provide this) that this option  will yield a profit around 3000 at 1.29 so we could say that \*most\* of  our USD risk will be covered. As the option goes deeper and deeper the  hedge is bigger and starts to also be a profitable investment while  between 1.26-1.29 it’s a big on the lower side covering only partial  losses. If the option expires worthless that means that either USD was  steady and you lost some capital for the premium or it went up so you  gained overall. 

**Remember we are not trying to maximize profits but make the risk/reward profile better!**

How much of your exposure should you hedge? Following the theory that  you need to be diversified, if you hedge all your USD portfolio then  you would be totally exposed to EUR. We believe a better strategy is to  be diversified and leave some USD exposure as well as other currencies.  One could hedge for example only half of the USD exposure for best  diversification and least expenses on hedging.

## Costs

They are complicated and a function of the difference between  interest rates between the currency pairs. It’s also important what the  current situation is and if there is market turbulence, recessions etc.  There are quite a few ETFs that are hedged and we can see that they are  usually at the 2.5%-3.5% mark. They will always get a better price than  us due to volume and direct services from banks and clearing houses.  This is not a trivial cost and can eat up profits long term so it’s a  double edged sword. Currently options to hedge EUR/USD cost around 2%  for 6 months.

- The company has been running for 5 years now and got a new CFO last year. 

- their insurance includes motor and house with the former being their focus.

- you download their app and register. Keep your Location services on and after 3 weeks they give you a quotation for your motor insurance mainly using the data they gather through your phone. Quotation is for 6 month. 

Their main drawbacks are their customer service especially when they file for incident claims and not providing extra/additional motor insurance packages.

Another major con is the fact that ROOT app tracks your movements, which i believe many apps do too.

(Excuse my lousy writing, this is my first ever post about a stock)_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ How is Writing Options even profitable? So I've made the math, or at least, I thought I did.

Got over my Broker considering if Writing/Selling Calls and Puts might be a better deal than trading the available ones on the market.

Thing is; it seems somewhat much riskier and less profitable.

Obviously, pretend you're trading (Covered) Calls; this automatically implies you have to buy a pack of a hundred shares of the underlying stock, not only exposing you to its market downturn but also seems silly considering that when selling Calls, you expect the stock price to go or stay down, for fear of being exercised.

Having to buy hundreds of share of a stock you expect to stay down as a safety net seems counterproductive to me.

Also, when Writing contracts, Near ITM Weekly gives you good premium profit but drastically increases your chance of being exercised, Deep OTM on the other hand gives you very little Ask Price (what the point of writing 
0.50$-1$ premium contract is youre only making 100$ only).

I am really not sure how the average option trader have so much capitals they can cover multiples pack of 100 shares a week to cover their option, especially when using some advance tactics, spreads,etc. involving buying multiple different quotes of the same Options.

I'm an investor that trades purely based on fundamentals and I have not seen another company trading on NASDAQ with the growth and value figures that Turtle Beach offers. 

**The key takeaways** 

\- $303m market capitalisation. Q3 Revenue was $112.5m (140% YoY Growth) Q3 Income was $17.8m ($3.1m loss Q3 2019) 

\- They purchased a PC Peripherals company in June 2019, ROCCAT. Q2 2019 revenue was $1.3m, Q3 2020 Revenue was $9.6m (638% growth in 15 months)

\- Zero in revolving credit facilities, all outstanding debt cleared in Q3 2020 and $27.2m cash on hand

\- They have the highest market share in gaming headsets, and had #1 and #2 best-selling headsets in October 2020 during first month of new-gen console release.

&#x200B;

Based on their financials and impressive growth in earnings quarter on quarter, a market capitalisation of $303m seems extremely low. That puts the stock at 4.22 P/E MRQ and 0.67 P/S MRQ which is cheaper than most oil & gas explorer/ life insurance / real estate trust plays. It's a company that sells PC and Console gaming accessories at a time where new-gen consoles just got released, there's no justification for a market capitalisation this low and that's why I have invested.

>The 228-164 vote to approve the measure was bipartisan, and it was the first time either chamber of Congress had ever endorsed the legalization of cannabis.

What stocks do you recommend, if they are going to increase? Long term, short term?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ help on overnight buying power!  

I  forgot to ask my broker about overnight buying power...say for  example..I bought $400 worth of stocks on a margin account (on $100  equity, all my buying power is used up) on a friday and it is greater  than my overnight buying power, this is where the questions come up.

1. Does the overnight buying power take into consideration work days (i.e. no weekends) or does it include weekends as well.
2. Will my overnight buying power go into the negatives and Id have to go deposit money into the account? or worse....margin calls?

So I am wondering if i sell enough of the shares to get right below the overnight buying power. Will it just count Friday and not the weekends? 

P.S. I am located outside of the U.S._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Strategy Opinions So as furlough continues, I’ve definitely been keeping busy by short term selling stocks. Trying to catch runs and execute sales at reasonable targets. It got me thinking though if there was a better way to perhaps maximize my earnings while simultaneously considering the fluctuating growth rates.

Right now I mainly wait for a target in the 10-20% range. For some that’s probably pretty conservative, but with covid volatility and furlough I’m being more careful and setting more easily attainable targets. But, like always, my brain always tries to think if it can find a more profitable strategy as well. I want to get some insight on this approach, maybe compare it to other’s as well.

My stocks can often reach 15-20% in a span of 3-8 weeks, depending on what’s going on. However most reach 5% in the first 1-2 weeks. So it got me thinking, if it was good, I could set automatic sales that correspond to the number of weeks a stock is “growing”? Maybe a 5% target for week 1, 10% for week 2, 15% for the third and fourth week, and 20% for anything above 4 weeks...

Thoughts? Adjustments? Looking to discuss..._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Travel/Vaccine Supported Stocks that are not dependent on travel I got some Boeing stock right after the dip, and that has risen along with the airline industry. Even with that growth, less than half of Boeing's revenue comes from commercial airlines. In short, it gets the travel booth but also has other revenue streams, mainly government contracts.

Another example would be Disney, which should get a huge boost with their theme parks, cruises and hotels but has also been rapidly growing the streaming side of the business. 

I could see Square being another one. It seems like every food truck and many small businesses use their tech, and they are still rising based solely on their digital presence.

Starbucks and Chipotle could also fall in to this category because they have mastered online ordering. It seems like they are busier now than ever, but would still get a boost from a complete reopening.

Any thoughts or other examples?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Aren't airline stocks bound to go up eventually? I'm looking at Air Canada and they're sitting at around $27, whereas before COVID they were approx $50.

GM - 1,767,000

Ford - 1,496,000

Toyota - 1,779,302

Total = 5,035,302

Tesla - 228,290

Tesla would have to increase sales by a multiple of 22 to equal the top 3 manufacturers

Market CAP:

GM  - $63.55 B

Ford - $37.15 B

Toyota - $193.74 B

Total = $294.44 B

Tesla - $567.83 B

NIO - $58.62 B

&#x200B;

Tesla has a P/E Ratio of over 1,000. No idea what NIO's is but it's probably higher. GM, Ford and Toyota are all under 20. Basically, based on earnings Tesla is getting a 500X valuation compared to "traditional manufacturers". I understand that people argue that Tesla is not just a car company, but that doesn't explain the rise and crazy valuations of NIO, Xpeng and others.

The traditional companies are all working on EV, autonomous driving, etc. Hypothetically, couldn't one of these companies acquire an up and coming EV or someone who specializes in battery technology and exceed Tesla and NIO, etc. in EV sales. They already have the customer base, name recognition and distribution networks.

Are car manufacturers undervalued? I feel like they will have a much larger piece of the EV pie than these EV valuations would indicate_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Here’s how worried you should be about your stake in Alibaba, now that the U.S. is going after Chinese stocks Beijing might welcome the ban

Some say that Chinese authorities wouldn’t actually mind if this law goes through.

Let’s say Alibaba does get delisted. It actually speeds up something that Beijing is already trying to do: build up its own exchanges. 

More major Chinese companies listing at home would be welcome news, and it wouldn’t be so bad for these firms either.

Chinese markets are far more sophisticated today than they were 10 years ago, so companies retrenching and listing in China wouldn’t be as limiting as it once was.

And in terms of logistics, many of China’s blue-chip companies already have secondary listings in Hong Kong, which would make the transition far easier.

A company like Alibaba leaving the United States also appeals to Beijing, because it reduces the role of U.S. regulators.

“Having these companies trade in the United States gives rise to frictions with the Chinese authorities, because the U.S. authorities want to impose their rules on these companies,”

Why the U.S. has more to lose

If the law is passed, it could affect companies like Alibaba, oil giant PetroChina, JD.com and more than 200 other names.

Chinese companies listed on U.S. exchanges have a combined market capitalization of about $2.2 trillion, so a mass delisting would mean major movements of capital. Something that experts say could backfire on American investors.

“If the bill becomes law, I think these companies are going to leave our exchanges and they’re going to leave on prices that are not going to make American investors better off,” said Jesse Fried, a professor of law at the Harvard Law School, in an interview on CNBC’s “Street Signs Asia.”
