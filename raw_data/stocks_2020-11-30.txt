For a gaming company with growth prospects, this is super fucking undervalued with a P/E ratio of 7. Even Intel, a dying boomer company that only loses market share has a P/E ratio of 9.5. If you use P/E ratios to compare it to similar companies, it has a 4-5x upside.

It crushed last earnings 5x, but is still trading on a discount. There is little downside here and with holiday sales coming up (kids want headsets for Christmas for their new consoles), its gonna smash the next earnings again.

**Bright future:**

"The company's¬†drug cabozantinib is marketed under the name Cometriq. Cometriq was first approved in 2012 as a treatment for thyroid cancer. "

In 2015, the company co-developed another drug, cobimetinib. The FDA has approved it as a treatment for various forms of skin cancer.

In 2016, a tablet form of cabozantinib, marketed as Cabometyx, was approved for patients with renal cell carcinoma.

In 2019, the FDA approved Cabometyx for the most common type of liver cancer. Revenue has grown from a paltry $25 million in 2014 to almost $1 billion today.

In 2019, management announced that its first internally discovered compound since 2009 had begun a phase 1 clinical trial

Just this month, the FDA granted a priority review for the combination of Cabometyx with Bristol Myers Squibb's Opdivo as a treatment for patients with advanced kidney cancer.

In a clinical trial, participants taking the combination had a median survival duration of 16.6 months -- double the 8.3 month median of those using **Pfizer**'s ([NYSE:PFE](https://www.fool.com/quote/nyse/pfizer-inc/pfe/)) Sutent

Last week, Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (Takeda), EXEL's partner responsible for the clinical development and commercialization of cabozantinib in Japan, received approval from the Japanese Ministry of Health  to manufacture and market CABOMETYX as a treatment for patients with HCC that has progressed after prior systemic therapy.

\- HCC is  a liver cancer is a leading cause of cancer death worldwide, accounting for more than 700,000 deaths and 800,000 new cases each year.

In 4th quarter of 2020, EXEL will be elgible to receive a $15 million milestone payment from Takeda upon Takeda‚Äôs first commercial sale of CABOMETYX for unresectable HCC

**This company has launched more than 70 clinical trials and 9 of them are in phase 3.**

what is phase 3?

=> There are phase 0 to phase 4 in clinical trials, and phase 3 trials compare a new drug to the standard-of-care drug. These trials assess the side effects of each drug and which drug works better. Phase III trials enroll 100 or more patients. Phase3 clinical trials are often needed before the FDA will approve the use of a new drug for the general public

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Risk Factor:**

"But while its potential as a thyroid cancer treatment was limited, Cometriq's intended market, prostate cancer, was a $1.6 billion opportunity. "

In 2014, Cometriq only extended the lives of patients by an average of one month -- not a statistically significant result.

Commercial flights were supposed to start this year, but delayed into 2021 because of Covid and other factors.

If I was rich, I'd want to visit space at least once in my lifetime.  


To my knowledge, there is no other public company offering this kind of service any time soon (correct me if I'm wrong), since SpaceX is not public, and Blue Origin is not public.  


Obviously a long hold, but as soon as flights start taking off (and passengers doesn't come back dead), buying before the space-flight hype is probably a smart choice if you are interested in this type of stock.

Its shares rose 52% since Monday and touched a fresh intraday record at $33.50. The stock lost some of the gains on Friday after Citron Research said in a tweet it was shorting the stock with a $20 target. The company ended the session at $27.66.

Palantir representatives didn‚Äôt respond to a request for comment.

‚ÄúA lot of institutions have probably warmed up to the company and are viewing it as something to hold onto for the long term,‚Äù said Wayne Kaufman, chief market analyst at Phoenix Financial Services. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a great software company, and it has a terrific business, a very sticky business, not just with governments but also enterprises.‚Äù

Trading in Palantir options also surged this week with average daily volume of call contracts jumping about 250% in the first three days of the week when compared to the prior week. An analysis of open interest shows most of the contracts being opened and closed in the same day, indicating a heavy presence of day traders.

After an initial lackluster performance following its direct-listing stock debut, gains for the Denver-based firm, which sells data-analysis tools, have accelerated after hedge funds, including Steve Cohen‚Äôs Point72 Asset Management, reported purchasing the company‚Äôs shares.

‚ÄúBig-data companies have become very important and historically have been excellent stocks. Also, Palantir is benefiting from the pandemic -- tracking cases and analyzing data is right in its wheelhouse,‚Äù Kaufman said.

Since starting up in 2003, co-founder and chairman Peter Thiel has helped bankroll the business throughout its long period as a closely held business. Now, the stock has gained nearly 300% since its direct listing. It reported third-quarter losses in its first financial results since going public as compensation costs surged. It did, however, boost its revenue growth forecast for the year to 44%, exceeding the amount analysts expected on average.

‚ÄúI‚Äôd say the days of it trading below $20 are probably over,‚Äù Kaufman added.

[https://sec.report/Document/0001628280-20-016873/](https://sec.report/Document/0001628280-20-016873/)

The issuing of the 12.5mil shares will not inject any capital into the company. As I quote, Zoominfo **"will not receive any proceeds from the sale of the shares by the selling stockholders.**" This **only creates dilution**. Please note that the existing outstanding shares are merely 69 million shares.

***Edit***\*: for people wondering how can a company issue shares for free, this is share dilution. The seller is Carlyle in this case. Please read the S-1 file, I cannot quote every sentence here. But in summary, ZI does not receive the proceeds for the share sale.\*

&#x200B;

**This share dilution, together with the coming lockup release, will create a huge downward impact on the share price of $ZI.**

&#x200B;

I have never heard of this company until Friday when fellow reddist shared about its lockup expiry: [https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/k23kly/you\_all\_are\_obsessed\_with\_pltr\_lockup\_but\_do\_you/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/k23kly/you_all_are_obsessed_with_pltr_lockup_but_do_you/). I joined the trade because the logic is very consistent, rationale very clear.

"**If only 0.5% of locked shares are sold, this creates a selling pressure larger than 1 day's trading volume**" As I quote the author.

And now even more shares are issued for free, there is little chance (well nothing is impossible but just highly unlikely) its shares will go up in coming days.

Then there are trolls under the original post, arguing how lockups do not matter for stocks and may even drive them up, with **cherry-picked** examples trying to confuse other fellow readers. If you cherry-pick your example, you can make any crazy ideas sound reasonable. **How about I cherry-pick a random date in March where stocks tanked 10%, and then argue stocks go down 10% every day forever. Does that make sense?** That is just insane.

&#x200B;

I hereby summarize the logic of the original post. If you find it reasonable, it is not too late to sell. If you don't find it reasonable, then do the opposite.

&#x200B;

1. **Share lockup release, generally, more often than not, statistically, drives stock price down**. Because there will be selling pressure from original shareholders. If you argue with this, then I don't know how I can help you.
2. If a stock's price has tanked significantly after IPO, people may wait until it recovers to take profit. If a stock's price has risen significantly, more people will take profits. Make sense? **$ZI has risen a whopping 140% since IPO.** Selling pressure is almost guaranteed.
3. If a stock's lockup releases a huge number of shares, this will create a larger selling pressure. If a stock's lockup releases only a few shares, then probably not much of an impact. **$ZI's lockup releases 320 million shares, 4.6 times its current outstanding.**

&#x200B;

**Does this really not make sense?**

&#x200B;

His earlier threat of banning SMIC in late Summer had sent the then-soaring tech stocks into disarray and put a top on tech indexes on September 1 and sent the NASDAQ into a sinking pattern for months afterward. However, the markets have enjoyed a broad rally since the first week of November, which began in industrials, small caps and value stocks, but finally brought the tech sector to new highs last week for the first time since September.

The ban on SMIC is particularly disruptive of the US tech sector, and not just Chinese tech, because the US semiconductor industry is the dominant world supplier of semiconductor production equipment and design software and China is its largest customer. In turn, SMIC is in the supply chain for many US electronics products. The US semiconductor industry has been rallying since the election, in part, based on rising prospects of Biden‚Äôs win marking the end of the spread of the trade war into the semiconductor sector. 

Trump‚Äôs return to trade disruptions in the final weeks of his presidency, particularly in the tech sector, may mark the end of this current rally.

Additions factors that can combine with a disruption of trade to bring an end to this rally are OPEC+ discord ahead of a meeting to determine near-term changes in oil production levels for the remainder of the pandemic, the Treasury department clawing back some $500B of emergency bailout funds from the federal reserve in what many view as a premature declaration that no more aid is needed, the negative and uncommunicative tone of the restart of stimulus talks with the still-GOP-dominated senate and some due profit-taking and consolidation from the strong November rally that has brought indexes to new highs. 

November has seen one of the strongest post-election rallies in US history. November‚Äôs post-election relief rally was unquestionably partly due to relief from businesses that have been suffering declines, like the semiconductor industry, due to Trump pushing forward with a trade war while the country has been experiencing a pandemic recession.

EDIT: The small cap semiconductor stocks that I'm following are crashing into the open.

* Growth GAGR 45% since 2013 and 50% in 2020
* Gross margin 70%
* EBIT 60%
* FCF 45%
* RoIC 160%
* RoC 170%
* RoE +60%
* Net debt -38%

Customer base is huge. Some to mention $DKNG, $PENN and $DMYT. Almost every major player in the online casino world is their customer. They have been mainly in the Europe now, but have now made their way to North America and are going to Asia as well. They have now got intererest in the US markets from Bank of America and Morgan Stanley starting to covere them. Bank of America's target price is 980 SEK (now trading at 700 SEK).

They have had some competition in the field like Playtech, but they have crushed them and are the frontrunning company in this field. They have been very innovative and I have great trust that they will produce more games in the future that are even more popular.

There has been a talk that they are getting into the OMXS30 index in the next induction in 12th of December. OMXS30 is like the SP500 in Sweden. Also there has been rumors about NYSE listing, but that just the rumor in this point.

With renewed COVID restrictions amid the busiest shopping season of the year the implications for Stamps.com are exceptionally positive. Observe the following.

$STMP has benefitted greatly from COVID. With the increase in online shopping, small and large businesses alike have sought out the online marketplace to make up for the lack of on site traffic. As a result these companies need a method of convenient and economical shipping to move their goods to the consumer. This is where $STMP shines. Stamps.com enables businesses to purchase and print postage from USPS & UPS to be picked up on site by the shipping service. In short it turns any business into an Amazon warehouse.  

On 05 November 2020 STMP beat their revenue estimates by $32.15 million (+42% Year Over Year), and beat GAAP EPS by $2.48 ($0.82 expected). $STMP raised guidance and now expects full-year revenue of $705M to $735M vs. $710M consensus and EPS of $10.35 to $11.35 vs. $7.91 consensus. The new revenue guidance is well ahead of the $650M to $725M outlook issued in August.

This Black Friday [e-commerce sales ](https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2020/11/28/black-friday-traffic-in-stores-craters-52percent-during-pandemic.html) surged 21.6% over the year before according to Adobe analytics. In short, shoppers are using online retail, not in-store retail, which means more goods are being shipped to the consumer than ever before. 

Cyber Monday, the busiest online shopping day of the year, [is expected to beat more records](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/shopping/2020/11/28/cyber-monday-2020-black-friday-sales-records-coronavirus/6449464002/). Meaning more shipping to online shoppers. They‚Äôve even coined a name for the shipping disaster: ‚Äú[shipageddon](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/shopping/2020/11/28/cyber-monday-2020-black-friday-sales-records-coronavirus/6449464002/)‚Äù

Additionally [Shopify Announced Record Global Black Friday Sales of $2.4 Billion](https://investors.shopify.com/news-and-events/press-releases/news-details/2020/Shopify-Announces-Record-Global-Black-Friday-Sales-of-2.4-Billion/). This has [MASSIVE implications ](https://www.stamps.com/shipping/ecommerce-integrations/shopify/) for Stamps.com. Stamps.com‚Äôs website notes that ‚ÄúUsing the Stamps.com integration, Shopify customers can automatically import orders and batch print shipping labels for all USPS mail classes, both domestic and international. Stamps.com‚Äôs BestRate shopping engine will also help identify the most cost-effective mail class option using box size, delivery time guarantee and shipping zone. Once the USPS label is printed, the order status details such as the USPS tracking number, shipping date and mail class are automatically posted to your Shopify account. Shopify customers also get access to additional Stamps.com features such as hidden postage, discounts on USPS postage rates and insurance and return shipping labels. Learn more about the [https://www.stamps.com/shipping/ecommerce-integrations/shopify/](https://stamps.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/2936/)

Finally Amazon is so fearful of the shipping backlog that they‚Äôre [requesting their customers pick up their orders](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/national/article247392055.html) from ‚Äúcommunity hubs.‚Äù More indications of massive shipping. And STMP is [partnered](https://www.stamps.com/company-info/partners/)  with Amazon! 

So why not invest in over pumped companies like Amazon, Shopify, or any of the other massive online retailers that will no doubt benefit from record online sales? Well this is the good part! After Q3 earnings institutions and market makers decided to cool the stock off and take profit, as has happened the last three quarters. Meaning that Shopify is currently trading at a discount and will likely swing hard up until Q4 earnings. In short, retail investors, institutions, market makers, and their mothers, will likely be tripping over each other at some point to get a piece of this action. It‚Äôs why I entered early with 50 shares @ $177.00 . I personally expect STMP to be well over $200 by Q4 earnings. 

There are two possible drawbacks. 1) For you options gurus out there, STMP contracts are very expensive. Huge swings are priced in. The money here will likely be in selling options, not purchasing them. Perhaps covered calls or cash secured puts. Perhaps spreads. Perhaps a number of other options strategies may strike your fancy. 2) When COVID is behind us, STMP will likely make more $$ than pre-COVID, but not as much $$ as mid-COVID. This said STMP will still likely continue to grow in revenue and expand into foreign markets. For example, their wholly owned subsidiary, ShipStation, [is partnered with the Chinese Amazon, Alibaba (BABA)](https://www.shipstation.com/press/shipstation-alibaba-com-launch-integration-for-b2b-e-commerce-merchants/). The post-COVID outlook for STMP May have already been priced in by indication of their dramatic drop in share price after Q3 earnings. Whatever the case the COVID environment has likely forever changed how we shop and STMP will be there to profit from this phenomena. 

TL;DR

Stamps.com (STMP) is likely to have the largest quarter in their history as a result of COVID restrictions and record online sales amid the holiday shopping season. Now is the perfect time to buy the STMP dip while it‚Äôs sitting over $175 support. Relative to other beneficiaries of record online sales, STMP is trading at a relative discount.

Tesla, now sells its Model 3 electric cars in China and has been building new car manufacturing capacity in Shanghai to make its Model Y SUVs. It applied for the Shanghai-made Model Y SUV sales permission earlier this month.

It started delivering vehicles made in its Shanghai factory last December and sold more than 13,000 vehicles in China in October.

I‚Äôm still unclear when trades happen. I don‚Äôt want to try a market order because I am not sure if the stock would sky rocket from all the hype, and I wouldn‚Äôt have enough cash in my account to pay for 300 shares at a higher price. However, I want to get as many shares as possible.

I'm looking to do a long term investment in an Australian stock that has listings on both the Nasdaq (PLL) and the ASX (PLL.AX). The Australian listing is at around 0.35AUD while the Nasdaq is 26USD. With a strong conversion rate in Australia I am able to invest about 10k and wanted advice on which exchange would be a better option. 

Obviously with the stock at 0.35 I can buy a significant amount which which is why Im leaning toward the Australian exchange. Is there anything i should be considering beyond the fees? Is there anything that limits the performance of smaller market exchanges rhat I should be factoring in?

Thoughts?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ WHEN WILL THE GME SQUEEZE HAPPEN!? Answers here It already is...

Now, I know people want a dramatic explosion and that MAY happen depending on a few things. 
1. Will Cohen get tenured?
2. If he doesn‚Äôt, will he initiate a hostile takeover?
3. If he doesn‚Äôt, will he give up and sell his position?

In instance 1, I don‚Äôt believe we will see a sharp radical short squeeze but instead a big jump followed by a series of 10% days or so as we climb significantly. The shorts won‚Äôt need to bail immediately because they can wait and see if Cohen fails to bring GME to the digital era, thus bailing over time adding to the rise instead of a dramatic shift.

In instance 2, I believe this would trigger a huge short squeeze as it would leave so much uncertainty that it would scare the shorts into bailing. Because Cohen could fire the board and bring on a new team of God knows who and the shorts don‚Äôt want to go into a blind fight against a brand new team.

In instance 3, we will see a sharp fall, but then a climb again, because believe it or not GameStop is not Blockbuster. They have plenty of cash, little debt, and there is no case for them to go bankrupt within the next 5 years. 

I expect a nice rise all the way up until 12/8 earnings call. This will give us A LOT more information. Perhaps in the Call instance 1 takes place. If Cohen or his letters aren‚Äôt even mentioned then assume instances 2 or 3 will come to fruition.

Either way I expect a dip post earnings followed by a climb up, but I recommend getting in now because a lot can happen and it could happen at any time. Perhaps Cohen just says eff it and begins a hostile takeover tomorrow. Who knows? Get in now and hold. 

TLDR: Buy it. Hold it. It‚Äôs gonna go up, it might have a dramatic short squeeze like we all hope for, but either way, a continuous green climb looks very likely._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Any opinion on GLW stock?

Almost a half dozen well-known tech startups, each already valued privately at over $1 billion, have recently filed for IPOs, including Airbnb, DoorDash, and Roblox.

They're hoping to take advantage of strong investor appetite for tech stocks, despite the pandemic, and to catch the coat tails of other tech companies that have recently made [successful debuts](https://fortune.com/2020/08/29/2020-ipos-palantir-tech-ipo-asana-snowflake-predictions/). Shares in cloud database company Snowflake are up 129% since its September IPO and those of data mining company Palantir are up 215% since its September listing.

Here are key details to consider in weighing whether to invest in the latest batch of would-be public tech companies. Financial data is from the first nine months of 2020 unless otherwise indicated.

## Affirm

Symbol: AFRM  
Fiscal 2020 revenue: $510 million (fiscal year ended June 30)  
Revenue growth: 93%  
Gross margin: n/a  
Net loss: $113 million

[Affirm‚Äôs S-1 filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1820953/000110465920126927/tm2026663-4_s1.htm)

Founded in 2012 by PayPal co-founder Max Levchin, Affirm aims to [bring credit and lending to customers of all kinds of online retailers](https://fortune.com/2020/02/05/credit-cards-levchin-affirm-ceo-daily/). Those hard-to-miss layaway offers for a pair of shoes from Cole Haan or that cute coffee table on West Elm‚Äôs website? Affirm works behind the scenes to process the loans and often covers the cost of the item (in some cases, partner banks fund the loans). So far, Affirm has signed up over 6,500 retailer and helped consumers pay for almost $11 billion worth of products over the past three years.

**Pros**: Affirm says its ‚Äúbuy now, pay later‚Äù system is superior to credit cards, with no hidden fees or high interest rates (most Affirm offers are zero interest rate). Like other hot consumer companies, Affirm also touts its net promoter score of 78, suggesting more than three-quarters of customers would recommend the company.¬† As e-commerce grows, there‚Äôs plenty of room for growth in the market‚Äîless than 1% of e-commerce transactions in North America relied on ‚Äúbuy now pay later‚Äù deals. And Affirm says its data analysis of consumers‚Äô ability to pay lets it avoid major losses.

**Cons**: The largest e-commerce sites, like [Amazon](https://fortune.com/company/amazon-com/) and [Walmart](https://fortune.com/company/walmart/), have no need for Affirm and could even launch their own lending services. So could big banks or other financial institutions that can borrow money more cheaply than Affirm can. And more than one-quarter of all of Affirm‚Äôs lending has so far come from customers of a single retail partner: Peloton.

## Airbnb

Symbol: ABNB  
First nine months of 2020 revenue: $2.52 billion  
Revenue growth: -32%  
Gross margin: 74%  
Net loss: $697 million

[Airbnb‚Äôs S-1 filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1559720/000119312520294801/d81668ds1.htm)

As the now-famous story goes, Airbnb co-founders Brian Chesky and Joe Gebbia decided to rent some airbeds in their San Francisco apartment after a big design conference caused local hotels to be fully booked. Their little web site, AirBedandBreakfast.com, eventually grew into the titan that has rented space to 825 million customers cumulatively across 220 countries.

**Pros**: The fast-growing startup took a huge hit when COVID-19 curbed travel, but has since [almost bounced back](https://fortune.com/2020/06/30/airbnbceo-brian-chesky-bookings-rentals-recovery-2020-ipo-coronavirus-pandemic/). Bookings were down 72% in April compared to the same month in 2019, but for June through September, the declined narrowed to 19% to 23%. The company also brags in its regulatory filing that pandemic-related spending cuts, including slashing headcount by 25%, make it more efficient going forward.

**Cons**: The pandemic showed that the travel industry is subject to sharp downturns that cut into Airbnb‚Äôs sales, and infections are on the rise again worldwide. The company has also battled restrictive rules in many cities and countries seeking to ban short-term rentals. Airbnb's filing disclosed it‚Äôs also in a battle with the Internal Revenue Service that could cost it $1.4 billion if it loses. And even after being in business for more than a decade, Airbnb is still on pace to lose around $1 billion this year.

## DoorDash

Symbol: DASH  
First nine months of 2020 revenue: $1.92 billion  
Revenue growth: 226%  
Gross margin: 53%  
Net loss: $149 million

[DoorDash S-1 filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1792789/000119312520292381/d752207ds1.htm)

After moving to the U.S. as a child, DoorDash co-founder and CEO Tony Xu worked as a dishwasher in a Chinese restaurant to help make ends meet. The point of DoorDash, he says, is to help strivers and small businesses thrive. Now in business for seven years, DoorDash ‚Äúdashers‚Äù deliver food and other items from almost 400,000 businesses to 18 million consumers per month as of September.

**Pros**: DoorDash is the leading provider of delivery with over twice the market share of runner up Uber Eats as of October 2020. The pandemic has [ignited much faster growth](https://fortune.com/2020/05/25/coronavirus-jobs-food-delivery-doordash/) in food delivery as people avoid going out to eat. Some smaller players have already sold out (DoorDash bought Square‚Äôs Caviar service for $410 million last year), but further consolidation could let DoorDash charge more for its services.

**Cons**: Once the pandemic passes, many DoorDash customers [may return to eating](https://fortune.com/2020/11/16/can-doordash-maintain-its-pandemic-boost/) in restaurants. Although California voters approved a measure to continue to classify gig workers like DoorDash‚Äôs dashers as independent contractors, other governments still are trying to classify gig workers as employees, which could wreck DoorDash‚Äôs business model.

## Roblox

Symbol: RBLX  
First nine months of 2020 revenue: $589 million  
Revenue growth: 68%  
Gross margin: 74%  
Net loss: $206 million

[Roblox S-1 filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1315098/000119312520298230/d87104ds1.htm)

Much more than a video game, Roblox has become a virtual environment for millions of people and companies [to create their own games](https://fortune.com/2019/07/16/roblox-100-million-monthly-active-users/). Co-founders David Baszucki and Erik Cassel went from making software simulations for physics labs to creating Roblox in 2004. Now some 31 million people play daily, including three-quarters of all U.S. kids age 9 to 12, the company says (Research firm Dubit put the figure at [half of kids 9 to 12 this summer)](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/16/technology/roblox-tweens-videogame-coronavirus.html).

**Pros**: Roblox has plenty of reasons for developers to stick around, including its large devoted customer base and the Lua scripting language that makes it easier to make new games. About two-thirds of current users are from the U.S. and Canada, so there is room for considerable overseas expansion.

**Cons**: The pandemic super-charged Roblox growth rate, but kids may decide to put their screens down and play more outside after the crisis ends. Many users play on devices running [Apple](https://fortune.com/company/apple/) or [Google](https://fortune.com/company/alphabet/) software, putting Roblox somewhat at the mercy of the twin tech titans‚Äô app policies. Other games have been banned and the app stores decide how much of each sale they are entitled to. A joint venture with Tencent to bring Roblox to China could be impacted by increasing trade tensions or new restrictions. And gaming and social media platforms come and go depending on the latest fads. Roblox could be the MySpace of gaming.

## Wish (ContextLogic)

Symbol: WISH  
First nine months of 2020 revenue: $1.75 billion  
Revenue growth: 32%  
Gross margin: 65%  
Net loss: $176 million

[Wish S-1 filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1822250/000119312520298630/d82777ds1.htm)

Overshadowed by better known rivals like Amazon, [Alibaba](https://fortune.com/company/alibaba-group-holding/), and [eBay](https://fortune.com/company/ebay/), Wish [focuses its e-commerce services](https://fortune.com/2020/11/20/online-marketplace-wish-files-for-ipo/) on the ‚Äúaffordable‚Äù segment of consumers. Founded in 2010, Wish now helps more then 500,000 online sellers hawk goods to 100 million monthly active shoppers. Parent company ContextLogic has its name on the IPO registration filing.

**Pros**: Shopping online isn‚Äôt just for the wealthy. Wish says it's targeting the 44% of U.S. consumers and 85% of Europeans who have household incomes of $75,000 or less, plus shoppers in developing countries. Wish‚Äôs platform is mobile first, and 90% of purchases happen via its mobile app. Although Wish doesn't make a profit, it generated free cash flow (or cash from operating activities minus purchases of property and equipment) of $23 million in the first nine months of 2020.

**Cons**: Wish faces off against many larger rivals, such as Amazon, Alibaba and eBay, plus Shopify and Walmart. To compete against the giants, Wish spends vast sums, over $1 billion so far in 2020, on marketing. With deep connections in China, U.S.-based Wish could be hurt by worsening trade tensions. And as with other startups dependent on mobile apps, Google and Apple could undermine Wish‚Äôs business with new rules or requirements.

This is the first recession I have experienced and probably will not be my last. I noticed that after the 08' financial crisis (and this year's market crash), gold prices went up because of feds buying assets, which lowers interest rates and drives up commodity prices. Inflation has remained low for the past decade and even after the 08' crisis, but the US money supply has increased the most this year than any other year, which gives threat of rising inflation. Higher inflation means your return in bank is not as high in real terms, so it will be more attractive to hold gold.

Companies from Alibaba to Huawei are striving to become relevant in the trillion-dollar auto industry, which itself is seeking an electric transition and intelligent upgrade as 5G comes of age.

State-owned automaker SAIC Motor, a major player in China, unveiled this week a new electric vehicle arm called Zhiji, in which Alibaba and a Shanghai government-backed entity are minority shareholders. The tie-up comes as Chinese EV startups like Xpeng and Nio and their predecessor Tesla see their stocks soaring in recent months.

Alibaba's ties with SAIC can be traced back to 2015 when they jointly announced a $160 million investment in internet-connected cars. The partners moved on to form a joint venture called Banma (or 'Zebra') and Alibaba has since developed a slew of auto solutions for the Banma platform to enable everything from voice-activated navigation to voice ordering coffee, which is, of course, linked to the Alipay e-wallet.

Alibaba is certainly not SAIC's exclusive supplier, as it's also worked closely with the likes of BMW and Audi as well over the years.

For SAIC's new EV brand, Alibaba will continue to be its "technology solution provider," an Alibaba spokesperson told TechCrunch.

The other tech giant making big moves in auto is Huawei. Just this week, the telecoms equipment and smartphone maker announced it would fold its smart car unit into its consumer business group, which previously focused on handsets. The expanded group will continue to be steered by Richard Yu, regarded as the man who helped grow Huawei from an underdog in the mobile industry to a leading global player.

Huawei's ambition in auto is "not to manufacture cars but to focus on developing ICT [information and communications technology] to assist automakers in producing cars," the firm asserts in the statement, addressing rumors that it wants to encroach on traditional carmakers' turf.

Huawei's phone business has taken a hit since U.S. sanctions hobbled its supply chain. It sold its budget phone brand Honor recently in the hope that the spinoff, independent from Huawei, will be free from trade curbs.

I don‚Äôt see too many but there are always a few people talking shit on Reddit that are embracing a bear market or talking shit to people who are bullish. What would entice someone to being bearish in a market that is basically proven bullish. Is it because they have puts?  Is it because they want good stocks to drop so they can get them at a discount?  It seems like that would be a tough game to play in this market because lately the pullbacks that would allow you to buy in cheaper don‚Äôt last forever, AND obviously you‚Äôd want them to rebound quick to short or secure profit.  Is it just like how every family has one kid that likes the other sports teams than everyone else just to be different?  Are they just being trolls? I am very confused by this. I‚Äôve asked this here before and didn‚Äôt really get any responses. Maybe it‚Äôs a retarded question. 

I can tell you I always will want a bull market. Why wouldn‚Äôt you? If someone has any negatives to constantly being in a bull market that would also help solidify a concrete understanding of my original question._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Thoughts on BioNTech? I recently bought calls (all expiring at the end of the year) for Pfizer and Moderna - I sold Moderna way too early, making around 10% of what I could have. I'm debating buying a BioNTech call, it's recent growth looks very similar to Moderna's growth before it shot up. Is this sound reasoning or am I just reaching?

I‚Äôm curious if I would lose anything other than the initial premium deposit I paid (~110). If it doesn‚Äôt hit 30+ do I have to pay anything?

What situation would I be liable to pay a large amount of money if my call didn‚Äôt hit? 

Thank you!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Monday Morning Moves I intend on making all of these moves premarket.

Update: 
GME 1000 shares  @ 17.00
SRAC 10x 17.50C 1/15  
VGAC 500 shares  
PIC 50x 17.50C 12/18  
SNDL 10,000 shares @ 0.46

GME is for the purpose of riding the short squeeze, SRAC is for the potential Momentus merger however legal still has me concerned, VGAC is because I love Richard Branson and I hope this is the Hyperloop IPO but I can't seem to find evidence of that, PIC is for the X Fleet merger that already took place (a bit late to this one), SNDL is a bit risky because they have an announcement on 12/2 and hopefully that announcement is due to a merger or acquisition._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ There are hundreds of weed stocks, what's the best ticker(s) to go with? I'm kind of overwhelmed researching weed stocks as there seems to be infinite options. Most of them are pretty bad but I see a couple that look decent.

What are some reasons you would choose these longer settlement periods ?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ I draw with crayons so you don't have to. Last week I closed up $2,250 or 2.8%. Here's what's on the watchlist this week: CRM, TDOC, PTON, FSLY, PRPL, GME, RKT, GPS I'm back r/stocks with my plays this week. Last week I closed out half my positions and left a few on the table waiting for them to hit my targets. Since I still have some of my positions open from last week I made my watchlist longer for this week to keep an eye out on plays that become within my level. I've also had a lot of DMs asking for plays that can be used on a smaller account so I've included some tickers that require less capital to sell cash-secured-puts. These are simply positions I might be entering based on my own due diligence and analysis.

&#x200B;

**What am I doing?**

I do technical analysis and selling cash-secured-puts 1 to 4 weeks out on stocks that are nearing key levels of support. My goal is to collect premium, but should I get assigned I have absolutely zero problem running the wheel on stocks I want to own. As a backstory I nearly blew up my account doing WSB-style plays in March but have regained all of my account and then some running this strategy since April. What I do now is basically wheeling on weekly puts.

I watch over 200 stocks, I would say its 90% waiting game and 10% true technical analysis. My levels work, but it's normally because I am patiently waiting for an entry point. Yes that's a lot of tickers to watch, but I research my stocks on weekends and then monitor additional plays & levels during the weekday to see if there is an obvious setup I want to participate in.

# Here's a few things regarding my strategy

**1.** I don't over-leverage with spreads because if the stock price blows past your long strike and you assume max loss you need a lot of capital to actually be assigned the shares. For that reason I don't really see selling multiple spreads as a "Theta Gang" play and is still very high risk. If I do open a spread it will be a protective put for $1-5 just to protect myself should the company randomly announce bankruptcy.

**2.** I only sell cash-secured puts with the capability to be assigned if need be. My goal is to never take a loss on a position and always wheel it back to profitability. If something has changed fundamentally with the stock then yes I will close the position and realize the loss.

**3.** If IV on a ticker is very low, then yes I will outright buy shares instead.

**4.** I only aim for 1-4% per week collecting on theta and an occasional earnings theta yolo. No call-buying, no spreads, only put-selling and shares!

Honestly, that's about it. I'll go through some tickers on my watchlist this weekend and what I currently have open.

# Open Positions From Last Week

**FB:** 1x 18 Dec, 2020 $260 put sold to open. Up 50% on this option I sold, looking to sell early this week if we get a good pop and close it out at 60-70%.

**MSFT:** Holding 100 shares. Up 1.75% on the position. Stock sitting at $215, my short-term price target is around $218-220 before I look into selling the position.

**NVDA:** 30 shares. Up 0.24% on the position. Looking for $550 here.

**PTON:** 1x 11 Dec 2020 $101 put sold to open. Up 25% here will look to close at around 50-70% profit range.

# Chart Rules

**Pink Lines** = Trading range & channel. I find stocks typically trade within certain channels until an event, such as earnings or some news which changes the fundamentals of the stock price changes the trend and a new channel is formed.

**Blue Lines** = Key areas of support/resistance. I don't like focusing on supp/res levels every $2 down like some people do. I look at the bigger picture and find where where key levels of buyers come in to grab the stock. I'll try to sell puts there.

# Master Plays This Week (Stock price in parenthesis)

**CRM Salesforce ($248) - Earnings theta yolo**

[CRM CHART](https://imgur.com/uTjMgNF)

CRM has been the powerhouse is customer relations management throughout covid. High quality product that is converting more and more businesses into clients. Earnings are coming up this week so premiums will be juicy. The stock has been consolidating in a volatile range for about 2 months now. Uptrend still intact and close to the $240 support level where we will find some buyers. I'll be looking to enter a position here.

**Positions I'm watching:**

**1.** 1x Dec 11 2020, $240 strike put, sold to open for $7.60 or $760 premium. Return: 3% in 2 weeks. \*I'm selling the 0.33 delta put here. You can go to a lower strike and lower delta, maybe even $235 here and still get decent return.

**2.** Shares with PT to $280.

**TDOC Teladoc ($196)**

[TDOC CHART](https://imgur.com/NC6WSKs)

I entered TDOC a couple weeks ago and made a quick 2-3% return on my play in just 2 or 3 days after the stock price shot up. It's trading a little higher than when I entered my position last time, but still near the bottom of the trend channel (pink lines). I think anything close to $190 is a good entry point. I'll be keeping an on it and look to sell a 0.30 delta put option 4 weeks out if the timing is right.

**Positions I'm watching:**

**1.** 1x Dec 24 2020, $185 strike put, sold to open for $7.00 or $700 premium. Return: 3.7% in 4 weeks.

**2.** Shares with PT to $210-$215

**PTON Peloton ($109)**

[PTON CHART](https://imgur.com/Rl0L7pJ)

I already have a position in PTON open. I sold a put when it was down 6% in a single day last week. I think anywhere sub-$100 level there will be buying pressure to keep it up. When it broke out to $140 it quickly reversed back to the mean stock price and into the channel. Weird how that works ;) Looking at the chart would you buy the stock when it the stock price was going vertically up from $100 to $140? I try to avoid buying on vertical lines unless it's a vertical line down on a stock ticker I like. The trend is still up here even though it has wild swings. Eventually this ticker will lose it's juicy premiums when volatility goes down. I'll try to capture some theta in the mean time.

**Positions I'm watching:**

**1.** 1x Dec 24 2020, $101 strike put, sold to open for $4.45 or $445 premium. Return: 4.4% in 4 weeks.

**2.** Shares with PT back to $120.

**FSLY Fastly ($85)**

[FSLY CHART](https://imgur.com/x0QFpVj)

FSLY also trading in a range approaching that $85 resistance level. It might take off, but if it doesn't I will look to sell a put option around the $78 strike where I think we can find some buyers for the stock. This is another ticker that has volatile swings, but also has been trading steady in a range. Looking at charts like this helps me see where the stock is going and what it is doing. If you look at the daily or intraday you lose sight of these things because it has such wide swings. This will lead you to easily being spooked out of your positions or selling too soon.

**Positions I'm watching:**

**1.** 1x Dec 24 2020, $78 strike put, sold to open for $3.75 or $375 premium. Return: 4.8% in 4 weeks.

**2.** Shares with PT up to $95.

**PRPL Purple Mattress ($30)**

[PRPL CHART](https://imgur.com/ccdQhGV)

PRPL is outside the trend lines and outperforming and also right at the resistance line. Sounds cliche, but the stock will either continue up and outside the range, where I will not touch it, or come back down to the $26-28 range where I will look to sell some puts. IV is still high on this ticker and makes premiums good to sell on. Will need to see where the stock goes this week before any decisions are made.

**Positions I'm watching:**

Waiting for a dip and for the stock price to come back into the channel. Waiting.

**GME Gamestop ($16)**

[GME CHART](https://imgur.com/LjpQ9Ie)

The possibilities where this stock can go are infinite. Premiums sky high. Strong support at $11 and we have some at the $14 range. If we get another up day of 10% tomorrow I won't touch this stock, otherwise I might sell some puts 4-6 weeks out and try to capitalize on the crazy IV this ticker has. This is a higher risk, higher reward play that I am willing to take. Why? Short interest is sky high. When the stock price increases, shorts will cover their losses which will squeeze the stock higher. If the stock price goes down, we will see some dip buyers and also potentially some shorts closing positions for break-even.

**Positions I'm watching:**

**1.** I will look to sell puts at an appropriate strike when the time comes. If the stock is up 10% Monday I won't chase it.

# Long-term holds I am watching

PLTR (Palantir) and AAPL (Apple Inc). Unfortunately AAPL has terrible premiums so I can't collect any theta on it, but I do like the pricing point going into the holidays. Some of the main tech stocks have been under-performing for some time. I think there is a good opportunity to get some before they begin to take-off again.

I did some research on Palantir stock this weekend and I gotta say I like it. The stock has almost tripled in just a few weeks, but I will be looking to enter some long-term positions in shares if or when the stock dips._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ How does everyone feel about ARK funds?
