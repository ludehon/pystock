 Did anyone watch Dirty Gold (part of Dirty Money) on Netflix? FBI agents find out that the US Mint, which is part of the US Treasury, is buying gold from drug lords and cartels. 

The way it works is: these drug lords sell tons of drugs in the US, earn a ton of cash which they cannot deposit at any bank, so they bring back to Latin America through various ways, then use the cash to buy large amounts of raw gold from sketchy companies there, then they create their own shadow companies, and sell their gold to various US gold companies, INCLUDING the US Mint. The FBI agents found out that 80% of gold providers that the US Mint buy from are linked to the cartels and drug lords.

California's electric grid is literally a dumpster fire. And now, we're asking the system to take on more burden by phasing out sale of internal-combustion vehicles by 2030.

* Plug (hydrogen plants)

[https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-stock-market-bubble-its-more-like-a-fire-11605888002?mod=hp\_lead\_pos12](https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-stock-market-bubble-its-more-like-a-fire-11605888002?mod=hp_lead_pos12)

 

The stock market isn’t a bubble, but parts of it are on fire.

So far in 2020, the NYSE FANG+ index of giant technology stocks is up 78%. The [Renaissance IPO ETF](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/IPO), [IPO **1.45%** ](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/IPO?mod=chiclets)an exchange-traded fund that holds recent public offerings, is up 84%. The [SPDR S&P Kensho Clean Power ETF](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/CNRG), [CNRG **+1.35%** ](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/CNRG?mod=chiclets)which invests in renewable-energy companies, has gained 88%.

Meanwhile, the overall stock market is up almost 11%.

That’s a key difference.

For years, anyone who thinks any financial asset is somewhat overvalued has called it a bubble. The financial use of “bubble” [originated centuries ago ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/BL-TOTALB-501?mod=article_inline)to describe massive speculation that [inflates market prices to the bursting point](https://www.wsj.com/articles/when-does-a-bubble-spell-trouble-1389399975?mod=article_inline).

Financial bubbles have never had a formal definition, though, and they are [diabolically difficult to identify](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204621904577017960729384948?mod=article_inline) without the benefit of hindsight. A new book, “Boom and Bust: A Global History of Financial Bubbles,” by finance scholars William Quinn and John Turner of Queen’s University Belfast in Northern Ireland, helps clarify the muddled thinking on the topic.

The image of a bubble is itself a misnomer. As any kid who’s ever chewed gum knows, bubbles often barely expand before bursting, and they don’t bother anybody much except parents and teachers.

Financial markets, however, can easily heat up fivefold or even 10-fold and then collapse at least 50% in a flash, burning millions of speculators and sometimes charring entire economies. Think of the U.S. after [the stock market crash of 1929](https://www.wsj.com/articles/putting-the-buy-and-hold-gospel-to-the-ultimate-test-11572015606?mod=article_inline), or [Japan 60-plus years later](https://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2015/04/23/excited-about-the-nasdaq-record-dont-overpay-for-tech-again/).

Rather than regarding overvalued assets as a bubble, we might consider them a fire. The more it expands and the hotter it gets, the more havoc it can wreak.

“Boom and Bust” looks closely at 300 years’ worth of market manias using the metaphor of “[the fire triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_triangle).” That image has long been evoked to explain the conditions necessary for flames to erupt and persist: oxygen, fuel and heat. Remove one, and you can prevent or put out a fire.

The oxygen of investing is marketability, or the ease of buying and selling an asset. Centuries ago, that meant carving up difficult-to-transfer corporate ownership into tradable shares. Nowadays it’s carrying a stockbroker in your pocket. With a smartphone-trading app, you can buy or sell so-called fractional shares in increments anyone can afford.

On popular trading apps like Robinhood, you can put as little as $1 in [Berkshire Hathaway](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/BRK.B) Inc.’s Class A shares, which cost about $345,000 apiece. You can trade that morsel of approximately 0.000003 shares commission-free.

The second side of the fire triangle, fuel, is manifested in financial markets by money and credit. Low interest rates make investing with borrowed money cheaper, while paltry yields on safe savings compel people to invest in riskier alternatives.

Today, borrowed money fuels mega-billion-dollar private-equity firms buying entire companies—and individual investors conducting small “margin” trades with as little as $2,000 in a brokerage account.

The third side of the triangle, heat, is supplied by speculation. When prices go up, more people buy, inflaming prices even more and attracting another rush of speculators.

That lures in naive buyers who think making money is easy. But [hedge funds and other institutions](https://www.fmg.ac.uk/pwc/publications/discussion-papers/institutional-theory-momentum-and-reversal-0) also chase those hot returns, fanning the flames even higher.

The “Boom and Bust” book completes the metaphor by noting that the fire triangle has in recent years been [updated with a fourth component](https://www.nfpa.org/News-and-Research/Publications-and-media/Press-Room/Reporters-Guide-to-Fire-and-NFPA/All-about-fire#tri), an “exothermic chain reaction.”

Marketability, credit and speculation are necessary, but not sufficient, to start and maintain a market fire. A fourth component, what the authors call a “spark,” is also needed.

That can come from new technology, government intervention or both. The stock-buying binge of the late 1990s was sparked by euphoria over the potential of the internet. China’s more-recent market booms have been stoked by government policies and propaganda.

“Boom and Bust” shows that most bubbles tend to be confined to a few stocks or industries.

That was true in 1824-25, when Latin American mining stocks listed in London rose more than fivefold in roughly six months, while British blue-chip companies lost almost a tenth of their market value. Again in London, in the 1890s, shares in bicycle companies more than doubled in a year even as major stocks went nowhere.

In 1999, with internet stocks going ga-ga, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index gained 86%. Without [technology companies](http://www.ajopartners.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/99_12.pdf), the S&P 500 would have been up only 5%.

Today isn’t much different.

In proportion to market size—which weights giant tech stocks heavily—the companies in the S&P 500 recently traded at 21 times expected earnings over the next 12 months, according to Matarin Capital Management, an investment firm in New York. That’s about 24% higher than their average over the past quarter-century.

To counteract the effect of a handful of giant stocks, however, we can weight companies equally. In that light, the S&P 500 is at about 17 times expected earnings, roughly 10% above its long-term average. That implies that most stocks aren’t cheap—but are hardly overstretched.

I don’t see much cause for concern about overheating in relatively small areas like newly listed stocks, alternative-energy firms and [shell companies formed to do buyouts](https://www.wsj.com/articles/investors-flock-to-spacs-where-risks-lurk-and-track-records-are-poor-11605263402?mod=article_inline).

The bigger worry is that a fire among a few giant stocks can set the neighborhood ablaze. After the technology-heavy Nasdaq index collapsed in 2000, the broader S&P 500 also tumbled.

Recently, smaller companies and cheap “value” stocks have started to show signs of recovery—which, if it persists, could reduce the market weight of blazing-hot giants like [Amazon.com](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/AMZN) Inc.

I could do a out of the money strike price for 19 and get a premium of $0.5 (random number) 
OR
I could do a strike price for 25 and get a premium of $6.5

Everywhere I read they say the 19$ one is a better choice since it’s below the share price, but in the end to break even they’re both $18.50.

Why wouldn’t I write the 25 strike price and collect the nice premium, because they still have to wait for the price to be below 18.50 to exercise the option and drop below breaking even. If they exercise it then I’m still paying $18.50 a share as I would for the 19$ put option but if they don’t exercise the option then I get a much better premium.

Key points:

- In the next couple of decades, due to the falling production costs, fossil fuels will continue to lead as the primary energy source, even with the increased investments in, and generation of, renewables. Oil will continue to remain the dominant source for energy for transport while in the heating sector, natural gas will take the lead role. Faster transition resulting in an earlier end of fossil fuel dependence is possible with strong and consistent sustainable development policies and efficient disbursement of investments; but there may not be major renewable projects that can be brought online in the immediate future. Therefore, at the global level, cheaper fossil fuels may continue to support demand and discourage clean energy solutions for some time.

- Major oil and gas companies are observing development of green hydrogen with keen interest. This is also a part of Europe’s green deal package with numerous investment support policies, pilot projects and a dozen roadmaps for using hydrogen for energy.

- Any major government support is likely to be for projects that accelerate the energy transition to a zero carbon emission economy or transition from the fossil fuels industry. The stimulus plans, government support and the post pandemic recovery of China (which leads the solar panels and wind energy sectors) will determine the pace of recovery. Despite government interventions, full recovery may not be possible given that many of the energy related infrastructure projects and related economic activities are shelved or indefinitely postponed._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Views on this rotation news we are seeing in the markets?

Bitcoin has recently attracted substantial investments from a couple of companies like MicroStrategy (420 million USD) and Square (50 million), as well as a few large individual investors like Tim Draper (500 million), Paul Tudor Jones, and Ricardo Salinas (unnown amounts).  Some companies like Greyscale, PayPal, and Fidelity, while not investing in Bitcoin itself, have created services and derivative products that hope to extract substantial revenue from Bitcoin investors.  

These large players have justified their choice with the claim that Bitcoin is a good hedge investment because its market price is uncorrelated with the real economy or with the price of other traditional hedges, such as gold, real estate, or T-bonds; and its value is somehow likely to increase, even while those assets lose their because of the pandemic.  

This claim has some rational justification, since Bitcoin's does not have any significant interaction with the real economy or a "fundamental" value derived from expected dividends. Its market price is therefore not affected by business closures, unemployment, or a possible hyper-devaluation of the dollar.

Yet Bitcoin was not designed to be an investment instrument, much less a hedge against general economic crisis.  Its future is threatened by several structural flaws, such as its huge energy consumption (6 gigawatts, like that of the entire Detroit metropolitan area) and its association with criminal activities.  

Thus I call the attention of the readers of this subreddit to [SuCoAsMa](https://www.ic.unicamp.br/~stolfi/bitcoin/sucoasma/prospectus.pdf), a new alternative hedge asset that was designed from the ground up to for that very purpose.  It adopts the key features of Bitcoin's business model, that fully insulates it from the vagaries of the real economy, while eliminating its fatal flaws.   

It is possible that some old school financial experts who actually bother to read its Prospectus may not be favorably impressed.  However, as explained in that document, this new asset  has even better revenue potential for brokers and marketplace operators, if properly exploited.

The majority of many vegetable varieties in U.S. grocery stores are shipped from Mexico where they are sprayed with chemical pesticides three to four times a week. They are genetically modified for transportation and don’t have the nutrient density of those organically grown. AppHarvest believes its Appalachian location between the East Coast and the Midwest could be a solution and bring jobs back.

Meanwhile, Covid-19, in addition to pointing out myriad flaws across the healthcare industry, has also exposed vulnerability in supply chains. AppHarvest is betting that supply chain disruptions related to the coronavirus pandemic will push large grocers to back more domestic sources of produce.

Then there is climate change. AppHarvest’s third facility, located in Berea, Ky., will be 15 acres and grow leafy greens. Drought-stricken Arizona and California currently produce 90% of U.S.-grown leafy greens. Central Appalachia has so much rain that the facilities can be operated on 100% recycled rainwater."

I’m mulling over implementing tax harvesting as part of my strategy. I’ve always been a buy and hold person but now looking at various etfs seems easy to realize a loss and still stay invested in the same general sector. 

My question for those who do any sort of tax loss harvesting is, do you usually realize losses and gains within a year or two? I liked the idea as a way to save up losses to be applied against a big capital gains bill many years later but this doesn’t seem to make sense as maybe you’ll have losses a little while (1-2 yrs?) after purchasing an etf but after a certain point, you’ll never be below your cost base and therefore no losses to realize until you sell some for gains and repurchase.

So am I correct that in order to fully utilize the strategy you would have to realize capital gains every few years?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ IBM (NYSE: IBM) - An In-depth Stock Analysis # Introduction:

Good evening everyone. This post will be an in-depth look at IBM, and is likely going to end up being a bit lengthy. The stock is in a bit of a weird position, there is no doubt there will be people on both sides of the fence when looking at this stock. First we will take a look at the business for those unfamiliar, then the financials, and lastly their potential road ahead.

There will be a few questions we are looking to answer:

1. Is there revenue growth?
2. Is there earnings growth?
3. Is the company really leveraged? (Low/High debt)
4. Is there strong cash flow?

# IBM - International Business Machines:

International Business Machines' mdel is to be a part of everything IT's enterprise needs. The company primarily sells:

* Infrastructure services (37% of revenue),
* Software (29% of revenue),
* IT services (23% of revenue),
* Hardware (8% of revenues).

IBM operates in 175 countries and has over 80,000 business partners to service 5,200 clients – which includes 95% of all Fortune 500. IBM’s outward impact is substantial. For example, IBM manages 90% of all credit card transactions globally and is responsible for 50% of all wireless connections in the world.

**Strengths:**

>\- The company has been able to use its large free cash flow to invest heavily in the future (R&D and acquisitions) as well as buy back significant amounts of its own stock. Additionally the cash flow is allow the company to transition its larger customer base from old lower margin businesses to new higher margin, higher growth products and services.  
>  
>\- The company consistently tops the annual list of U.S. patent beneficiaries.  
>  
>\- The acquisition of Red Hat is transforming the company toward new Cloud technology.

**Risks:**

>\- IBM’s old mainframe business is in a long term decline. As we will see in the next section, over the last 10 years the company’s Revenue growth is negative, Cash Flow from Operations (CFO) is barely positive.  
>  
>\- While the stock share buybacks were listed as a positive, they are also a negative.  IBM's Earnings Per Share (EPS) is only positive because they bought back so many shares.  
>  
>\- And most importantly, data and analytics businesses face fierce competition from corporations such as Amazon,  Microsoft, and others.

# Financial History:

There is going to be a lot to unpack here, let's look at the general trend here.

|Year|Revenue|EBITDA|Debt|Debt / Earning|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2011|106,916|26,361|27,163|1.0|
|2013|98,368|27,478|29,680|1.4|
|2015|81,741|20,372|38,702|1.9|
|2016|79,919|18,551|40,902|2.2|
|2017|79,139|16,223|45,086|2.8|
|2018|79,591|16,711|42,656|2.6|
|2019|77,147|16,844|66,883|4.0|

The revenue has decreased approx 4% each year over the last decade, earnings has also decreased down to $16 Billion while their debt has ballooned to over $66.8 Billion setting the current debt/earnings ratio to 4x...big ouch.

Looking back at the first chart there are two things that need to be pointed out. Firstly, the decline in revenue and EBITDA has been leveling out, from 2017-2019 we can see there hasn't been as much of a decline. Secondly, the ballooning in debt in 2019 is attributed to IMB acquiring Red Hat.

So let's answer some of the questions.

1. Is there revenue growth?  - No
2. Is there earnings growth? - No
3. Is the company really leveraged? (Low/High debt) - Lots of Debt
4. Is there strong cash flow? Hmmm.

This is where things are going to get interesting. and less gloomy. (But it is still gloomy)

&#x200B;

|Year|Cash Flow from Operations|Capital Expenditures|FCF/E Ratio|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2011|19,846|4,108|16,787|
|2015|17,225|3,579|13,594|
|2019|14,770|2,286|31,365|

What is really interesting, and a little weird here is they are generating \~$15 Billion in cash flow, and only putting \~$2.3 Billion back into the company, leaving around $12 Billion of free cash flow. When we look at their Free Cash to Equity we can see this has sharply rose, despite declining revenue and earnings.

At the current stock levels the free cash flow yield over the last decade has been \~11%. So if they can continue to stop their decline, or even turn around at this point there could be strong profit potential.

Let's quickly look into where the money is coming from.

**Revenue:**

|Revenue Sector|2018|2019|Year-Year Change|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Cloud & Cognitive Software|22,209|23,200|\+6%|
|Global Business Services|16,595|16,634|\+2.4%|
|Global Tech Services|29,146|27,361|\-3.7%|

Looking at only the top 3 of their revenue sectors, we can see their Cloud & Business services growing at a \~2.65% weighted, and their Tech dropping by 3.7% from 2018 to 2019. This is potentially promising and their new CFO and CEO are investing heavily into this Cloud services. From their prospectus they are projecting potential 60% growth revenue models.

This also does not take into account the potential from their Red Hat acquisition.

# So what's the big if?

The big "IF" is whether or not they can turn the business around from where it is currently at or if it will just continue to decline. The earnings/revenue/debt numbers look terrifying right now, but strong cash flow is what allows companies to survive into the future. If IBM can increase their revenue and earnings, pay down debt, and maintain or increase their current cash flow there is a potential for a strong return.

# Some other numbers:

NOTE: Current for November 2020 and very likely to change.

|Current Annual Payout / Share|$6.52|
|:-|:-|
|Yield|5.84%|
|10 Yr Div Growth Rate|11.6|
|3 Yr Div Growth Rate|5.3|
|1 Yr Div Growth Rate|3.5|
|Current EPS Payout Ratio|72.77%|
|Years on Consecutive Div Increase|25 Years|

As it stands right now, the company is remaining committed to the dividend payouts. They currently have the cash flow to support it, however the payout ratio is already 72%. To maintain this their revenue will need to increase in the coming years.

# Final Thoughts:

IBM has been beaten down and currently sits in an interesting position. It is a global behemoth of a company with a wide moat, it is very intertwined in many different services, yet, over the last decade, it has languished financially under their previously poor leadership.

Picking this up, maintaining your current position, or staying far away depends on your personal risk tolerance. They have been declining, but the decline has slowed. Their growth in the Cloud sector is becoming more profitable, but it has many competitors there. There was a change in upper leadership. They have high levels or debt, but high levels of cash flow. So much is going on. (They are also involved in crypto - Stellar Lumens for those interested in that, won't be talking about it in detail here)

Ultimately, you need to ask yourself, do you believe in this company?

I hope everyone found this post interesting, please supplement this with your own research. What is everyone's opinion about the company?

As always, thanks for reading, and have a good day/night!

Learning but by bit here, self taught investor and still struggling with concepts of options.  

Say I buy 1 call contract at $1 (total $100).... if I want to limit my losses to $10, I thought I would want to sell when the option hits $0.90. In Robinhood (where my play money is), I go and enter an order to sell that option at $0.90, but every time, even if the option is at $0.96, it sells for $0.90.  I hope this makes sense, but essentially I’m trying to figure out how to prevent too much loss on a call.
