A deal between the UK and the EU is in everyone's commercial interests, so let's hope they get there!

Weakness in the dollar index has been a feature of 2020 to date. Should the dollar index close below 90, it opens the way for considerable further weakness.
The question is: are US economic and monetary fundamentals that much worse than for its major trading partners? After all, the EU is hardly a picture of economic health and interest rates in Europe are even lower than in the US.

At present, investors such as myself appear more concerned about the scale of the upcoming fiscal stimulus in the US compared to elsewhere. The US has always had a growth bias and in the past has had no calms about letting its currency take the adjustment.

Gold: 

A weak dollar offers a decent tailwind for the gold price given that gold is priced in dollars. The chart is an update and highlights where the gold price is compared to its underlying trend, which I assume is represented by its 30-week moving average.
In this latest correction in gold's uptrend, the gold price has dipped below its 30-week moving average. That was a normal feature of the 2001 to 2011 gold bull market and each time it recovered and went on to make fresh highs.

I am working on the assumption that the same
pattern will play itself out this time around. So, what is it that gives us confidence that the gold price remains in an uptrend?
-Firstly, the dollar index remains in a fairly pronounced downtrend, although one would expect support around current levels.
-Secondly, US long-term interest rates remain below the rate of US consumer price inflation (CPI), and with US CPI likely to pick up in 2021 the gap can only widen. Negative real interest rates (i.e. interest rates below inflation) have always provided a tailwind for gold.
-Thirdly, a gold price declining below its 30-week moving average is not a 'Sell' signal. Under the technical indicator we track for gold, a 'Sell' signal requires the 30-week moving average price to decline below the 50-week moving average price. Given that both the 30-week and 50-week moving averages remain in uptrends, we are not near any such 'Sell' signal.

The only negative for the gold price is that it remains well above its intrinsic value (which we estimate to be in the region of $1,250 an ounce). On balance, we continue to believe that the weight of arguments support the bullish case for gold. Investment demand for gold is likely to stay strong in an environment where the Federal Reserve (the US central Bank) continues to print money to finance massive US fiscal and trade deficits and in the knowledge that US interest rates cannot be increased for fear of causing more economic damage.

**Background**

iRobot is a US-based consumer robot company. It designs and builds robots that assist consumers with the solutions for the activities to be carried both inside and outside of the home.

It derives the nearly all of it's revenue from it's in house cleaning robots. iRobot price range for it's robots are between $250 to $1000+. The cheapest robots give a simplistic cleaning such as just bouncing around the room multiple times to clean whereas the most expensive robots have AI to detect and smart map your room/house and efficiently clean.

The big selling points of this top tier robot range is the auto emptying bin functionality that has made these robots almost completely autonomous without much human interaction needed. This high tier product range is where iRobot really shines compared to it's competitors.

**Competitors**

iRobot's biggest risk in my opinion is it's competitors.

There are already quite a few such as Shark, Ecovacs, Roborock, Neato, iLife, and eufy. As autonomous vacuum cleaners become more popular (and they will) we can expect more competitors to enter this space as well potentially causing margins to be pushed down.  Dyson, Bissell, Hoover, Samsung, LG and Panasonic are the traditional heavyweights and are also entering this space. Dyson especially has a history of innovation and could be a future threat.

While iRobot has lost 12% market share since 2016 the overall market is significantly bigger, especially for the upper end product mix.

This is great news for iRobot as their products have the most added value in the upper range of this mix with features such as:- Auto emptying into bins- Smart AI pathfinding- Efficient charging of it's robots- Deep clean capability

The upper end of it's products have great reviews online. This youtube video explains the differences between the competitors very well and rates iRobot the best in the cheapest and most expensive categories for 2020: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYjlDwY9wPo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYjlDwY9wPo)

**Numbers**Opearing margin: 11%No debt.PEG Ratio: 0.78.ROIC vs WACC 22% to 10.11%

iRobot has some really great numbers relative to it's peers. It's operating margins especially are indictive of a big MOAT and consumer loyalty.

**DCF**

I used Aswath Damoradan's spreadsheet for this. Here are the inputs:

**18% CAGR** was chosen for years 2-5. Considering the rapidly expanding autonomous vacuum market and now COVID-19 has accelerated this very rapidly due to more people spending time at home therefore they are spending more on household items.

The recent revenue growths of 40% in the last quarter are due to the full lockdowns people have had. I expect this to drop in the following years to 18% on average.

**10% EBIT Margin** was chosen for year 10. COVID-19 has had a big impact so far this quarter on margins due to the huge demand. This will level off though.

iRobot has a loyal product base and as they have shifted more towards the high end products I expect them to acheive margins of around 10% in year 10.

**3 years** was chosen for the margins to converge. This is because the short term spike from covid should level off.

**2.5 sales to cap ratio** was chosen. COVID-19 has stalled the companies plans to transition away from China to other parts of Asia, including Malaysia to 2021. This transitioning is happening due to the tarrifs between China & the U.S. This should cause a short term dip in sales to capital ratio in 2021 due to having to reinvest heavily to move it's operations out of China._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Oil Tanker Stock Oil demand in the West is generally forecast to return to ~80% pre-COVID levels towards the end of 2021 as long as the vaccine rollout is swift and effective.

Could one build a portfolio, which taking into account all the bankruptcies, companies getting bought out, parts of companies being spinned off and the spin-offs both failing and succeeding, could sustain itself essentially forever assuming dividends get reinvested back, but no new companies are bought once the portfolio has been built?

I am aware that there is a US mutual fund that has both survive AND outperformed S&P500 throughout it's existence even though it hasn't made ANY new purchases beyond reinvesting dividends back into the original companies and their spinoffs for over 50 years. But then again, being concentrated in a single country could land you in a 1917-Russia or a similar scenario where the stock market goes to 0 and there is no recovery ever for the old holders. And even that successful US fund (whose name unfortunately escapes me right now) is down to 17 names last I heard about it, from the original 25-30 companies.

While doing this I found out about $NET (thanks to this sub).

Emphasis mine._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Dividends Will Have Their Day Again **Dividends Will Have Their Day Again**

*Dividend-paying stocks haven’t been superstars lately and in theory they shouldn’t be, but companies that pay them could shine once more*

* https://www.wsj.com/articles/dividends-will-have-their-day-again-11607785380

What do you call an investment strategy that would have left the likes of Amazon, Facebook, Tesla, Netflix and Google parent Alphabet out of your portfolio?

Aside from some unprintable words, “stodgy” might come to mind. But until recently, a portfolio that mechanically excluded such nonpayers of dividends would have done very well. They might again in practice, even if they shouldn’t in theory.

Franco Modigliani and Merton Miller, pioneers of modern financial theory, argued decades ago that investors should in theory be largely indifferent to dividends. Since the 1980s, the payouts have become quaint in the U.S. as companies have been able to freely buy back their shares. In the second quarter of this year, the yield from buybacks in the S&P 500 was 2.52% whereas the dividend yield was just 1.75%, according to Yardeni Research.

The decision to pay out cash comes down to how much money investors think management can earn if they keep it. Activist investors have split on the issue recently with D.E. Shaw pushing Exxon Mobil XOM -0.48% to cut expenditures to maintain its fat dividend and Third Point asking Walt Disney DIS 13.59% to suspend its payout and invest in streaming instead.

Yet for something that theoretically shouldn’t matter, dividend-paying stocks have done swimmingly. The key seems to be focusing on those with high but sustainable payouts. Slicing large U.S. companies into quintiles by dividend yield found that the second-highest-yielding group beat the market most consistently each year over many decades. Measured from 1928 through 2019, a basket of dividend payers in that quintile saw a $1 investment turn into $25,395, according to Dartmouth College professor Kenneth French. A basket of nonpayers would have been worth just $2,139.

That result is all the more remarkable because dividends were a relatively small part of investors’ returns during the market’s most-rewarding decades. In the 1990s and 2010s they produced 16% and 17% of the S&P 500’s return, according to data from Morningstar and Hartford Funds. But they more than made up for it during less-exciting periods like the 1940s and 1970s, when they made up 67% and 73% of the return, respectively.

Part of the answer for why dividends mattered is that reinvesting them during those bleak times paid off—easier said than done when investors get discouraged. But another is what sort of company pays them in the first place. A dividend payer is more likely to be a value stock. In June, the average price-to-book ratio of Dividend Aristocrats such as AbbVie, ABBV -1.07% 3M MMM 0.31% and Colgate-Palmolive, CL 0.11% with at least a quarter century of rising payouts, was less than half that of the S&P Growth Index, according to ProShares. Value is out of fashion now, like it was in the 1990s and other bullish periods, but cheap stocks shine when the party ends. The same might not be true for companies that mostly reward shareholders through buybacks since they are much quicker to slash them just as stocks plunge.

Long-time dividend payers hate angering shareholders by cutting payouts. That might force them to borrow money to fund those coupons or to skip good investment opportunities, but it also leads managers to avoid bad investments. They are better stewards of investors’ capital because they have to spend it more judiciously.

Dividends may not be the most efficient way of producing good companies. Still, it is hard to argue with the results._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Delmonte TICKER FDP Well. I have good news for you guys.

I'm a rather new investor here, but could one not do an arbitrage deal with the merger?

The transaction between Salesforce and Slack is fairly straightforward. As part of the deal, Salesforce will pay to shareholders of Slack $26.79 per unit in cash. In addition to this, Slack’s investors will receive 0.0776 shares of common stock in Salesforce.

So therefore, the 1 Slack Stock = 26.79 + 0.0776 Salesforce stock.

Rn, 12/12/20

salesforce stock is: 222.42

Slack stock is: 42.24

Left hand side (Slack stock price) - Right hand side (how much salesforce will pay you)

42.24 != 26.79 + 0.0776\*222.42
