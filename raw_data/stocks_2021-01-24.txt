 Reasons Why I like Achieve Life Sciences Why Achieve Life Sciences NASDAQ(ACHV) is a good long-term investment: 

They are working on a proven drug that can help with the number one cause of preventable deaths in the world which is smoking. The drug which is currently in phase 3 trials, called Cytisinicline, has been used for many years in Eastern Europe, and if/once approved in the U.S. it will be a good alternative to the current gold standard drug in smoking cessation which is Pfizer's Chantix which is going off patent in the near future, but in 2019 had over [$1 billion in sales](https://s21.q4cdn.com/317678438/files/doc_financials/Quarterly/2019/q4/Q4-2019-PFE-Earnings-Release.pdf). Achieve's main drug candidate Cytisincline is a naturally derived drug and has already gone through a phase 3 trial, which was sponsored by the University of Auckland in New Zealand, where 679 smokers took part, with the final results showing those who took Cytisinicline were [1.55 times more likely](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02957786) to have quit smoking at 6 months compared to those who took Pfizer's Varenicline (Chantix). Even more impressive was that Cytisinicline had a significantly better side effect profile than Varenicline (Chantix), by having [50% fewer adverse events](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02957786) in the trial subjects. Clearly, there is a large demand for better addiction remedies in the market as quitting smoking takes on average [8-10 attempts](https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/fact_sheets/cessation/smoking-cessation-fast-facts/index.html), and current treatments such as nicotine patches and gums can be addicting as well, thus making it clear better treatments for smokers is much needed. 

Achieve Life Sciences also secured a [15-year manufacturing deal](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/achieve-announces-exclusive-long-term-manufacturing-agreement-with-sopharma-for-clinical-and-commercial-supply-of-cytisine-300543646.html) with Sopharm to exclusively manufacture the drug ensuring the company is preparing for an eventual commercial launch that in my view could peak at between $300-500 million in sales. This sales estimate bodes well for its current market capitalization of $70 million, and the company also currently has roughly [$30 million in cash](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/achieve-life-sciences-announces-pricing-of-15-million-public-offering-301185305.html) to fund its current phase 3 trial. And be it that Varenicline is a natural drug, it will only have [5 years](https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnlamattina/2015/05/18/entrepreneur-touts-cheap-safe-smoking-cessation-drug-but-is-it/?sh=9bd838f71b63) of patent exclusivity in the U.S., however in the 2nd biggest pharma market which is the EU it likely would receive 10 years of patent exclusivity.  

Now, with small pharma companies, there are inherent risks involved which is true with any industry as well, and this company has no revenue and is [funded entirely](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/achieve-life-sciences-announces-pricing-of-15-million-public-offering-301185305.html) by the capital markets, which is why I have a diversified portfolio, but for the reasons I have pointed out in this post, the future is bright for Achieve Life Sciences and it's main drug candidate is on a path to market that will result in many smokers quitting thus saving many lives first and foremost, and taking needless cost out of the healthcare system.

The TLDR of that post is: *The publicly traded entity (RKT) is essentially a minority owner & manager of the revenue generating organization that we know as Rocket Mortgage, Rocket Auto, Lendesk etc. The bulk of income & assets are attributable to RHI, AKA Dan Gilbert and family.*

Does anyone have other examples where a majority of net income is attributable to a non-controlling interest, not to the actual publicly traded share holders? I am looking to broaden my understanding of how markets react & how companies can potentially modify their structure to be more investor friendly over time.

My friend who recommended this stock to me holds more than 20k in shares for a long term position._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Understanding Blackberry: Part 2 (No knowledge of soccer required)   

In 2016 Mckinsey issued a report called Monetizing Car Data. The report estimates the potential revenues when the cars are connected online. They said that the overall revenue pool from car data monetization at a global scale might add up to USD 450 - 750 billion by 2030.

Here is a breakdown of the possible revenue streams as per the report: 

In-Car Sources of income (QNX Income):

&#x200B;

1. OEMs selling the service to customers and advertisers paying for the data are among the business models that might contribute to the value of the data-enabled social driving experience, which is expected to have an estimated value of USD 7 - 8 billion by 2030.

&#x200B;

1. High-tech giants are positioned to provide the fundamental car data analytics services that car OEMs and advertisers are willing to buy. In addition to being the IT backbone, they can offer front-end applications.

&#x200B;

1. Start-ups are the smaller counterparts of the high-tech      giants, entering the car data monetization space from a variety of angles,      such as developing new apps, engineering innovative hardware/interfaces      (e.g., retro-fittable gesture-activated controls)

&#x200B;

1. Retailers and service centers are using car data      analytics to optimize their sales network and get the messages about their      offerings directly to drivers

&#x200B;

1. Automotive OEMs. In addition to selling connectivity-related options and services (e.g., infotainment,      navigation), OEMs are already becoming active in-car data analytics to better understand how customers use their cars, shape their repair and maintenance choices, and improve the link between dealers and customers      (e.g., allowing for real-time, remote booking of vehicle check-ups).
2. Insurers are able to capitalize on car data by offering      usage-based insurance contracts, exploring occasion-related policies

Big data and Cloud Sources of Income (IVY Income):

&#x200B;

1. Service providers offer data management services 
2. Regulators/government institutions are setting the standards regarding the collection and sharing of car data.
3. Automotive suppliers are developing the software and      hardware that are forming the infrastructure capable of capturing,      analyzing, and selling car data
4. Roadside assistance providers can collect and process      distress calls in real-time from vehicle sensors and automated alerts
5. Infrastructure operators, including      billing/toll road operators and recharging/refueling players, are      analyzing car data to optimize the geographic deployment of their      respective services

Customer willingness to pay for features – as opposed to a preference for free, ad-supported features – varies across use cases and geographies. To make it easier for us to have an early estimate of QNX potential revenues, we need to know their market share geographically too.

Germany (As per 2020 Sales):

QNX Clients: VW + Mercedes + BMW + Audi + Ford + Toyota + Kia= more than 62% of the Auto Market 

China (As per 2019 Car sales):

QNX Clients: VW+ Honda + Hyundai + Mercedes + BMW +Kia= 42.7% 

USA: 

QNX Clients: More than 70% 

\*\*New EV Clients of QNX are not included and not projected in any figures 

\*\*GM and Porsche signed deals with Android Auto and Apple to be the operating systems of the car despite these cars running with QNX system. We can exclude them as QNX clients for now. 

**Back to customer willingness to pay per product/service:**

**1.Predictive maintenance services:**

Germany: 73% 

USA: 73%

China: 78%

QNX Market share: 45% of Germany Revenues +

53% of US revenues+32% of China revenues 

**2. Time-related use cases, such as networked parking:**

Germany: 71%

USA: 72%

China: 76%

Paying customers for networked parking in a QNX powered car: 43% of Germany + 51% of USA + 31.9% of China 

The majority prefer a One-time price at time of vehicle purchase of USD 300

&#x200B;

**3. Predictive maintenance, and vehicle usage monitoring and scoring:**

Germany: 72%

USA:71%

China: 78%

Paying customers for predictive maintenance, monitoring, and scoring in a QNX powered car: 43% of Germany + 51% of USA + 32% of China

Willingness to pay for connected navigation:

Germany: 45%

USA: 28%

China:35%

Paying customers for connected navigation in QNX power car: 28% of Germany + 20% of USA + 14.7% of China 

The majority prefer One-time payment to activate the service of USD 20

&#x200B;

**FOR IVY solutions and products:**

Willingness to share data:

Germany: 92%

US: 93%

China:98%

As the report said, car data monetization at a global scale might add up to USD 450 by 2030. If we take a look at Goldman Sachs report about expected car sales by 2025 

Emerging Markets: 78 Million cars

Developed Countries: 34 Million cars

If we assume that by 2025 every car powered by QNX would have the new QNX system ( They said the first one will launch in 2023) and if we apply the QNX market share above. 

**QNX would power:**

32 Million cars in emerging markets  

22 Million cars in developed markets

If QNX offered a bundle of $15/month (and $10 in emerging markets) tailored package for parking assistance and maintenance and other services in developed countries. and If we apply the willingness to pay numbers from the Mckinsey report

**QNX Potential Revenue from basic features package:**

Developed Countries: 22M \* 71% \* 15 \* 12 = $ 2.8Bn

Emerging Countries: 32M \* 78% \* 10\* 12= $ 2.9Bn 

If you add up an estimate for the rest of the products it might provide and potential contracts it can have for IVY with several governments, It would be easy for Balckberry to reach 8-10 Bn in Sales by 2025._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ ROTH IRA - Selling GME and repurchasing in Roth? Smart or waste of time? I wish I bought all my GME stonks in my Roth (about $20k) but it’s currently maxed out. Is it worth selling some big positions in Roth like GOOG/VGT/VTI? This would clear up pretty much as much ive invested in GME so then I could sell my other GME shares in non-Roth when it is at a stable is price and then repurchase all in my Roth. 

Would this be stupid? Due to the volatility, selling and rebuying within seconds or minutes could even amount to hundreds in loss or gains just due to the time it will take. 

 But the tax advantages of not paying taxes on earnings if I make tens of thousands or more could be far greater. 

Is there a suggested way to do this? Unfortunately I maxed out last year and this year contributions_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Best Brokerage Accounts Hello reddit, I'm looking into opening a brokerage account for a Roth IRA, but I'd also like to use the account for long term investments and/or experiment with day trading. Is Fidelity a good company for this? Please share any other brokerage accounts and experience overall._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Question buying options. So I’m new to the options trading but have found tons of people making absolute bank on buying options when they think the stock will go up, I understand you can also make money on puts if you believe the stock will go down. I have reviewed several YouTube videos to learn more but still have questions based on what I see. 

If I thought a stock at a current price of 50 is going up to 60 I would want to buy an option. 

I use Robinhood platform for my current trades. I know that once you click the date you think the strike price will exercise, there are numbers that come up with you’re premium to the right.

I know you have ITM, and ATM options and Out of money. 

For me I thought for example if a stock would go up at current rate of 50 to 55 I would want to find a contract around that level, and if it hits over 55 I’m making more on my contracts with premium going up and can sell ASAP or leave for the contact to expire, which you would not make as much money where there are decay factors. 

So what I don’t understand is why the premium is lower at say 54 than at 51? Is that because the higher you go you can expect not to many would believe this to go that high hence the lower premium? And where it is higher it’s more likely to hit that so higher premium? 

Also if I believe a stock is going up and it’s current price is 50 and I buy 55 call at a premium of 1.30 I know I would pay 1.30 x 100 or (  per contract ) so 130.00 total . Now depending on the factors of premium adjustments such as , decay, interest , price, volatility etc etc. the price within 2 days goes to 57 and now premium is at say 6.00 ( just random number ) I could than sell that contract ASAP to collect 6.00x 100 gaining 600.00 and - the 130.00 so 470.00 in profits? 

How does the sale function work on say Robin Hood is there an option on my Home Screen that allows me to sell and I could instantly sell that contract and it would give me the 470.00 that day or does it take 2-3 days how does that work? 

On the opposite side if my option is at 55 at current price of 50 and it goes down to 45, how would I get out to where I would just lose my premium without having to pay more? I know this is where dates matter and it may go up still so I would hold but if it expired at 46, I than would just sell it to lose my initial premium and walk away? I know there are very risky trades with sell options and stuff which I would never get into. In other words how do you get out and make you’re money?

Know I would never jump right into option trades based on info given and would start with paper trading until I was confident I had it down. 

Any info would be great ! Thanks!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Scrubbing PBW in search of the Clean Energy Bubble *(For your tl;dr takeaways, read the TOTAL FUND and FOOTNOTES sections.)*

There has been lots of chatter lately about a clean energy speculative bubble. I wanted to do this assessment for both PBW and ICLN, but it took way more time than I expected, so I stopped after PBW. This only looks at the market caps, revenues, and net incomes of PBW’s holdings.

PBW has 58 total positions. The two smallest (cash and a mutual fund) account for 0.05% of its total weight, and were omitted from this study. I only considered the other 56 holdings.

# TOTAL FUND

* Raw total market cap of the 56 holdings: $1.316 trillion. Raw avg market cap: $23.5 billion. Weighted average market cap: $25.324 billion.
* Combining all market caps and net income numbers: raw net margin: -1.07%. Weighted average net margin: -2.17%. As a whole, not only is this ETF *not profitable,* it is heavily weighted in some highly speculative companies.
* IMO this is an effective fund for exposure to the meme EV stocks and to the ridiculous ride of the speculative gains. But the adage that "ETFs reduce risk" is only relative, and PBW is centered on some very high risk holdings.

# UNCLEAN ENERGY

The numbers for clean energy are actually worse than this, because there are 11 companies ^(1) that are not at all clean energy focused and have no business in a clean energy fund imo. They mostly have an industrial focus that only tangentially touches on clean energy. Their price ratios are distinctly lower, they're less volatile, and as a group they're way more profitable.

* These 11 companies comprise 16.9% of the total weight of the fund. Despite only accounting for 9.4% of the total raw market cap of the companies in the fund, they generate 21.8% of the total revenue.
* Their combined net income is $3.7 billion, with a net margin of 10.2%. This is compared to the other 45 clean companies, with a combined net *loss* of $5.4 billion and a loss margin of 4.2%.

# THE BRIGHT SIDE

* There are 15 actual clean energy companies in PBW which are also profitable ^(2)
* These companies, however, only account for 27.7% of the fund’s total weight, despite their combined raw market caps accounting for a whopping 70% of the fund, and generating 50% of the total revenue. For reduced risk exposure to clean energy, stock in these companies is a good way to reduce some risk.
* These companies operate at a combined net margin of 5.24%.

# THE DARK SIDE

There are 30 clean energy companies in PBW which operate at a negative net margin. Despite comprising only 20% of the total market cap and generating only 27% of the revenue, these companies account for nearly 56% of the total weight of the fund. Their combined net margin loss is -21.45%.

# THE DANGEROUS

* Included in those 30 not-profitable companies are 11 with net margins that are either worse than 100% in the red ^(3), or they don’t even generate a dime of revenue yet ^(4)
* They are weighted at 19% of the total fund, but they account for less than 4% of total market cap and less than 0.2% of total revenue.
* Their combined net margin is 286% in the red.

FOOTNOTES

(1) The eleven PBW holdings that don’t qualify as green energy imo are IEA, SQM, WLDN, ALB, AEIS, PWR, MYRG, ESE, WWD, APD, BWEN. Of these, only ESE and BWEN have a negative net income.

(2) The profitable clean energy companies in PBW are DQ, SPWR, TPIC, ORA, TSLA, CSIQ, AMRC, RUN, FSLR, REGI, ENPH, OLED, JKS, THRM, SEDG. Valuations on these companies generally appear reasonable-ish.

(3) FUV, (-640%), Omitted Pennystock 1 (-111%), Omitted Pennystock 2 (-3,962%), NOVA (-128%), WKHS (-14,914%), BLNK (-432%), and AYRO (-690%) are the six which generate revenue but have a net margin worse than 100%.

(4) LAC, EOSE, RIDE, FSR, and QS all generate 0$ in revenue. They have an average market cap of nearly $6 billion (!!!), and they comprise 8.5% of the total weight of PBW.

*(Disclosure: I hold long positions in PBW (87 shares), AMRC (58), Omitted Pennystock 1 (72), MAXN (62), TPIC (27), LTHM (352), NIO (16), XPEV (16), LAC (38). I plan to continue holding many, including PBW, but I will be using this post as a guide to adjust my risk exposure.*_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Hedging Longer Term Calls with Short Term Puts? Hi Everyone,

\*\* THIS HAS nothing to do with AMC or GME just FYI!

I wanted to get some opinions on whether this makes sense.  I am going to try to paint a clear and detailed picture in hopes of getting some meaningful responses.

Let's say you are holding 100 call options Expiring April 17 which are deep in the money, up a few hundred percent and let's say earnings is let's say February 11.

So you are making $10,000 every time the stock goes up $1.00 

You want to hedge your longer term call options gains just for a small window going into earnings... nothing longer....

So you buy 100 cheap puts that expire let's say a week after earnings...

Buy owning the exact same amount of calls and puts... would your downside be capped at the time you took the position?  Because for every time the stock goes down $1.00 you are losing $10,000 off your calls but increasing your puts by $10,000?  Essentially this would be a zero sum trade to the downside... but your upside would be uncapped correct?  

I say upside would be uncapped because if the stock rallies hard... your puts expire worthless... but you protected against the downside.

The idea here is i can buy insurance for cheap because you are buying super short term puts to protect your calls which are up hundreds of percent.  I see this working because you are protecting only against a tight window and you are getting the puts cheap.

Thoughts?

My logic sound or flawed?

Thanks in advance..._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ DNMR: bullish on this bioplastics company I have a habit of using left over small sums of money from investments to buy a few shares of stocks I want to track but not commit to. A bit ago I bought $56 of LOAK @14.00/share, which has IPO’d with **Danimer Scientific Inc** (DNMR is currently the ticker). This netted me 177% return as of last week. I recently put another $500 a few days ago. I'm poor, so that’s a general investment amount for me per stock. DNMR is currently at $39.39.
 
Despite the recent run up I think it’s a great candidate for a long term hold. Hoping to get feedback from others here as I am less than a year into investing and since it’s a newer IPO there isn't as much readily available financial information as there is for other stocks (EPS etc.) I'm bullish on the concept of a bioplastic that decomposes in salt water, as that has been a main criticism of other bioplastic products that do not perform under such conditions.

IT TOOK ME A FEW HOURS TO MAKE THIS SPREADSHEET AND I WOULD LIKE TO HELP AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE. I SEE A LOT OF PEOPLE OPENING AND DUPLICATING THE SHEET, PLEASE HELP PAY IT FORWARD.**

Disclaimer: I originally created this tool for WSB, but it looks like I am muted there for some reason, so I figured I would share on some other subs where people are also talking about GME.

This whole experience has been (and will be) a crazy trip, but you don't want to be the one caught holding the bag when it eventually comes crashing down to earth. **HAVE AN EXIT STRATEGY.** Everyone has different levels of expendable capital and risk tolerance. Some of us can afford to YOLO away six-figure investments, while others would be more than happy to simply turn a few hundred dollars into a grand.

Your exit strategy should depend on how much money you are comfortable losing, and how much profits you would be happy taking. I'm not here to tell you what your strategy should be, but I did make a tool so you can figure it out for yourself: [Exit Strategy Calculator (Google Sheet)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13twJC8Ldy3p7iS7fp5htOjfhTYZIE_Fqa5Rn9wgqv8c/edit?usp=sharing)

&#x200B;

**HOW TO USE THE EXIT STRATEGY PLANNER**

\- Note 1: **This is for shares only**. I'm not smart enough to make this work for options.

\- Note 2: The link I provided is READ ONLY, so the first step is to **make a copy** for your own use (File --> make a copy)

\- **Now, enter your current position.** Provide the number of shares you have in A3, and your average cost basis in B3 (these cells are highlighted in yellow). Your total investment will automatically calculate in C3.

\- **Columns E-F are the ROI calculator.** Column F tells you what the share price will need to reach in order to hit the ROI listed in Column E. Column G tells you what your total value would be at that share price.

\- **Columns I-K are your break-even analysis**, which basically tells you what the share price would need to be for you to break even by selling X number of your shares, and what your profit would be if you sold all of them at said price. *You will probably want to adjust the #s in Column I based on how many shares you currently have in your position*. Columns J & K will automatically update when you do.

\- **Columns M-N calculate your profits at different share prices.** How much money will you make if you sell when GME hits $80? What about $100, or $250, or even $1,000? These columns will tell you. Feel free to adjust the share prices in column M if you want, but I have most of the big milestones covered.

\- **Columns P-R are your exit strategy planner.** *You will need to provide the following information: # of shares (if any) you want to hold long term, post-squeeze \[cell P4\]. Maximum dollar amount from your initial investment that you can stomach losing \[Q4\]. Profit amount you would be 100% happy cashing out with no FOMO of future gains \[R3\].* Cell Q6 will calculate your "worst case scenario" sell price. **Set a stop loss order at this price to maximize your losses** to the amount you entered in Q4, while still holding your desired # of long-term shares. Cell Q7 will calculate your "best case scenario" sell price. **Set a limit order at this price to cash out with your "100% satisfied profit"** you entered in R4, while still holding your desired # of long-term shares.

\- **Columns T-V is an incremental sales planner.** Some of you may want to sell a portion of your shares when certain benchmarks are hit (ie sell 10 shares when it hits $100, another 10 at $150, etc.). Simply enter in how many shares you want to sell at each price point \[column U\], and the sheet will calculate your cumulative revenues, net profit, and remaining shares.

TLDR: Use this spreadsheet to avoid getting caught holding the bag on GME when all of the shorts are officially squeezed. Make a copy for yourself and change the cells highlighted in yellow to account for your personal position and risk/reward preferences.

Of course you can use this spreadsheet for your other investments, but let's be honest... half of us seem to be all in on GME right now. Big week ahead, may all of our profits be plentiful!

**EDIT:** A few people have mentioned that the file traffic was too high and it was not allowing them to make a copy. Fear not! I have made some alternate sheets you can use instead (they are all the same).

Also: [Making Money in Best Reverse Mergers (and Cramer video)](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/jwu6sh/making_money_in_best_reverse_mergers_and_cramer/)

2020 saw the momentum-based realization of a few blockbuster event-level "IPO pops": Nikola (NKLA), Hyliion (HYLN), Velodyne Lidar (VLDR), Lordstown Motors (RIDE), and ChargePoint (future CHPT).  Capstoning these was the unprecedented hype of QuantumScape (QS).

Jim Cramer's statement of "maybe make some money" was an understatement, as common shares, warrants, and options each provide money-making opportunities that surpassed what can be found in a traditional IPO pop, including Snowflake's!

Options trading on these particular "IPO pops" has the potential for gains rivalling historical IPO pop gains such as the 195% of nCino (NCNO) and the dot-com record 698% of VA Linux.

2021 already saw the realization of at least two more such "IPO pops": Stem Inc. (future STEM) and Lion Electric (future LEV).

Despite all these blockbuster event-level "IPO pops," only one so far has reached $50 and beyond ($58.66) before changing to the operating company's ticker.  [This is none other than Hyliion (HYLN)](https://www.wsj.com/articles/no-revenue-no-problem-wall-street-rushes-into-electric-car-and-truck-startups-11603286077):

> [Blake Denton] learned about Hyliion, which plans to mass produce electric drivetrains for semi-trucks, while looking through posts on the online message board Reddit. The company announced a deal to go public in June by merging with a [reverse merger company] and buzz began to grow online, with some thinking it could be the next Nikola.

> “I had invested in Hyliion on pure hype—literally pure hype,” Mr. Denton said. “I knew nothing about the company.”

> He said he sold after the price went up and made about $50,000.

Momentum trading during late last year, and also during the early part of this year, showed that the rest of 2021 has the potential to change all that and add more tickers.  The rest of 2021 has the potential to apply the Hyliion Strategy.

Right after that is the [EV charging technology provider EVBox Group (future EVB)](https://news.evbox.com/en-WW/about/).

Then there is the [electric bus pure play Proterra (future PRTA)](https://www.proterra.com/company/investors/), but to paraphrase Jim Cramer, there has yet to be a cooling off from those levels before the "IPO pop."  Don't FOMO.

Not long after is the [EV charging stations play EVGo (future EVGO)](https://www.evgo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/evgo-investor-relations-presentation-final.pdf), but Cramer's words of wisdom apply here, too.  Don't FOMO.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)
Lupus Nephritis (LN)

Voclosporin to treat Lupus Nephritis received the PDUFA approval from the FDA late on Friday Jan 22nd, around 7:23 pm. This drug is significantly superior to the only alternative treatment and reported twice the efficacy of the current standard of care. Because of this this it was given priority review status by the FDA.

**Lupus Nephritis: A Disease With Only One Recently Approved Treatment**


Lupus Nephritis (LN), a debilitating and often deadly progression of SLE, is an inflammation of the kidneys caused by progression of an autoimmune disorder called, Systemic Lupus Erythematosus ("SLE"). According to the Lupus Foundation of America, approximately 1.5 million Americans (mostly women) and about 5 million people worldwide have a form of lupus. Aurinia estimates that 445,000 people in the U.S. suffer from SLE, and of these, approximately 60% will develop LN.

**TOTAL ADRESSABLE MARKET**


As we've seen before, an estimated 445,000 people currently suffer from SLE in the US. Of these, about 60% will end up developing LN, so we have a population of LN affected of around 267,000.

According to the last Aurinia CC, the Company estimates an annual cost per patient of approximately $90,000.
With this data we can estimate a maximum potential revenue to treat LN in the US of about $2.4 billion per year.

**HIGHLIGHTS**


-	At 50% market penetration of the drug in the US you can expect revenue of $1.2 billion per year from the US alone.
-	AUPH has a current market cap of 1.8 billion only. With these potential revenues, we can estimate a maximum potential value for Aurinia, applying a conservative P/S ratio of 4, of about $4.8 billion. (Roche and Pfizer sit at P/s of about 4).
-	They have signed a collaboration and license agreement with Otsuka Pharmaceuticals for the rights to Japan and Europe. They received cash as well as 10% - 20% royalties. 
-	Received an FDA patent extension until 2038 due to a dosing method with the drug. They have exclusive rights to this treatment for 17 years folks.

Thanks in advance._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ (MP) Mountain Pass CRITICAL to the national defense of the United States. So here’s my discussion on MP or Mountain Pass Mine.

Basically, my reason for believing it’s undervalued and a solid buy centers around the idea of “strategic reserve” and national defense. 

The definition of strategic reserve, according to Wikipedia, is “the reserve of a commodity or items that is held back from normal use by governments, organisations, or businesses in pursuance of a particular strategy or to cope with unexpected events.”  The major unexpected event that governments keep reserves for is typically conflict. 

The United States keeps strategic reserves of a lot of resources including but not limited to: gold, helium, grain, uranium, and most commonly referenced is our Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR). 

Just for an idea of a strategic reserve, I’ll dive into the SPR.  We have “proven reserves” which are natural deposits of oil that are tapped by oil companies to sell to the government and public.  To add to the SPR, the government buys this oil and pumps it back into the ground at facilities where they know it will sit.  The SPR is the the largest emergency supply of oil in the world.  Around 635 million barrels are currently kept in underground salt domes (natural tanks) across Louisiana and Texas.  These facilities are heavily guarded with a military presence. According to Oilprice.com, American oil (WTI) is trading at $53 a barrel. That’s $33.6 billion dollars we are sitting on...  Crazy, right? That’s just the US government alone, and not counting Exxon, Chevron, and every other oil companies’s reserves.  

So what does this have to do with MP? Unlike oil where we have hundreds of active oil fields spread across North America (proven reserves), massive tanks farms, and strategic reserves, there is just one rare earth element mine in the United States. What and where?  It’s Mountain Pass Rare Earth Mine located in Southern California!!! 

How does this connect to national defense? Rare earths are essential for catalyst, ceramics, magents, etc. Hell, they even use them as catalyst in oil production.  In addition, rare earths are required in almost every major weapon system in the arsenal of the most powerful military the world has ever seen.  We use these elements in everything from multi-roll stealth fighters, to Abrams main battle tanks, to laser range finders for the lone infantry soldier.  There are hundreds, if not thousands, of battlefield applications in the high-tech military of the United States for rare earths.  One F-35 Lightening II needs 920 pounds of rare-earth materials. Over 2500 F-35s have been ordered. That’s over 2.3 million ponds of rare earths for one project!!!  I couldn’t find how much an Abrams or Stryker needs specifically, but it has to be tons considering the technology in them, especially the Abrams using depleted uranium for its armor and the electronics that both platforms house. 

Rare earths are not just essential for weapon systems. They are becoming ever more important in the energy sector, which plays a huge roll in national defense itself.  According to the Australian rare earth miners Lynas Rare Earths, “the wind turbine market is expected to account for approximately 30% of the global growth in the use of rare earths magnets from 2015 to 2025.” Keep in mind that’s just wind turbines.  Rare earths go into making the glass for solar panels, too. 

In conclusion, MP’s market cap of $5.5 billion is absolutely RIDICULOUS, AND I DON’T UNDERSTAND WHY IT IS SO UNDERVALUED!!!   MP is the ONLY RARE EARTH MINE IN THE COUNTRY!!!!!!!!  WTF is it at $5.5 billion?  I’m surprised no major bank or fund sees this, but hey, I could be wrong. Maybe I missed something in my research, but it feels unlikely.    One thing I am sure about is that with the ever increasing high tech approach our society is taking with life, rare earths are going to continue to become more important whether directly to or in support of the national defense.  

TLDR; MP is grossly undervalued, and is essentially a publicly traded strategic reserve of rare earths.  

Position; 110 shares at $30.73. Considering doubling position. 

Tell me if this sounds reasonable, because I do have a theory why it’s low, but I don’t want to waste my time if you think what I put above is already shit.  Also, the rand.org source I used is pretty crazy and worth a look if you’re interested.

I’m relatively new to stock purchasing so I know that there is pre market purchase and I am kind of familiar with it but I’d like an explain like I’m 5 haha. Is it generally better to purchase during pre market or wait till the market opens to see if there is any kind of early on dip? Or just purchase right as market opens. Thank you!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Everything you need to know about Shorting: Ratio, Float, Interest, Squeeze Thanks to GME, I graduated yesterday with my Bachelor’s Degree in Short Knowledge from YouTube University.

Gather around kids, I am now ready to become a professor. First to understand shorting ratios, you need to know what outstanding shares are. There are two:

**Shares Outstanding**

The TOTAL NUMBER of shares a company has. Period. It includes: Owners, Insiders, Institutional, shares that are locked up, Available to general public, etc.

**Shares Float**

The total amount of shares to TRADE in the general Stock Market.

Pretend: Stock XYZ has *400M shares float*, *50M shares shorted*, and *daily volume of 10M shares*. Now, let’s finally get to the shorting.

**Short Ratio**

The number of *days* it would take ALL the shorts to cover their positions.

* Formula is: Shorted/Volume, so in this case: 50/10 = 5. It will take 5 days for ALL shorts to cover their positions if they were to do so.

**Short Float**

What percentage of AVAILABLE shares (Shares float) are currently being shorted.

* Formula is: ((Shorted/Available) \* 100) shares. So, (50/400) \* 100 = 12.5%.

**Short Interest** **(Shares Shorted)**

Pretty much like Short Float. The quantity of stocks that investors have sold short but not yet covered or closed out.

**Short Squeeze**

When stock price rises and the investors who shorted the stock are in RED getting a margin call. They have to immediately buy back the stock to close their position.

But… how will they close GME? The diamond hands aren’t selling. They’re riding it to the moon.

Ticker is IFRX. Price $ 5.70

https://www.inflarx.de

Current market value is approximately $ 160 million at a price of 5.70

They have a lot in pipeline (see attached picture). If some of them are approved, it is likely that the price will rise sharply. They have 112 million in cash, so at the moment you buy almost at intrinsic value.

Their CEO has 1 million shares and did not sell even when the price was at $ 50

Their competitor CCXI (Chemocentryx) now has a product on the market and has risen sharply from $ 9 in November 2019 and is now at $ 64 with a market value of $ 4.38 billion.

If you play optimistically with the idea, some numbers could look like this for IFRX

Market value: $ 500million = 17.50
Market value: $ 1 billion = 35
Market value: $ 2 billion = 70
Market value: $ 3 billion = 105

The upside is potentially insane if they end up with just a little of what they have on the program.

What would be your picks for growth stocks which are undervalued from a fundamentals perspective and have a lot of room to grow? I do see Blackberry (BB) as being undervalued currently. 

Basically trying to get suggestions for stocks you think have significant growth potential but haven’t rocketed thus far. 

Thanks_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ What’s the story with all these alternative energy stocks being over $1,000 a share 10 years ago coming back now? I noticed lots of people talking about stocks like  Fuelcell and Blink Charging Co recently. When I looked up the stock price 10 years ago it was over $1,000! Right now they are trading under $50. Does anyone know the deal with these stocks and why all of a sudden they are back from the dead after 10 years? Will they hit those highs again?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ DD for bb, Why I think BB would be a 200 billion company eventually 1, blackberry qnx RTOS had been installed on over 175 million cars globally, but this is not the recurring revenue and it is sold by licensing fee by piece. Among those 175 million legacy cars, about 5 dollars per licensing fee, that is the reason why BB stock price was so low in the past years.  

2, But with the blackberry gene of safety, security and mobility, of course with the Iso 26262 and safety highest level, link is following https://blackberry.qnx.com/en/resource-center/qnx-certifications,  qnx is embedded in Qualcomm and NVIDIA with long time partnership. So blackberry consolidate ability of the communication and computing, and control the first hand data generated inside the cars.

 Some guys don't believe qnx as OS is working on  nvidia, please Google It. It is official declaration in 2018.  Link is this https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2018/nvidia-announces-world-first-functionally-safe-ai-self-driving-platform

3,  with those first hand data, blackberry is a emerging big data company, so the exclusive partnership with Amazon leads to the blackberry Ivy platform which will be provided to the carmakers based on a subscription monthly fee, and which would be 55 split between blackberry and Amazon. 

4,  why carmaker would need this blackberry Ivy platform? In coming future all carmakers will be a fleet of cars, all cars would be sold near costs and carmakers will survive from the subscription fee from the carowners. Link is here from the boss of the NVIDIA, https://europe.autonews.com/automakers/nvidia-ceo-says-software-will-soon-define-car-drive-profit

5, the recurring subscription fee from carmakers will be only a part of the recurring revenue for  blackberry, there is another recurring revenue from the cyber security section which is now wp. 29 (link follows https://blackberry.qnx.com/en/regulations/wp-29-vehicle-cybersecurity/),  and beyond that is  ISO/SAE 21434 which is a totally new still under draft, and cross standards of the connected cars. 

If someday Tesla declare that they will cooperate with blackberry, that is the necessary step from my view. 

Think further and look forward, all the automotive industry will be inspired and reinvented by Tesla, such as  by creating new business mode. 

But for the specific function of the car especially for the passenger use, it replys on the safety and security heavily which is a policy and regulation oriented, HUGE MOAT. 


Thanks_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ How to Value Growth Stocks? Evaluating a growth stock is not an linear task. But it is quite relevant, especially in this market where tech and growth stocks have appreciated a lot and it is difficult to understand whether the company, in which we believe to have fantastic growth potential, is well valued.

The most common indicators, such as the PE and PEG ratios, are based on the company's profits. However, in the case of growth stocks, companies are still in investment stages and therefore have any or little profits. Tesla, for example, took years to make a profit, but not without having significantly multiplied its stock price.

Therefore, in the case of growth stocks, the comparison of price with sales seems to be a better indicator. In this case, the PSG ratio (price-to-sales growth: calculated by dividing price to sales ratio by the expected sales growth rate in coming years) seems to be a good option because it evaluates how priced is the stock comparing with its sales growth capacity.

Studies show that companies that have a PSG between 0.0 and 0.2 have historically outperformed the market.

To test this indicator at current market, I applied it to nearly 100 growth stocks with an average growth above 10% in the last 2 years. I also considered market cap on December 31, 2020 and sales growth rate as the average growth value from 2018 to 2021.

From the results, I highlight the top 10 and the bottom 10.

Once restrictions end with vaccinations we are going to see 30 years of growth in aircraft movements in around a year. We will have ave people who haven't holidayed in 2020/2021 suddenly bring able to do so. Those people will have unspent holiday money in the bank, airlines likely to offer cheap flights to kick start growth. Could this lead to a share increase in European low-cost carriers like easyJet???

I know alot of this depends on covid and the economy in general, but I work in aviation and we are all expecting rapid growth as soon as we approach 'new normal'. 

This is not a long term strategy for Europe - I think video conferencing is here to stay for business travel, and I have heard direct from someone senior in ICAO that the era of low-cost flights is about to end (peak oil and carbon). The prediction is that we will go back to like on the 70s when only rich people could fly, but I do suspect a huge short-term period of growth late 2021/2022 if we do get back to normality. (side note: China is building over 200 airports by 2035 and so there is a different story there).

I've been planning to buy my first stocks for a while and the GME squeeze seems like a fun (and potentially insanely profitable) way to start. I'm looking to place a market order for GME so that I can buy the stock as soon as the market opens, which I'm sure a bunch of you have done as well. However my 'free space' (not sure if that's the english term for it, my broker isn't in english) after transaction is way lower than it should be judging by my very elementary calculations (something like €120 per share instead of the €50 it seems to be at now).

Is this caused by the fact that a bunch of people are putting up orders, which is already driving the demand up? Or is it just my broker saying that the maximum I'd have to pay, no matter how unlikely, is around €120? If the latter is true, how likely is it I would end up paying ~€120 per share? Might still be worth it at that price but id prefer to know what I'm getting myself into before pulling the trigger on it. In case it's neither of these two things, lemme know.

Probably a dumb question about margin maintenance, apologies in advance. Also I did post this in the RH sub but it got auto-removed because it “has to do with taxes” (???). Apologies if it doesn’t belong here, I honestly just don’t know where else to put it.

I am currently utilizing about $8,000 of margin in my RH account. Roughly 1/4 of my portfolio consists of low-volatility (25%) stocks based on RH’s definition; roughly 1/4 are medium (50-60%), and the remaining 1/2 are all highly volatile (100%). I believe I purchased some of the highly volatile stocks on margin, as my margin maintenance isn’t far off from my total invested amount (around 10% less). Is margin maintenance based only on the stocks you’ve purchased using margin? Or is margin maintenance simply calculated based on the ratio of volatility across your entire portfolio?

I ask because I was wondering: if I closed some of my low-volatility and high-volatility positions, then immediately bought them back, making sure to buy the highly-volatile ones with my settled cash, then buy the low-volatility stocks back last (using margin), would this lower my overall margin maintenance amount? Or would it not change a thing?

If I were using $0.00 margin, then bought $8,000 worth of low-volatility stock, the maintenance would be much lower than if I bought $8,000 of highly-volatile stock. But it would seem like RH would indicate where specifically the margin is being utilized; the fact they do not show this would lead me to believe its based on an average of volatility of all positions. Is this incorrect thinking? If not, is there any reason I shouldn’t do this, just to lower the margin maintenance? I don’t hold positions very long before selling, so I’m not concerned about tax ramifications. I might lose/gain $10-20 in the process of selling/buying but it might be worth it just to lower the margin maintenance level.

I'm trying to use this as a learning tool as I move forward, so appreciate any & all advice._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ EpiPen Class Action Can Proceed;Mylan Loses Bid to Dismiss Lawsuit A U.S. district judge has ruled that a class action lawsuit against Mylan Inc., the marketer of the EpiPen auto-injector, and a group of pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) can proceed.
Mylan, now part of Viatris Inc., and the PBMs lost in a bid to have the Minnesota-based class action dismissed. The suit, brought by drug distributors, alleges that the Mylan and the PBMs conspired to engage in anticompetitive practices that drove up the price of EpiPens for mutual benefit.
Mylan has faced pricing controversy since it surfaced that the list price for a set of two branded EpiPens rose rapidly to $600 in 2016, an increase of more than 500 percent from 2008
PBMs usually negotiate favorable prices for their insurer clients, but the lawsuit alleges that instead the defendant PBMs accepted large rebates – described as kickbacks – from Mylan. In return, the suit contends the PBMs gave highly preferential treatment to EpiPen versus new auto-injector competitors (Auvi-Q and the generic version of Adrenaclick), which were either kept off insurer formulary lists or put in less favorable formulary tiers.

The PBMs and Mylan each argued separately that they did nothing outside of normal commercial business, and that the plaintiffs failed to make the case that they had violated the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) or, in Mylan’s case, also the Sherman Act. (The latter relates to unlawful behavior to maintain a monopoly.)
However, U.S. District Judge Eric Tostrud in Minnesota ruled that the “plaintiffs have stated plausible claims under RICO and the Sherman Act.” While Mylan and the PBMs contended they were pursuing their own “divergent goals” as businesses, Tostrud found that “the Complaint contains a fairly clear description of why Mylan and the PBM Defendants all had interests in keeping EpiPen prices inflated.”
Mylan argued as well that the plaintiffs’ claims exceeded a four-year statute of limitations, but Tostrud said dismissal on that basis would be “inappropriate” at this stage of legal proceedings

Even Burry sold 1m of GME shares under 15 $ in the third quarter. I won't be surprised if he has sold out all and the news comes out on Monday during market hours. That news itself will make stock dip 20% in a blink. Also don't forget that you could have forgotten this under 20$ 2 weeks ago, at 12$  2 months ago. Nothing has changed for this company. 

I also won't be surprised if the company offers huge secondary at 40.  This is like a last puff of the burning cigar. They will take the money and try to survive few more years and give themselves a chance. They need a lot of cash to get into new lines of business.

Guys,  by now many people think that TSLA valuation already has many things priced in, delivery numbers, energy storage solution, autopilot etc.  Even with all that priced in,  some people still think TSLA is still overpriced.

I, on the other hand, think that Elon still has a wildcard up his sleeve:  His star link service.  Imagine the vehicle can is a hot spot for all your devices or even a hot spot for your cabin in the wood whenever you visit (with your car).  With more than 12% of all drivers on the road (US) - at any given time - using the cell phone service,  TSLA can team up with a wireless provider and provide a WIFI call for their drivers for a small cut in profit (less load on cell towers).  TSLA can even make their own phone and has a phone service with minimal data/minute since WIFI callings don't count toward cell service.  That phone maybe a "cool"  factor for the younger crowd with their mode affordable 25k EV.


The car can have a true entertainment system on long trips,  kids can play online games with their peers etc.

My first "day trade" was on Friday, what a day lol. I turned my £800 to £1200, super happy for someone with no experience.

I used Trading212 **Invest**. What I noticed though is that when ordering I had to set the amount, and click confirm. I noticed on **CFD** you can just pre-set how many shares you want and click "Buy/Sell" instantly when you're ready, it's a lot faster which is needed for volatile stocks such as GME.

But I stayed away from CFD because I read online as a beginner I should go with Invest. But to be honest I really don't see the difference when it comes to day trading? I understand the main difference is that CFDs you buy without taking ownership, while investing lets you take direct ownership.

But really, what's the actual difference practically speaking? Is it really more risky for me?

NNOMF, Battery cost reduction+Longevity patent Hello Team.

This could be a chance to get in early before a MASSIVE run if suggestions end up be true in the next PR!

This  company, Nano One (NNOMF)  is a small, Canadian pre-revenue tech  company working to move its  patented process for making nano-structured  lithium battery cathode  materials to industrial scale production with  several major automotive  OEMs and battery supply chain players.

News  release quoted  “Mr. Dan Blondal (CEO) is pleased to announce that Nano  One has entered into a cathode evaluation and benchmark agreement with **an American based multinational auto manufacturer** to jointly evaluate Nano One’s cathode materials for automotive lithium ion batteries.”

Now  the CEO own words where  “major global EV leader“. So this leads up to  Tesla in best case scenario, which in the downside would be at least  Xpeng, Nio, GM... Win-Win situation seems achievable. Currently they  already are parthers of Volkswagen and Pulead (Top Li-ion battery  cathode producer).

Nano One is  in a strong financial position still, having been awarded a C$5 million  grant (boosted by another two allotments of C$250,000) from the Canadian  government and, on 2020, [February 24th, closed a C$11 million private placement](https://nanoone.ca/news/news-releases/nano-one-announces-closing-of-11-000-000-private-placement/?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link).

And doesn’t it make more sense to max out your pension instead? I keep reading about how you can use the power of compound interest by investing in the stock market to become a millionaire and retire early but it just doesn’t make sense to me.

if I invest £100 into a saving a account/pension and I get 10 percent interest, I’ll end up with £110 at the end of the year.

Next year the 10 percent interest is applied to the new total so I get £121. The extra £1 is due to compounding.

Now with stocks, I by 1 share worth £100, that share goes up 10 percent and now it’s at £110. Cool!

But now in order for that to compound similarly to the pension it doesn’t just need to go up 10 percent next year, it needs to go up 11 percent, then 12, then 13, 14, 16, 18, 21 etc

Now maybe if you’re a genius/lucky you might be able to pick a stock that keeps growing like that, but it seems unlikely for a portfolio.

So am I misunderstanding something or is compounding interest pretty much an impossibility with stocks?

Unless you’re already rich with a huge starting capital and have maxed out your yearly pension contribution, I have no idea how the stock market is worth it. For regular average people like me it seems entirely pointless to use it over a standard pension unless I put everything on one stock and bet big_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Why would you sell covered calls on a highly volatile stock that you want to hold long term? Aren't you betting against your own intuition and risking your position for pennies on the dollar? Hello, I recently funded an account with a new brokerage to start messing around with options. I have 250k MSFT in my main portfolio at a brokerage I'm not approved to trade options with yet. I've decided to use PLTR to test the waters with skimming premiums before I employ the strategy on my main.

From what I can tell, selling a covered call is a bearish play against the underlying. I bought 200 shares of PLTR, with which to sell covered calls. I sold 2 calls at .59 at a strike price of 40 expiring 2/19. My plan is to skim premiums from highly OTM options. Isn't this quite... stupid, for lack of a better word? The company has the three most important dates since it DPO'd all coming before expiration, implying possibility of high volatility. It jumped 25% yesterday. I realize I didn't pick an optimal call to sell. Risking 200 shares of a company I believe in for $.59*200 seems silly to me. If I sell at 45 I'll be hit with hundreds in taxes to jump back in. I'm also down a lot currently because the stock did just what I thought it would (went up).

Is there something I'm missing? Should you only ever be selling covered calls on relatively static companies like MSFT? Or did I simply create a shitty contract?

Finally, my gut reaction because I'm so bullish is to buy 100 shares at open on Monday. Is this a good idea for hedging against a stock you're bullish on that's rocketing toward your strike price? I can't sell cash-secured puts as all of my shares are locked up in the aforementioned covered calls.
