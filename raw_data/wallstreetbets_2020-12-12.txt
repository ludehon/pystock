 A little wordplay _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ QQQJ - $34k - fuck paying my Q4 Quarterly Estimates - YOLO _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ TSLA to the moon! Part 1 (the non DD) Alright ladies, boys, Bulls, and bears alike,

I've went ahead and took a good chunk of money and margin and done what we do best. ALL ON PAPA ELON.

Let me set the stage for you-->

I'm balls deep in TSLA calls, one sweet SPY put and you know damn straight I'm GME gang till I fucking die. #WEWANTCOHEN

Here's the spread:

TSLA:

12/18 $450 call +3

12/18 $610 call +2

12/24 $545 call +1

12/24 $520 call +1

1/15 $500 call +2

9/16/22 $300 call +1

SPY:

12/28 $335 put +23

Now I pull out my massive paintbrush. This is how I see it, it literally CAN NOT GO TITS UP. (Famous last words? TBD). there's 3  likely outcomes.

\#1. \[75% chance dubbed the Baseline\] Due to the massive demand from benchmark funds and tracking funds alike having to buy a little over 164 MILLION SHARES Tesla fucking skyrockets to 750 minimum by Friday 12/18. ( A 23.1527% increase) I sell everything friday, Take my money and leave the poker table  after calling their bluffs, \*cough pussies cough\*, and head over to and put it all on black GME for the win. (long fucking wait though its going to be bouncing around till April). Oh also the Spy calls expire worthless, but in reality who gives a fuck?

\#2. \[12.5% chance dubbed the Black swan\] Due to some unforeseen event. Tesla tanks despite the massive demand and buying pressure leading into Friday the 18th, but somehow the general market is largely unaffected and doesn't trigger my 8% hail merry FT(motherfucking)W spy puts and I lose everything. I then look longing at the closet, as i open the door to see my day 1, $rope, and flip a coin to see if today is the day.

\#3\[12.5% chance dubbed the golden goose\] Due to unforeseen event the psychology of the market takes a massive shit on itself from rebalancing portfolios and algorithmic bot traders proceed to shit the bed and dump all other stocks besides tesla and the market sees a massive +10% drop while TSLA, un wavered by the fools who thought technology could save it reaches to Mars because the moon was just too damn close. This triggers not only my spy puts raking in boat loads of cash but also sending my TSLA shares and options threw the proverbial roof. I also sell here and go see my boy #WEWANTCOHEN and proceed to take over the Gamestop board to help captain turn this bitchin' ship around.

So 1) Tesla's meteoric rise is taken into account. 2) if i shit the bed or market tanks and effects tesla i still profit. and 3) there's always the good ol' $Rope theory i hear so much about. I Literally cant see how this can all go tits up. With impending government lockdowns, fed programs ending, Jpow turning the printer off, the stimulus on hold, and all eviction memorandums coming up the end of December, its looking really good for a nice lil correction.

Now, i know what you fucktards are going to say. "why so deep in the money? if you believe TSLA is hitting 700 minimum Friday, why so much capital upfront?"

Answer: Because all of this isn't just for fun, i like to manage my risk. Because WINNING is much more important to me than loss porn. if any issues see Link #3.

or Maybe the good old "why are you buying so many different strikes?"

answer: different strikes bought on different days and different accounts and I'm still learning/adapting.

I'm going to do the DD post with the same name and tittle is part [2. So](https://2.So) am i missing anything?

TLDR: TSLA GO MARS FRIDAY. HOLD CALLS TILL FRIDAY. GROFIT.

EDIT: thanks to u/psycobusa who brought up an excellent point on my second post, and i did some research it seems if you have any 12/18 calls they will expire worthless seeing as how the funds usually buy AFTER MARKET CLOSE on the day they have to add(thats friday)! (those fuckers). SO i will be rolling my 12/18 calls to 12/24 to profit and hopefully the dump monday morning isn't too bad so i can get mine off at 9:30 sharp! (research is from yahoo, etsy inclusions)_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ üöÄüöÄüöÄAFRM to da MOON - the IPO you don't want to sleep on üöÄüöÄüöÄ At this point, im pretty much giving up on trying to dip into IPOs so imma just throw out the research that I have done on it and why this one is just going to straight up open up at 200%+. If you can dip in at ipo pricing, this one is definitely going to be free tendies and you will hate yourself for sleeping on it. For those who cant participate in the ipo, you might want to look at Big Fu\*king Tendies which is going to merge with Paysafe and ill be posting a DD on that very soon so stay tuned. 

Buckle up my fellow retards cause today were going to be talking about Affirm IPO and how its about to bring us tendies through our weaponized autism. The company focuses on ‚Äúbuy now pay later‚Äù market along with other financial services. Affirm **demonstrates serious potential with solid 98% yoy growth with narrowing losses** and **a disruptive business model that creates a mutual win-win situation between the merchants and the customers** by undercutting the traditional financing cost and bringing more sales to merchants. With the **recent acquisition of PayBright, a Canadian buy now pay later provider, Affirm is looking to expand aggressively and to increase market domination in the sector by increasing the targeted region, larger and more diverse merchant network and reach to more users**. Affirm is set to gain 7000 merchants and thereby increasing the reach to more potential long-term customers. Affirm is also looking for more expansion via **deep integration partnership with shopify to power shop pay installments. (shopify actually owns 5% of affirm)**

What is Affirm?

Affirm is a latest fintech company that mainly focuses on the ‚Äúbuy now pay later‚Äù market while providing various other services such as saving account and virtual card. The goal of the Affirm is to be as ubiquitous, secure and convenient as legacy networks, yet far more transparent, honest and both consumer and merchant centric. Affirm currently **has more than 6.2M+ consumers, 6500+ merchants, a 64% consumer retention rate, 100% merchant retention rate and a Gross Merchandise value of 10.7Bil since 2017 with a whopping 77% growth from 2.6bil to 4.6bil from 2019 to 2020.** With the traditional credit and debit cards are designed to butt plug and milk the crap out of consumers as consumers paid approximately $121 billion in credit card interest, $11 billion on overdraft fees and $3billion in late fees and does very little to assist merchants to overcome the two biggest challenges; the cost of acquire a customer and the cost to convert a sale. **With Affirm, consumers benefit from having access to 0% APR financing or a financing plan that is more affordable and more transparent than the credit card rate and little to no penalties to late payments. The merchants benefit from having more customers and better conversion due to the lower rate. Under partnerships with Affirm, dollar-based merchants‚Äô retention has consistently exceeded 100% for each cohort of merchants that joined and merchants also reported 92% and 85% higher average order value in 2018 and 2019.** 

**Service Provided**

**1)** **Buy now pay later (with special financing options from partnered merchants)**

**2)** **Virtual card (works just like credit and debit account which grants you the buy now pay later option to any non-participated merchants)**

**3)** **High interest saving account** 

**The revenue source of Affirm is built upon**

**1)**  **Merchant fees with larger merchant fees on 0% APR financing products (0% APR financing represents 43% and 46%)**

**2)** **Interest income on simple interest loans from originating bank partners of consumer purchases** 

**3)** **Portion of the interchange fee from the transaction through virtual card which provides flexibility and essentially cheap credits to users by allowing customers to shop with merchants that may not yet be fully integrated with Affirm** 

Future Projection:

With the dying retail stores and rapid adaption of e-commerce from Gen Z and Millennials, global online sales grew 20% to approximately $3.4 trillion in 2019 and is expected to grow to approximately $5.8 trillion by 2023. As more and more people moving purchase online on top of the pandemics we are facing today, e-commerce has become one of the most rapid growth markets in the past few years **with the ‚Äúbuy now pay later‚Äù being the fast fastest growing e-commerce payment method globally. In North America, ‚Äúbuy now pay later: market share is expected to triple 3% of the e commerce payments market by 2023 and with other regions already accounts for 6% of the e commerce payment market and is expected to soar to almost 10% by 2023. With the acquisition of paybright which provides affirm access to 7000+ more merchants and the deep integration with shopify, expect affirm to do be a money printing machine down the road.**

**Overall, banking on the poor via cheap and accessible credits in general is an economic concept that has been tested over and over again in various countries to be extremely profitable and beneficial to the overall economic. With cheap and accessible credits, one could also expect higher demand for products with higher price tags. It is no surprise that most partnered luxury brands offer 0% APR financing options and one should expect to see more partnerships with luxury brands coming soon. As a result, expect this shit to do very well in the future.**

&#x200B;

Potential downside?

On the SEC filing, they have listed that the peloton sales currently make up about 28% of the revenue. At the first glance, it may seem like a really bad news, however, such could also be interpreted as a working business model doing what its intended to do as stated above. In the case of Peloton, it shows that with the access to cheap credits, people are more willing to make big purchases and merchants could benefit tremendously from the increase in demand from it. 

&#x200B;

TLDR: Shit gonna moon. 100% yoy growth and narrowing net loss. Expanding aggressively with shopify to leverage on. FK BOOMER BANKS._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Tesla Idling Production Line for Model S & X for 18 days It was already going to be a wild ride for TSLA this week.  The questions this move raises should make it even more...fun.  From CNBC:

>[Tesla](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=TSLA) informed employees in its Fremont, California, factory on Friday that its Model S and Model X electric vehicle production lines will close from December 24th to January 11th, according to an email seen by CNBC.  
>  
>Employees working on those lines were offered a full week of pay to cover one of the two and a half weeks of the shutdown, along with a few paid holidays. They were asked to take 5 unplanned and unpaid days off, but have the option to try to find work in other areas of the factory during those days.  
>  
>They were also encouraged to ‚Äúvolunteer‚Äù to help make electric vehicle deliveries to customers during the shut down.

The article notes that Musk has said in a separate email to all employees that "the company is ‚Äúfortunate to have the high-class problem of demand being quite a bit higher than production this quarter‚Äù and asked for employees to increase production as much as possible during the rest of the quarter."

Is the company seeing demand for the high end (and high margin) products wane?  Are they pushing through upgrades?  And most importantly, what does the stock do this week in advance of the S&P inclusion?

Please notice $BJ is trading at a P/E way below $COST, and an RSI suggesting this stock is oversold. The float is about a quarter of the size of $COST with nearly 14% being shorted. Me thinks that if this sucker starts moving it will move quickly as shorts try to cover.

I'm mostly fascinated how $BJ is consolidating nicely and holding it's support line. It's 200 SMA is inching closer, as $BJ is trading just 5% above it's 200 SMA. I'm playing the bounce with 10%+ upside in the short term.

A little over a month and a half ago I saw a rocket ship.  
I climbed aboard with my fellow autists and bought Calls without doing any research at all.  
I didn't even know the actual name of the company.  
I only knew, "PLTR is going to the Moon!"  
I bought a fist full of calls and strapped in.

This last Tuesday, my dog was faced with a difficult emergency surgery.  
I had to find $6,200 with less than a weeks notice or he would face losing his eye or possibly his life.  
A deep and sincere thanks to all of my fellow autists and PLTR.  
I let go of a couple 1/15 $19 Calls to make it happen.  
He is alive and well with both eyes. (Extremely poor sight on the right eye.)

I really can't thank all of my fellow retards enough for saving my dog.

Of the 301 responses received so far, 176 had IDs that matched the first survey and were legit responses. This is after correcting IDs for typos, missing/extra spaces, and missing/extra numbers. So the data is very clean.

The results are still extremely bullish:

* Only 8% of respondents sold (possible selection bias)
* On average, respondents increased shares by 12%
* 98% of respondents would support Ryan Cohen in replacing the board of directors. 2% were not sure, 0% would keep the existing board

For anyone holding calls, you can take solace in the fact that even if the flight went well, the stock price will drop on Monday regardless.


This failure to launch provides the company with a unique opportunity to show they can do a quick engine swap and fly again in the next few days.


On Twitter the company even said:
‚ÄúEarly update on flight: The ignition sequence for the rocket motor did not complete.  Vehicle and crew are in great shape. We have several motors ready at Spaceport America. We will check the vehicle and be back to flight soon.‚Äù


If they can nail this turnaround, it‚Äôll be even better than just a successful flight.


Positions: a couple 1/15/21 20 & 30 calls left + January 2022 calls._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Amazon.com: Overvalued, undervalued, fairly valued? Ladies and gentlemen,

it's your boy chimpu with the trading range for the upcoming week, SPY between 200 and 8.000, personal bias moon.

Now that I got your attention I want to present you a lengthy (yawn) analysis of Amazon (AMZN) stock. For the tl;dr look out for the rockets. Seriously, some lost components of that SPCE rocket might fall onto you so watch out.

I spare you from why Amazon is the obvious winner this year, we all know that. My focus rather is on valuation and also a little bit of TA (I know it's bogus but good enough for confirmation bias).

So from a valuation standpoint of view Amazon has gained 68,65% ytd. This seems like a good bull run outperforming the broader market. However, since the beginning of July, the stock started to trade sideways not gaining any traction to the upside.

[YTD performance](https://preview.redd.it/7athhpnnds461.png?width=1515&format=png&auto=webp&s=037cc4d739a1ce7867c645318e770a7d24b571b3)

However, those 68% do not tell the true story. We have to look back to the 19th February 2020. The stock closed at $2.170. Days and weeks later, the rona crashed the market and Amazon went down with it (to the 1600s). From the pre-rona high till Friday close (Dec 11), Amazon gained *only* 43,7%.

[pre-rona till today gain](https://preview.redd.it/u7bcxq5afs461.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=2dbb287cdaeeb247f42ea7037723630f42d677bd)

That is, in all honesty not the best performance in the market considering the stellar rise of the Snowflakes, Nios, Palantirs, Fastlys & co. And I don't want to compare these stocks with Amazon, because Amazon of course fights against the law of the large numbers and is a 1.6T dollar behemoth that moves slower by nature.

Btw: The yellow line above seems like a good trend line being a support several times in recent weeks, doesn't it?

Now, valuation:

The classical valuation metric is P/E ratio. Amazon currenty trades at a 91 P/E ratio on a trailing twelve months basis. This is slightly above the historical average during the last 2 years or so (I don't want to talk about 2015 when there were no earnings or when it traded at a 1000 multiple).

[TTM P\/E ratio](https://preview.redd.it/6nqmxgjqgs461.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=91895116667b2fe9de1319018e66441b080e0ca8)

For a FY2020 prediction we have to look into the guidance that Amazon gave us, which - if we take the middle of it - would lead us to about the same TTM EPS by the end of FY2020 and therefore the same P/E ratio (\~90). Amazon, using these numbers wil report about $17.5 bn in earnings.

That 90 P/E ratio may sound more expensive than it was pre-Covid, but it misses one vital fact: The Covid-related extra expenses + the money Amazon invested into its business in 2020 ([amazon grows physcial space by 50% in 2020](https://www.inddist.com/company-expansion-consolidation/news/21142476/amazon-expects-to-grow-its-physical-space-by-50-this-year)). At least Covid-related costs are temporary only and thus in the mid-term future these extra expenses will be additional pure cash on Amazon's earnings statement. But how high were those extra costs related to the rona? Adding up the sum Amazon itself expected in their Q1, Q2 and Q3 2020 report this reaches $10 bn (4+2+4bn), see [Amazon's Qs reports](https://ir.aboutamazon.com/quarterly-results/default.aspx). So the (conservative, as Amazon always crushes earnigns guidance and eastimates in recent times) $17.5 bn + $10 bn would sum up to $27.5 bn earnings. Let's assume Amazon doesn't grow earnings in 2021, with a stock price of $3100 that would now lead us to a forward P/E ratio of 56,7. Now that doesn't seem too expensive anymore for a company that will this year grow revenues by about 35% and just having grown their Q3 earnings 96% YoY.

Assuming above that Amazon's earnings will stall, while Amazon's revenue growth definitely will slow in 2020, this almost definitely won't be the case for earnings in 2021 due to the effects mentioned above. Other effects propelling Amazon's earnings higher will be classical economy of scale arguments, e.g. cost efficiency in the logistics department as Amazon continues to build its own cost saving delivery infrastucture. Another factor for that is that the business segments with the highest margins will be the ones growing their revenue the most, namely AWS, the ad segment and the recurring prime subscription fees.

Amazon's recent move into the pharmacy business should not be disregarded but isn't even necessary to drive Amazon's numbers higher.

And we should also expect Amazon to blow out earnings. They will beat to the upside both top and bottom line, driving numbers higher and multipes even lower. Use google trends to find out yourself with the [google trends search tool](https://trends.google.de/trends/explore?date=2019-09-01%202020-12-12&geo=US&q=%2Fm%2F0mgkg) (it is worth to be mentioned that the google trends search tool doesn't really reflect the growth, as the average basket size per order at Amazon grows as well as this feature of course only tracks people who go to google first and type "amazon" to go to their website instead of visiting it directly or - more important - using the app. It just gives you an idea).

***Approaching Amazon's valuation on a Cash flow based modell***

Above we approached valuation with an earnings-focused modell and saw that in the not too distant future Amazon will be able to slowly lower their earnings ratios approaching the likes of Apple, Alphabet or Miscrosoft (in the central or upper 30s).

However, if we ever based our investment decision about Amazon on a earnings multiple modell, the stock would have never been a buy and we missed out the entirety of this growth story. Therefore, in my opinion it is better to measure Amazon's value on a Cash-flow basis. This not only allows us to understand the actual profitability and margins of the business, but also shows how heavily Amazon invests in its business to expand and grow by all measurable figures.

Of the greatest interest to me is the Operating Cash Flow (OCF). Amazon's FY2017 OCF was $18.5bn and now is at about $52.2bn on a TTM basis. This is an incease of 176% in less than 3 years.

For comparison, Microsoft: MSFT's OCF at the end of theor fiscal year in June 2017 was at $39,5bn, now it is at $66,2bn, which is a growth of 67,6% in a time of 3,5 years.

Both are amazing growth rates, both are amazing companies, Amazon is a true growth stock and Microsoft sits somewhere between growth and value.

&#x200B;

If - again looking at the Cash Flow statement of Amazon above - one can see the immense amount of money Amazon is investing in its business. On a TTM basis this amounts to more than -$35bn Investing Cash Flow. And as I mentioned above, we can physically see this growth and these costs looking at the porches of the sUbUrBaN wOmEn'S houses drowning in Amazon parcels. This amount of parcels can only be delivered by expanding the logistics infrastructure, warehouse capacity and workforce. And this expansion is right there above, in the TTM Investing Cash Flow -$35bn. Once Amazon has grown to a fully unfolded, mature company with the groundwork being laid years ago, these investing expenditures will decrease and in combination with further economy of scale synergies their earnings will be propelled higher and higher.

But we are right now nowhere near a truly mature Amazon. With the growth rates Amazon has today, it will be the largest listed company of the US rather sooner than later.

***Now an itzy bitzy of TA***

Look at the first chart I posted at the very beginning of the analysis. You see a tightening triangle. Amazon bounced of the lower support time several times in recent weeks building higher lows. At the same time Amazon made lower highs since the Sept. 2 "crash". Amazon is poised to breakout soon. Last week was calendar week 50. Calender week 50 is from a historical perspective Amazon's worst by far. That being behind us now leaves us with a stronger momentum, especially when Christmas is over and with regards to the upcoming FY2020 report late January.

Short term, Amazon also made some green hammers into the close on Thu and Fri which leaves me hopeful on a strong momentum for next week if not the Pfizer vaccine news crashes the stay-at-home-stocks entirely (Amazon unjustified as it did not rally some 500% like those mentioned before but rather 43%). But: No matter what might happen in the short or medium term, Amazon will be on a moon mission with papa Bezos being rocketman on his dick shaped space needle.

By now, we all know/believe stocks have priced in a second round of stimulus (at least it should be considering the "stimulus talks going well" pump has been on repeat since the end of summer). Based on the assumptions below, I am inclined to believe gold is moving higher in the near term, regardless of whether stimulus gets passed in Congress.

**ASSUMPTIONS:**
1) Equities have priced in a second round of stimulus.
2) Increased money supply (M1) causes inflation.
3) Gold is historically a hedge against inflation and equity markets.

If you look at GLD's 6 month chart, the 52 week high (~194) occurred on August 6th. Since then, the ETF has dropped 11%. During the same timeframe, SPY has gained ~9.5% (remember we are assuming stocks have priced in a second round of stimmy). Seeing as though gold has dropped through this period, I am inclined to believe gold is NOT pricing in a second round of stimulus (at least not to the same degree stocks are).

Reason being: If gold was pricing in an increase in M1 supply, the price should have at least remained relatively flat from its August highs.

**Second Stimulus Outcomes**
We have two options - either we get more stimulus or we don't. Simple as that.

1) More Stimulus = Increased M1 supply = Greater inflation = *Gold increases in value*
2) No Stimulus = Unexpected event that was originally priced into equities = Stocks sell off and seek a safe store of value = Demand for gold increased = *Gold increases in value*

Now I know what many people may say..."But in March gold sold off along with stocks!" Yes, it did. And it was an anomaly. We were entering uncharted territory in March. Nobody knew what we were dealing with (in terms of the virus and economic impacts). That is different this time, we have a better understanding of what is happening. The old idiom holds true "better the devil you know than the devil you don't".

**TLDR:**
I see gold prices increasing regardless of the stimulus decision in Congress. Loading up on **GLD 2/19/21 $185c** (February because no matter what happens in the near term, Dems will pass more stimulus once Sleepy Joe is sworn in)

Thanks for coming to my Ted talk._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Intrinsic value of Lumen (LUMN) with possible 10X return. Last time I tell you chumps about this one. Look, I know everyone here only cares about high tech meme stocks valued at 10X the entire market for their shitty products. But if you have the tiniest amount of patience there might be an opportunity with limited downside to capitalize on a severely undervalued company according to many analysts including Michael Burry, the autist from The Big Short.   
   
Here are some choice quotes from The Investors Podcast (linked below):   

"So our premise really is that as long as people wake up to the fact that the core assets of Level 3 are worth what they are worth in the private market for, let‚Äôs say, around $34 billion. And as long as people apply even some modicum of multiple to the remaining CenturyLink assets, you have a completely insane risk reward from 950 or whatever it‚Äôs trading at today. So that‚Äôs kind of some of the parts we look at how to value or approach value in the company. And again for us, it‚Äôs more about margin of safety. So our margin of safety really is that, look, if someone offered me $1.7 billion in cash flow today, and I only have to pay 10 billion to get it, I would take that bet. That‚Äôs it in a nutshell."   
  
There is also a rumor that the company might split its two businesses to capitalize on the multiple that its Level 3 infrastructure should be receiving:   
"I mentioned that we have this hypothesis that the company‚Äôs in the middle of splitting these two companies up and it‚Äôs messy. This was a messy merger. There are a lot of physical assets. There are little things that you have to figure out transfer pricing in between if you sell your fiber assets, if the company split the split off company is still using the fiber assets, you have to figure out transfer pricing. And so I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs simple, but given this is a company that people know, Seattle Seahawks Stadium is a CenturyLink field, right? And so this is a company people know, we have a CEO who is highly incentivized to create value for shareholders who‚Äôs done it before. And one more point, you go to their June, 2020 presentation for the first time we‚Äôd ever seen, they put in a slide that said, ‚ÄúHey, we know we have a $10 stock, but here are some appropriate multiples we have for our two businesses.‚Äù   

The estimate is $24-25 valuation based on a 4-5X fair multiple of EBITDA for this company:   
‚ÄúHey, so you have three billion in EBITDA here at Level 3, you have six billion EBITDA at CenturyLink, let‚Äôs put just conservative multiples on those illustrative of what these companies could be worth.‚Äù And so this is a company that had a $10 stock that was saying, ‚ÄúWe think we‚Äôre worth 24 to 35.‚Äù I mean, these are numbers that you almost don‚Äôt put out there because people think that‚Äôs so crazy."    

And maybe they are crazy. But options are so darn cheap that in my non-investment advice giving opinion its worth a flyer. There are two possible catalysts coming (1) announcement of splitting two companies up or (2) just outperforming expectations in Q1, which management is already on track to doing. The company has already consolidated debt significantly in the last year. Institutions own 79.6% of the stock, up 1.9% this quarter.  

Unlike you retards I can üíéüëê this straight through expiry. I have patience and I want to be ahead of the game. When you come fashionably late to the memestock party you just get dumped on. Patience. As Warren Buffet said "the money is made in the waiting."

Transcript https://www.theinvestorspodcast.com/episodes/tip326-intrinsic-value-of-lumen-with-ben-claremon-and-eugene-robin/_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ We should be close to herd immunity by March The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines should be enough for 22.5 million people per month.  Pfizer plans to distribute about 25 million doses in the U.S. by the end of the year (after some manufacturing challenges).  Moderna plans to distribute about 20 million doses in the U.S. by the end of the year.

Deaths due to Covid-19 in long term care facilities (39% of all Covid-19 deaths) should drop dramatically by February.  By the end of February 67.5 million people should be vaccinated, about 20% of the population.  Also, by the end of February around 30% of the population (around 100 million) will have already had Covid-19 and so have some natural immunity.  This 30% figure assumes we continue to have the same rate of infection, about 17 million per month, through February \[1\]. If you don't believe infection confers immunity you are retarded.  By March 145 million total should be protected (assuming 30% of the people receiving the vaccine have been infected previously).

By March we should be damn close to herd immunity.  This doesn't count potential vaccine supplies from Johnson & Johnson (should have results in January) and AstraZeneca (which had questionable results).  But this also assumes no new manufacturing issues (we already see Pfizer having some issues).

Why do folks say things won't get back to "normal" until June or later of next year?  When we have a good shot at hitting herd immunity by March?  Stonks go up.

 1. Record revenue this year, so much so that they are practically giving out free money to their employees for the company performance. 

2. With the rich getting richer in the pandemic, real estate buying is soaring (New york +200% sums it up)

3. With low interest rate mortgage lending is on the fucking high. JPOW confirms it will remaim this way for a year or two. 

4. No 1 in USA already. Expanding overseas. 

5. Main competitor $Rkt trading around 21$ (spiked till 40$ after merger). UWM is a much better company in terms of management/ reviews/ Glassdoor/ CSAT score/ future growth prospects analysis (check yahoo analysis). 

6. Sitting around the NAV at 11$ , maximum loss 10%, expected gain 120% atleast. 

7. Same management team as Luminar Lazr$, we all known how that went.

8. Cherry on top. They will also pay dividend which will make the boomers invest big. This is very unusual for a company that just went public. Shows their confidence in their financials. 

TLDR: Buy GHIV$, hold until January 1 week. I recommend buy stock at current level as only 10% downside.(Spac has floor at 10$). Hold till 20$- 22$. 100% Profit.üöÄüöÄ

Not an autist was stirring, no üåàüêª hubbub
The short dated calls were bought up with care
In hopes that St. Jerome soon would be there

The bulls were nestled all snug in their beds
While visions of lambos danced in their heads
And Tim Apple in his kerchief and Bezos in his cap
Had just settled down for a long winter's nap

When out on Wall Street there arose such a clatter
I sprang from the bed to see what was the matter
Away to the trading app I flew like a flash
Dumped all my money into ABNB and DASH

To the moon on the breast of the new-fallen SNOW
Gave the lustre of mid-day to all IPOs
When, what to my wondering eyes should appear
But a miniature fund of eight stonks I hold dear

With a little old driver, who calls the Fed ‚Äúhome‚Äù
I knew in a moment it must be St. Jerome
More rapid than eagles his printing it came
And he whistled, and shouted, and called them by name:

‚ÄúNow, TSLA! now, SPCE! now, TQQQ and PLTR!
On, MU! on SPACs! on, NIO and SQ!
To the top of the charts! till you‚Äôre the talk of the Wall!
Now üåï away! Moon away! Moon away all!"

As WSB memes that before they inevitably die
When they meet with any news, üöÄ to the sky
So up to the top-movers the stonks they flew
With the sleigh full of tendies, and St. Jerome too

And then, in a twinkling, I heard on the news
Rates would never be higher, till at least ‚Äò22
As I drew in some crayons, account turning around
Down the chimney St. Jerome came with a bound

He was dressed all in Herm√®s, from his head to his foot
It was apparent the man had never purchased a put
The entire global markets he had flung on his back
And he looked like he could out-print any attack

He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work
And filled all the accounts; then turned with a smirk
And laying his finger aside of his nose
And giving a nod, up the elevator stocks rose

He sprang to his printer, to his team gave a whistle
And out money flew like it was shot from a missile
But I heard him exclaim, ere he drove out of sight,
HAPPY WITCHMAS TO ALL, AND TO ALL A GOOD-NIGHT!

SPY 400c 1/15/2021_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Had to spread the retardation to my university class _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Introducing WSB Roulette! Randomly generated options plays because this is a casino! **Intro**

I'd like to present my latest waste of time, WSB Roulette! Since logic no longer applies with trading in 2020, why not let RNGesus help? This is a quick python script I put together that takes a list of tickers and generates some random options to help you lose your money without guilt. If you lose money with these trades, you can blame RNG instead of yourself! If you're feeling even more adventurous, there's an FD mode too!

**DISCLAIMER**

This script is purely for entertainment purposes and I will be not responsible for any losses your retarded plays get you!!


**How it works**  
More details available in the README in the Github repo, but here's the gist of it. You feed it a list of tickers you want to "invest" in. For each one, it randomly decides whether to make a call/put, selects a random expiration date and strike price and returns the relevant data. The script uses a library that uses the Yahoo Finance API for data which is limited to 1000 API calls per hour per IP address.

Activating FD mode restricts the returned options to those that are <2 weeks and 3-5 strikes OTM only. Otherwise by default, you have a chance of OTM, ATM, and ITM  options.

**Setup and Usage**  
You'll need Python 3.6+ installed. Download requirements.txt and wsbroulette.py from the Github repo. Open a command prompt, navigate to the directory you downloaded the files and install the requirements using

    pip install -r requirements.txt    

Script Usage:

    python wsbroulette.py -t TICKERS -b BALANCE [-e EXPIRATION RANGE] [-s STRIKE_RANGE] [-d DISTRIBUTION] [-f] [-beargang] [-bullgang]

Enter the list of tickers in parantheses and seperated by commas. Ex. "TSLA,GME,ROPE"

Balance is the maximum amount of $ you want to spend

EXPIRATION_RANGE is optional and controls what the maximum number of expiration dates are returned (Default = 4)

STRIKE_RANGE is optional and controls the range of strikes returned from the current underlying price (Default = 3)

DISTRIBUTION is optional and controls the randomness of allocation of funds between the tickers (Lower is more random, Higher is more even, Default = 10)

Add the -f flag if you want to engage FD mode! In FD mode, only the next 2 expiration dates are used. Options are also always OTM at 3-5 strikes out from underlying.

Add either the -beargang or -bullgang flag if you want to only generate puts or calls, respectively



**Example Usage**

    python wsbroulette.py -t "TSLA,PLTR,GME,NIO" -b 50000 -e 2 -s 5

This generates 4 options for TSLA, PLTR, GME, NIO with a total bankroll of up to $50,000. It will only use up to the next 2 expirations because FDs are life. The strike price will be in the range of +/- 5 strikes from the current underyling price.

    python wsbroulette.py -t "TSLA,PLTR,GME,NIO" -b 50000 -f

FD MODE! Generate 4 options for TSLA, PLTR, GME, NIO with a bankroll of $50k. Options are OTM, expire within 2 weeks and are 3-5 strikes out.

Hey WSB,

Not sure if this is WSB appropriate because it isn't YOLO material, but I thought I'd share anyways because people in the other trading subs liked it. Maybe some of you will eventually realize it's better to have money than not have money. I also like to share the good word and collect GitHub stars which I'm sure will be worth something some day.

S'anyway, I wanted to automate one strategy for my main buy and hold account, and after a lot of messing about with various brokers/APIs I settled on IBKR for a variety of reasons. I decided to release the work I did as an open source project (you can maybe tell from my GitHub profile that I've been building software for a while, and I make things open source when I can).

I wanted to solve these problems:

* automate trading as much as possible to remove emotional mistakes/issues
* work with broad market index funds, like SPY/QQQ/VTI/TLT/BND/whatever rather than individual stocks (I prefer not to mess with stocks unless I am o.k. with losing money)
* provide more consistent returns while clipping some of the short term gains (we do this through covered calls)
* taking advantage of the historical profitability of writing puts instead of buying the underlying (check out [this paper](https://cdn.cboe.com/resources/indices/documents/pap-assetconsultinggroup-cboe-feb2012.pdf))

This strategy is based on something called "The Wheel", which is useful when you a) want to own the underlying stock or ETF and 2) want to harvest from the volatility along the way. It's a somewhat passive strategy (compared to trying to guess uppies vs downies), which is my preferred way of investing.

I won't go into a ton of detail here on why this works (or rather: IF it works), but you can check out content on YouTube or wherever to learn about 30 delta covered calls, 30 delta BuyWrite indices, theta decay, so on. From that you draw your own conclusions, and decide whether it's the right risk/reward profile.

# Example Usage

You really need to read the project README to get a better sense of how to use it, but if you REALLY want to start quick you can run it with docker (you'll still need to create `thetagang.toml`, the config for the bot, and `config.ini` for IBC, samples of which can both be found in the project):

    $ docker run --rm -it \
         -v ~/ibc:/ibc \
         brndnmtthws/thetagang:latest \
         --config /ibc/thetagang.toml

\- Ho Ho Ho_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Sweet week _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ First post. more to come. _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ CRSR - WSB's Next Millionaire Maker Big play **CRSR -** Corsair Gaming should be looked at again for WSB's next big play. WSB was high on CRSR after earnings and hit a ATH high of $51.37 earlier last month and is currently trading 35% below its ATH. With the success WSB has had on bringing in retail investors and media recognition, CRSR could easily double from current levels. Let me break out why

**IPO and history:** CRSR ipo'ed back in August 21, 2020. Selling 14 million shares to investors/retail (This float will be important later on) at a price of $17. The stock traded mostly sideways until its first earning report where it blew out estimates on November 10th and rallied from $27 to $51 in a 14 day span.

**Revenue Growth:** CRSR has been growing revenues rapidly year over year, with 17% growth from 2018 (937M) to 2019 (1.1B). CRSR is on track for its best year yet with revenues YTD 9 months of 1.1B and Q4 earnings coming up expecting revenues in the $450m+ (low on guidance, I expected $600m+) range due to the Christmas sales bump/blackfriday/cyber moday. Representing 55% revenue growth from prior year and drastically exceeding its computer accessory peers. (LOGI 11% 2019 growth and 6.3% 2020 revenue growth) This factor alone should pay dues in its upcoming earnings  come February 2021.

**Valuation to competitors:**

LOGI: 15B market cap - 3B annual sales (6.3% annual growth) Price to sales: 5.06

CRSR: 3B market cap - 1.66B+ annual sales (51% annual growth) Price to sales 1.91 

(severely undervalued) PT of  $65 would still put this at under half of LOGI's Market Cap which would be reasonable considering CRSR's revenue growth rate.

**Inventory:** CRSR has expanded its production facilities over the past year and began to stock pile inventory for the upcoming increase in demand during holiday season (christmas, black friday, cyber monday). Inventory levels of 210m Sept 2020 vs 144M June 2020. All old inventory on the books went on fire sale and were on the top deals pages for slick deals/walmart/amazon. With prices slashed up to 50% off these items were quick to sell out and these sales will be reflected in the upcoming earnings call. Guidance was forecasted at 450M for upcoming quarter, which is on the safe side and inline with their Q3 earnings but I expect it to blow these estimates out of the water and coming in at the 600M+ range which would be inline with their quarterly sales growth excluding holiday sales bump (generally a 15% increase in sales from Q3.

**Margin Growth and turning a profit**: CRSR has been implementing economies of scale and recent revenue growth to begin to turn a profit. CRSR has gone net income in Dec 2019 of 6m to 36m as of September 2020.

**Balance sheet:** CRSR has a strong balance sheet with no red flags. Consistent increasing cash positions, Strong working capital, Increased inventory levels for the holiday season rush and minimal debt. The IPO raised238 million dollars from the proceeds and was directly applied toward their debt. Reducing it from 500m to 370m. Which should be paid off by the end of 2022. They are cashflow positive and will no longer need any cash injections/share offerings in the future.

**Recent Sell off:**

Taking profits: People who rode the stock up from earnings from $27 bucks to $51 taking profits and investing in other hot sectors EV/SPAC/IPOs. The dry up on volume has resulted in this stock heavily following the SPY.

Analyst Downgrade: Cowen & Co downgraded the stock with a price target of $37 causing it to drop 15% early last week, stating the risk is to high with its recent run up and is overvalued compared to LOGI. (see analysis above, on a price to sales where CRSR is currently trading at below 2 P/S compared to LOGI at above 5 P/S

&#x200B;

**FLOAT!!!!!!!:** The main reason this should be WSB's next play is its tiny float. Of the total 91.92m shares outstanding only 17.79M represent the public float which was offered during their IPO. The remainder of the float is still locked up until February 22,2021.

Of this 17.79m Float institutions own 14.47m (all purchased between October 19th to November 27th)

Some key holders include -

BlackRock: 2.16m shares

JP Morgan : 1.96m shares

Massachusetts financial : 1.55m shares

Citadel advisors : 1.9m shares

JPM small growth : 1.27m shares

FMR: 1.06m shares

The remaining public float is sitting at **3.32 million shares for a 3 billion dollar company**.  This stock can be manipulated and pumped by our autistic forces easily. Which is one of the reasons why this stock ran to $50 bucks on minimal volume. (this was before institutions loaded up, will be even easier to pump a second time around)

Floats previous pumps:

NIO: 177 Million

PLTR: 1060 Million

HCAC: 30 Million

CRSR: 3.3 Million (TO THE MOON)

**Short interest:** 1.6 million shares are currently shorted (50% of the active float), these shorts will have to call at the first sign of another run up, sending this to the moon.

**Bid/Ask spreads:** the daily spread on this stock is alone is anywhere from .7% to 1.2% which further proves how tight of a float we have here. Once we get our autists to slap the ask we will see this thing pump 15-20% days.

**TLDR: CRSR is generating record revenue growth and undervalued to its peers (LOGI), has a strong balance sheet and to kick it off has a public traded float of 3.3m which will send this stock flying the moment we get behind it. Calls are relatively cheap due to recent sell off and volume drying up. Best case we send this back to ATH's where it should be, worst case you have money invested in a undervalued company that will crush earnings come early February.**_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Pershing Square Holdings Ltd View on PSTH (Pershing Square Tontine Holdings) - World's Largest SPAC [ü§î](https://emojipedia.org/thinking-face/#:~:text=May%20be%20paired%20with%20%F0%9F%92%AD,to%20Emoji%201.0%20in%202015.)**Back to basics with Ackman's PSTH play**[ü§î](https://emojipedia.org/thinking-face/#:~:text=May%20be%20paired%20with%20%F0%9F%92%AD,to%20Emoji%201.0%20in%202015.)

It's always good to just go back to the basics. There are a lot of rumors floating regarding PSTH. Speculation without an LOI announced as of yet. Some moves seem much more likely than others ***but we are still in the dark.***

In August, PSCM CEO Bill Ackman wrote a letters to investors. In it he has a section dedicated to PSTH. You can find some of that below. I have bolded what I think are the most important parts highlighting the biggest clues. People like Ackman are careful with these letters, they are legacy, like with Buffet's letters.

***Pershing Square Tontine Holdings, Ltd. - Letter to Shareholders***

On July 22nd, Pershing Square Tontine Holdings, Ltd. (‚ÄúPSTH‚Äù) completed a $4 billion IPO on the New York Stock Exchange. We designed PSTH to be the most investor- and merger-friendly SPAC in the world. Apparently investors agreed, as we had more than $12 billion of demand for the offering when we stopped marketing the IPO on the second day of the road show. We capped the IPO at $4 billion, which, when added to the Pershing Square funds‚Äô minimum $1 billion commitment, created the largest blank check company in the world. 

We capped the size of the public offering so that we would not materially limit the potential universe of merger candidates in which our shareholders would, via a merger, become a minority owner of the newly public company. We are seeking to own a minority interest in the newly merged company because we believe our willingness to be a minority owner will differentiate PSTH from the substantial majority of other private equity and strategic buyers who require control, and are therefore prepared to pay a substantial control premium. 

**Sellers are much more price sensitive when selling 100% or even a controlling interest in their business for obvious reasons. A seller‚Äôs price sensitivity declines, however, when they are selling a smaller interest that allows them to achieve other important strategic objectives. We therefore expect that a potential PSTH merger partner will be much less price-sensitive in a transaction in which it, in effect, sells a minority interest in a merger with PSTH, which also allows it to raise $5 billion of equity capital and retain control of a newly public New York Stock Exchange listed company. In fact, the smaller the interest they are selling, the lesser the price sensitivity, which makes mergers with larger companies more likely to come on more advantaged terms than with smaller companies. PSTH‚Äôs targeting of companies that are multiples of its size is designed to enable it to acquire a minority interest in the newly merged company at an attractive valuation.** 

We have always believed that SPACs are interesting investment constructs. We have had an excellent experience and strong investment results from the first SPAC we co-sponsored in 2011 that merged with Burger King, the predecessor company to Restaurant Brands, which remains a core holding more than eight years after the merger. In principle, a properly structured SPAC with a strong sponsor should offer a much more attractive alternative to going public than through an initial public offering. This fact has begun to be appreciated more widely, including by members of the venture capital community. Recently, Bill Gurley, one of the world‚Äôs leading venture capitalists, wrote a detailed blog post comparing SPACs and direct listings with initial public offerings. Bill makes a powerful case for SPACs. We encourage you to read his post: https:// [abovethecrowd.com/2020/08/23/going-public-circa-2020-door-3-the-spac/](https://abovethecrowd.com/2020/08/23/going-public-circa-2020-door-3-the-spac/) 

In order to address these alignment issues, with PSTH we eliminated all forms of compensation, advisory fees, and founder shares. We further improved alignment issues by the Pershing Square funds committing to purchase a minimum of $1 billion of common stock and shareholder warrants on the same terms as PSTH‚Äôs public shareholders. In addition, the Pershing Square funds purchased so-called Sponsor Warrants for $65 million ‚Äì their estimated fair market value at the time of the IPO ‚Äì that will become 10-year warrants on 5.95% of the newly merged company shares, only if we successfully complete a transaction. 

We also negotiated and capped the underwriting fees payable at 1.8% of the SPAC‚Äôs minimum equity capital, further reducing frictional costs. We paid two-thirds of these fees with the purchase of the Sponsor Warrants, which reduces the total frictional costs of PSTH in a merger borne by shareholders and our merger partner to a *de minimis* amount. 

**We used the excess demand for the PSTH IPO to curate a shareholder list that would be the envy of any public company. We selected investors for their reputation as long-term, value-added owners. We expect our shareholder registry will contribute to PSTH‚Äôs appeal as a merger partner for a high-quality company.** 

We also made a number of changes to the typical shareholder warrant structure of SPACs that minimizes the risk of shareholder redemptions. These structural changes, when coupled with our large amount of committed capital to the entity and our curated long-term shareholder base, reduce and likely eliminate the need to raise expensive so-called PIPE capital at the time a transaction is identified, a de facto requirement in nearly every other SPAC transaction. 

**The result of all of the above is that we now control a publicly traded, NYSE-listed company with $5 billion of equity capital that is seeking to merge and take public a large capitalization private company that meets our investment criteria for business quality, growth, and an attractive valuation. PSTH is the largest SPAC in the world with the least amount of frictional costs in a merger, making it a highly attractive alternative to an IPO. As such, we expect that PSTH will give Pershing Square‚Äôs investors and PSTH‚Äôs public shareholders unique access to an untapped universe of bespoke, large-capitalization investment opportunities.** 

**To give you a better understanding of the unique, large scale of PSTH, there have been only three U.S. IPOs in the last decade of $5 billion or more ‚Äì Alibaba, Uber, and Facebook ‚Äì and the degree of difficulty for completing an IPO increases materially with its size.** This makes PSTH an extremely attractive alternative for a company that would like to raise $5 billion or more of capital and go public, particularly during a period in the capital markets which is likely to be highly volatile and uncertain because of the economic impact of the virus, the upcoming presidential election, and the challenging political, social, and economic environment. Uncertainty is the enemy of the IPO and the friend of a $5 billion SPAC with the largest amount of committed capital.

**We are in discussions with a number of potential companies that are owned and/or controlled by private equity firms, families, start-up company founders, as well as other private companies, and are encouraged by the initial interest that we have received.**

Did you fail to invest in Shopify? I did.

Let's not sulk - let's turn that negative into a positive. Let's bet big on companies that share aspects of pre-moon Shopify.

Upwork, ticker UPWK, is that company. These are the ways they are like Shopify or better:

* Upwork is a platform that helps people make money
* Upwork is the market leader in their industry, online freelancing
* Every person alive is a potential Upwork user. Upwork is onboarding ***10,000 freelancers per day***
* Upwork's Total Addressable Market Size is massive and global
* Upwork adoption will naturally scale with multiple ongoing global trends:
  * English language learning***
  * Global broadband deployment
  * Remote Work / Distributed Firms
  * Improved SaaS collaboration tools/workflows
  * Increasingly expensive salaried labor in rich countries 

A final comment on Upwork's Addressable Market:

Upwork's addressable market is misunderstood and underestimated. Management currently says the market opportunity is $500 Billion per year.

United States wages in 2018 totaled $8 Trillion. The US is 25% of world GDP implying that global wages are around $32 Trillion. Further, it is estimated that 40% of all jobs can be done remotely. $32T * 0.40 = $12.8T. This Global labor market is over 20x bigger than Upwork management realizes.

I have personally ramped spending on Upwork in my businesses and every entrepreneur I know is onboarding and ramping spending.

Positions: I own 7000 shares of Upwork and am buying more

ps: Cannot use amibroker because do not have a windows machine._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ NIO We saw NIO hit an all time high in the high 58s before coming crashing down to close at $41 today. What happened?

üåà üêª Andrew Left of Citron broke momentum by posting a price target of $25 for NIO. This was the first big event that caused NIO to plummet, although it did rebound, but many retail and boomer investors were scared off.

Then the House passed the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act. This bill delists foreign stocks that don‚Äôt uphold the standard American GAAP American accounting standard. This brought Chinese stocks and NIO under $50 for the first time in weeks. This is super irrational as NIO has been compliant ever since the Senate passed this bill months ago (they even use the same auditer that Tesla uses).

At this point, NIO is being way undervalued and the selloffs were caused by really irrational things and NIO should be a buy already.

All looked well and NIO was consolidating at $45-$47 before two days ago. Then NIO announced a $2B stock issuing (which only diluted shares by 5%) and everyone freaked out and paper handed till NIO sits at the $41 it is sitting at right now.

Well what will this $2B be used for. Rumor has it that NIO will be using it to expand in foreign markets soon and building infrastructure in Europe, etc. üò≥ if this turns out to be true this could be a huge catalyst for another NIO rally.
https://www.google.com/amp/s/cntechpost.com/2020/12/12/nio-is-closer-to-entering-overseas-markets/amp/

Other potential causes for a major NIO rally include NIO Day on 1/4 (think of Tesla Battery Day but chinese) üöÄ
And the fact that NIO is showing a pennant forming right now. Don‚Äôt want to link an Imgur, but trust me. It sold off a couple times and is consolidating rn, prime for a breakout. Breakout could happen by end of next week according to my calculations.

NIO is at a deep discount right now, levels we haven‚Äôt seen since early November so be prepared for a major moon soon

Positions:
110 NIO shares, 
$69 1/2021 NIO calls_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ An alternative hypothesis for PSTH + Stripe, for the betterment of the world Greetings fellow retards,

I would like to submit for your consideration the following hypothesis: **a spin-off of a Financial Crime Enforcement division from within Stripe as a publicly owned company through Bill Ackman's SPAC.**

After having my mind totally shattered the last few days by watching some of the most insane biopharma pumping and dumping upon the Actual Stupids that inhabit stocktwits.com go down in real time (and getting banned from the platform in the process), I decided to clear my head for a while and then have a good think about the forgotten jewel of my autistic eye, Pershing Square Tontine Holdings.

This hypothesis should be read as an optimist's case that could possibly tie together a number of disparate threads into a sort of unified field theory about the roles that a SPAC like PSTH specifically and an infrastructure behemoth like Stripe will have in building the economic future of the internet. If you feel like immediately dismissing this post because of [this exchange](https://imgur.com/azcdTT3) or because your brain don't work good for other reasons, please exit the üöÄ immediately.

To start with [Bill Ackman](https://imgur.com/a/wwofHhU), I mean, just look at the man. You would let this silver fox impregnate your wife if he showed up at the door because you are, like me, A F*gg0t Who Cares Too Much (or if you please, a üåàüêª). It'd probably make her happy and you'd get a kid way smarter than the wretched spawn you've loosed from your own loins out of the deal, too.

Anyway, for those who somehow still don't know this, Ackman is an activist investor and one of the more unconventional thinkers operating in the cesspool known as Wall Street. He's probably best known for two things: 1) his COVID crash short that was a [literal hundred bagger] (https://www.forbes.com/sites/antoinegara/2020/03/25/billionaire-bill-ackman-100-fold-return-on-coronavirus-hedge-2-billion/?sh=6f49d29e6fcc) and 2) a short position that blew up in his face to the tune of $1 billion, which he took against the very cool and very legal company that is definitely not a pyramid scheme, Herbalife. This dude is so autistic that he üíéüëê a [$300 million gain into a billion dollar loss trying to strangle the company.](https://imgur.com/GjAOQVp)

If you've been paying attention to Ackman's last few days on Twitter, [he's been busy putting the screws to the big credit card companies](https://imgur.com/ZHsjkAP), with some apparent [success](https://imgur.com/kOq2H8E), for servicing Pornhub, known destination for pedo creeps. As someone who has spent the last year and a half slowly losing sanity while learning as much as I can about one [Jeffrey Edward Epstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Epstein), a network of events and financial institutions that support this hypothesis starts to take shape here.

Famously, Epstein hung around a lot of people at the highest echelons of so-called "polite" society, appears to have been some kind of intelligence honeypot meant to blackmail sick rich fucks (look up the origins of the CIA if you want to know more about this), and [most definitely did not kill himself with the toilet paper thin sheets that they give you in the clink](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7855039/Graphic-photos-Jeffrey-Epsteins-autopsy-reveal-bloodied-neck.html) **(warning: dead guy pics within)**. He had close working relationships with [JP Morgan Chase](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/22/business/jeffrey-epstein-business-wall-street.html) and [Deutsche Bank](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/07/jeffrey-epstein-case-deutsche-bank-fined-150-million-penalty-for-relationship.html), which both have [conspicuously small positions](https://imgur.com/b4dOMkL) in PSTH, as well as [Goldman Sachs](https://www.wsj.com/articles/jeffrey-epstein-burrowed-into-the-lives-of-the-rich-and-made-a-fortune-11564092553), which is totally absent. I should probably note [that Ackman's wife did receive some Epstein bucks through the MIT Media Lab](https://www.artnews.com/art-news/news/neri-oxman-jeffrey-epstein-13236/) and that Ackman looks to have tried to [bury that story,](https://www.axios.com/joi-jeffrey-epstein-ties-mit-media-lab-professor-8384aa42-32d4-42dc-a0eb-54e23bcdee3a.html) which is ***very not cool***. Anyway, enough about Epstein (go listen to TrueAnon if you want to get yourself some of the same psychic damage that I have about him üëÅ). 

Bank ownership of PSTH seems weirdly low in general except for [Wells Fargo](https://imgur.com/I3mrEiM), which strikes me as odd when considering that the top known holder of PSTH is Guggenheim, which has been historically [jacked to the tits](https://imgur.com/gRaf649) with holdings from the finance sector, but trimmed those positions considerably after the financial crisis.

By this point you may be finding yourself asking "how the fuck does all this relate to Stripe, you schizoid freak?" to which my response is that the [banks themselves](https://www.icij.org/investigations/fincen-files/) are the biggest financial crime doers in the world and with institutions like [Deutsche and JP Morgan](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-09-21/highlights-from-the-fincen-files-on-banks-suspect-transactions) being particularly egregious offenders, Ackman could be using his big fucking brain to cook up the future of public accountability in finance.

Consider the recent toothlessness of the organizations theoretically in charge of maintaining compliance with financial laws. There are examples that directly are relevant to everyone here who uses Robinhood (which picked [fucking Goldman Sachs](https://www.reuters.com/article/robinhood-ipo/exclusive-trading-app-robinhood-hires-goldman-sachs-to-lead-ipo-sources-idUSL1N2IO2TN) to lead their IPO). This includes their failure to disclose their practice of [selling order flow](https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-free-trading-on-robinhood-isnt-really-free-1541772001), for which they were fined a [piddly $1.25 million by FINRA](https://www.finra.org/media-center/newsreleases/2019/finra-fines-robinhood-financial-llc-125-million-best-execution). Robinhood's [top buyer of order flow is a little company called Citadel,](https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1m2p1cv68bx56/Twitter-Freaked-Out-Over-Robinhood-Selling-Its-Trade-Flow-But-the-App-and-Others-Have-Been-Doing-It-for-Years) which was fined [a mere $700,000](https://imgur.com/0yT6vpJ) for using this data to snipe retail orders from retards like you and your cousin Billy using [high frequency trading algorithms](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/091615/world-high-frequency-algorithmic-trading.asp), which is called frontrunning and is ***extremely not cool and extremely not legal*** (but crime definitely pays). For a company whose literal mission statement is to ["democratize finance for all,"](https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/our-mission/) Robinhood sure does seem to put their finger on the scale in ways that unquestionably favor the big guys and by extension, themselves. By the way, the concept of selling order flow was invented by a dude you may have heard of who is currently serving a 150 year sentence for running a giant Ponzi scheme and will well-deservedly die in prison in the middle of Fucking Nowhere, [Bernard Madoff](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/paymentoforderflow.asp). Don't you wish the regulators would get off their knees, get the market maker dicks out of their mouths, and do their jobs?

Now we return to Stripe. If you've ever bought anything on the internet, you've probably used Stripe to process the payment, even if you didn't realize it at the time. Stripe could wind up being one of the biggest and most valuable companies in the world if they play their cards right, and big brain haver [Paul Graham thinks they could wind up being the next Google in terms of valuation.](https://imgur.com/am4ONjr) Stripe is thought to [be valued somewhere from $70-100 billion right now](https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/28/what-to-make-of-stripes-possible-100-billion-valuation/), and we know that Ackman has about $7 billion in his war chest. I'd wager it's likely that the recent spate of IPOs by dog shit companies like AirBnB and DoorDash giving them ~$80 billion and ~$55 billion market caps respectively pushes Stripe's valuation toward the higher end of those current valuation estimates. Even the NPCs at /r/stocks are starting to figure out that something's fishy with [IPOs.](https://old.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/kbbf2e/the_amount_of_insider_trading_with_ipos_is/) Also take note of the second tweet in that Paul Graham screenshot, because it strikes me as being not altogether dissimilar to what Ackman has previously said about what he thinks was his biggest miss going long, [Mastercard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxqTwpWizw4).

Stripe offers an [expansive and rapidly growing](https://imgur.com/OUSWYZi) anti-financial crimes platform called [Radar](https://stripe.com/radar) and is actively hiring for roles that seem like they'll be mission critical for the future of a company that's growing globally like [this one](https://stripe.com/jobs/listing/financial-crimes-investigation-payment-methods-lead-apac-chinese-speaker/2351914). They've already built the infrastructure that huge swathes of the internet economy run on and they're just getting rolling. 

Given the levels of utter incompetence bordering on malfeasance by the syphilitic boomers with worm-filled brains that supposedly regulate finance, is it so implausible that an avowed optimist and guy who definitely thinks about this stuff more than you, [Patrick Collison,](https://imgur.com/5zwzFPm) would team up with the man running the [most investor-friendly SPAC ever](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/22/ackman-pershing-square-taking-no-compensation-for-new-spac-investment-vehicle.html) to truly bring the fight for equality of financial opportunity to the free market?

This company is a biotech company that makes modified tobacco for cigarettes and cannabinoids in hemp or something.

Lets cut to the tendies.

Basically there is speculation that the company will receive MRTP status, which enables the company to be the only company to sell and market VLN cigarettes. (which have 95% less nicotine in their tobacco)

Not to mention the FDA just ordered 3.6 million of their spectrum cigarettes, Which the FDA is interested in because there is apparently a push to require cigarettes to contain minimal nicotine from this quote on their website.

" The Company‚Äôs research cigarettes will continue to fuel numerous independent, scientific studies to validate the enormous public health benefits identified by the FDA and others of implementing a national standard requiring all cigarettes to contain minimally or non-addictive levels of nicotine. "

the yearly revenue is already close to that of last year's and already more than the year before and will probably finish at a 30% revenue increase.

This was the beginning of a re-evaluation of üê≠ as a business. Its going to be the leader in streaming, along with its massive parks, ESPN, sports/gamblling, IP, toys, merchandise content business. Remember Netflix 222B and all it does is provide streaming. üê≠s streaming growth outpaces Netflix's by an order of magnitude. Remember üê≠ + was announced a fucking year ago. 1 year and they are projecting quarter BILLION subs by 2024.

Now smooth brains will say "oh they dont make any money streaming". Thats naive and shortsighted. They pull people into the üê≠ universe. üê≠famously makes a killing on gay shit for neckbeard like Star Wars action figures, comic books, t shirts, even stuff like cereal and happy meals and all this shit. Content and IP is priceless. Everyone from the day they were born to the day they die consume üê≠ content. They can then monetize their strong brands, until the end of time. When was Mickey Mouse created? and they are still selling Mickey Mouse merchandise like it was released yesterday. How much $$$ you think they will print on just Star Wars and Marvel merchandise/toys? More than you can afford, pal.

They fcuking make Star Wars CEREAL, for gods sake. Let that sink in. Netflix to date is STILL not making money. üê≠ has a clear path to profitability. They will be bleeding money out of their ass from their content/branding/liscencing deals until the end of time.

Huge gap up today on 87m volume. For reference the day before it had 8m volume. That means institutions are buying. And institutions dont buy to hold 1 day or 1 week or even 1 year, 175 is the new low. 200 is a magnet, and then beyond that

in time. They dominate streaming now, and this is before they roll out their new Star Wars, Marvel, etc content.I think in due time, their streaming business will be valued at more than Netflix (currently 222B for NFLIX). This is hardly a stretch. Mkt is future oriented. Look at how TSLA barely sells any cars but they are the most valuable automaker by far, because market knows they will dominate in the future.

Hard to not choose üê≠ as the early winner of the streaming war, even though it hasn't happened yet. But hard to compete with literally like a hundred years worth of original content which Netflix simply cant compete with. Yeah House of Cards and Stranger things is cool, but kids want to watch Lion King, Tarzan then grow into teens who wanna watch Iron Man and Captain America. Netflix cant compete, there's nothing they can do. America literally grows up on üê≠ .

Oh, and they make billions on parks (vaccine is here), they own ESPN, and even have a stake in Draft Kings.

This is a unique opportunity, because its now a high growth stock AND a blue chip. Their moat is maybe one of the strongest ever. Its fucking üê≠. Their are kids in Gyna, Africa who play Mickey Mouse and watch the lion king. The dominate the movie industry, own Fox which produces art house films to Marvel, to Star Wars to jungle book and everything in between.

Most of these meme stocks go up on pure hopium and no earnings. This a blue chip with extremely high growth.

I began this journey like many of you near March. I went in completely blind, naive, and uneducated, but was ready to learn, and get fucking *rich*. Well I am still all of those thing, but now broke. These last 9 months have been a crash course of trading trials, tribulations, and lessons.

**Mistakes: not locking profits, averaging down too often, FOMO, otm plays on weekly expirations (theta whassup)**

Many, many mistakes were made along the way... one of my favorites was not taking profits on a $15k  overnight gain, and not taking those profits. Lost just about it all that next day. I make $60k a year. Good times. 

*Greed* and the *what if mentality* was my killer. I could be up 300% on a trade thinking, *iT cOuLd Go hiGhEr* just to watch it dwindle to nothing. Then go red. Which would roll me into my second mistake of averaging down desperately into the abyss. 

At times I would be late to the party, catching a hot ticker after it's run and getting the mother bitch emotion of FOMO. Buying at the high, exchanging text message to my fellow retard friend who also bought at HOD and watching the ticker sell off, never revisiting those levels we bought at, as we exclaim *DiAm0nD hAnDs bAbyYyY...*  until they were near worthless.

I wanted to be a yolo man. A far-OTM-weekly-calls-on-a-Thursday-hoping-this-thing-starts-pumping-and-outweighs-getting-fucked-by-theta, man. But we all know how that story ends. 

&#x200B;

There were two reasons my naive ass made it this far to begin with;

1) There were a couple good friends that attempted to take me in under their wing, convince me to by closer to the money/further out expiration plays. Sometimes I would listen, make solid coin, see my account go up, then blow it reverting back to OTM weeklies.

2) I was relentlessly dumping paycheck after paycheck into my accounts. Don't do this. Take a step back. 

&#x200B;

Well, that's about all I have to say. If anyone would like to drop their best piece of advice I would appreciate you taking the time to do so. 

Learning is about fucking up, getting knocked down, getting up, and trying again. Continue to be resilient and never fucking quit, but be wise about your recklessness.

What does it mean to have good fundamentals? It means that in addition to this stock getting lumped into the meme category and generating ridiculously fat tendies in the near-term, there‚Äôs also a sense of comfort from the downside protection (a foreign concept to many of us) the fundamentals of the company provide. As you‚Äôll see below, at its current valuation, there is significant runway for APXT to go up on pure fundamentals that you can quantify and comfortably defend, and not purely on speculative hype that a lot of these other meme stocks seem to be propped up on.

Since a lot of other posts in this sub cover what the company does, I‚Äôll be brief. APXT is a SPAC to bring the company AvePoint public. AvePoint is a SaaS data management company that basically provides security offerings and solutions to ‚Äúplug holes‚Äù associated with data transfer within the Microsoft Office cloud solutions. In other words, they help migrate, manage, and protect data in Microsoft 365. You can definitely read more in other threads, I think they do a good job with the qualitative stuff. The main takeaway is that it‚Äôs a legit business that has many diversified blue-chip customers and operates in an industry with strong tailwinds. Now, onto the good stuff.

The hardest part of any investment is not determining whether a company is good or bad, it‚Äôs ‚Äúis it worth the price?‚Äù Once the qualitative checkboxes are checked off (e.g., this company isn‚Äôt committing fraud, it‚Äôs not losing to competition, isn‚Äôt levered to the tits with debt, etc.), which they are for APXT, investors typically look at a few metrics for these software businesses to determine the appropriate valuation. These are TAM (Total Addressable Market), growth, recurring revenue, profitability, and churn, among others.

**APXT TAM**: $33 billion (represents if all potential customers bought all available your products)

**APXT Revenue Growth**: 25% per year (30% on a recurring revenue basis)

**APXT Recurring Revenue**: \~78% of total revenue (2020); this represents subscription revenue that customers contractually pay year over year (e.g., spotify charges on a subscription based model while video games that you buy once are changed on a license/one-time revenue model)

**APXT Profitability**: 14% EBIT margin (% of revenue that is kept as profits before the impact of interest expense (which there are none) and taxes)

**APXT Churn**: N/A unfortunately

**APXT Balance Sheet**: Looks clean ‚Äì no debt, $252M of cash

Based on all these metrics, you get a pretty complete financial profile for the business that you can compare to other publicly traded peers to triangulate around an appropriate valuation. Here is a sample of other high growth SaaS companies:

https://preview.redd.it/lcz1w3bu8n461.png?width=853&format=png&auto=webp&s=cbd0d103fb750a4eaacc97323d108b31a2085466

As you can see, APXT fits into this comp set quite well in terms of growth, profitability, TAM, and recurring revenue, though it is somewhat smaller in terms of revenue. But what about price? The everyday analogous way to think about price or valuation is shopping for clothes (or anything, really). Of course a custom tailored Italian suit complemented with Gucci loafers is going to be a much doper outfit than an oversized white Old Navy t-shirt complemented with oversized jhorts you got from Goodwill, but it also is going to cost you 1000x as much. Same principle applies to company valuations. Unfortunately there are no price tags on stocks ‚Äì it‚Äôs a bit more complicated than just comparing straight up stock prices. You have to look at the stock price (x) the number of outstanding shares, which gets you the market cap, or the equity value. Then you have to add net debt (total debt minus cash). This resulting sum is called the company‚Äôs enterprise value (EV) and represents the worth of the entire company. For companies like these that have strong growth and no profits, the appropriate comparison to make is against each company‚Äôs EV divided by its Revenue. This represents the value of the entire company (based on the stock price) relative to its revenue, a fundamental metric. Companies with similar profiles in terms of growth, recurring revenue, etc. should have similar multiples. Going back to the previous clothing example, the suit + Gucci sleds are much better than the Big and Tall sloppy seconds, but once you normalize for the price (e.g., looking at the price divided by fundamental metric like quality of clothing), the relative advantage of the suit becomes much more muted. If the suit was just as cheap as the t-shirt and jhorts, then you‚Äôd obviously buy the former, because the price / fundamental metrics ratio is much lower. Same concept here with APXT. Let‚Äôs look at the same table above, except now with the EV / Revenue multiples

https://preview.redd.it/1zpgx0qx8n461.png?width=853&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e6419e322dbfdb5a90d71ce905c781761ed798c

As you can see, APXT has strong fundamental stats, and is relatively cheap (at 17.4x vs average of 20.8x), suggesting it is a good buy.

For those who say these companies aren‚Äôt comparable on the basis of size ‚Äì I completely hear you. All the comps listed here are bigger than APXT despite sharing otherwise similar characteristics. Okta and Ping both operate in security and the last 3 companies are direct companies APXT mentions in their investor presentation as having comparable profitability and growth above a certain size metric. For what it‚Äôs worth, I‚Äôve done separate analyses showing that size isn‚Äôt a strong predictor of valuation (it‚Äôs more so growth and other fundamental metrics).

To summarize, at $14.33 a share (closing price at 12/11/20), the company is worth \~$2.6B EV, representing a \~17.4x EV / Revenue multiple. For a SaaS company growing at 25% in a large market benefiting from strong tailwinds that has already achieved profitability, this multiple is somewhat conservative (read: low), and I can see it going much higher given the current market environment. Two years ago, I would never have dreamed of calling a company trading at 17x Revenue conservative, but times change and in the era of companies like DoorDash IPOing for absurd valuations (27x revenue), it‚Äôs certainly not unfathomable for a company like this to trade up to 25x, which translates to \~$19/share, representing a 33% upside from where it‚Äôs trading at today.
