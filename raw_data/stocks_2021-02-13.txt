Yesterday I was in a position where I was reaching into the Margin side of my account and I'm still not entirely sure what they are.  Basically I made a little mistake and bought Target for my taxable account when I meant it to go into my Roth Account, and because I didn't have enough cash, it started going into my Margin section.  I wanted to make a little money while still being able to sell the stock so I decided to do an option that would close the same day, and it was then when I found out about my Margins.

A few years (2018-2019) ago I dabbled with an app, but the things happened that confused me. I didn't put much money in ($50) but I felt if I list that then it wasn't for me and if I did well I would invest more. Some stuff happened I didn't quite understand which scared me off:

 1. I had stock in Bojangles (a fast food chain in the southeast) who were then bought. My stock was automatically bought when this happened. 

 2. Had stock in JNUG and shortly after they did a reverse split, again forcing me to cash out as I had too few shares to make one of the new ones once they combined them.

 3. I don't exactly remember the details of this one, but I had some fitbit stock, which then sold to google and I think I was automatically cashed out again.

If I had planned to hold on to the stock during a dip but was forced to still then I would go broke right? Are these types of things common? I feel I was lucky my stuff was bought when it was doing well as opposed to poorly...

I’ve tried asking on /r/PennyStocks but did not get an answer that helped me. 

I am new to trading and I stumbled on [$COCSF](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/cocsf) which seems to relate to [$KOF](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/KOF). After doing some naive research, I found that both of their profiles are identical (same company, same contact information) with the exception of the price and the fact that KOF is listed on NYSE while COCSF is listed on the OTC market.

Could someone explain to me, and show me how they did their DD on this to come to the conclusion regarding:

1.	the difference between these two tickers, besides the exchange they’re listed on and one being penny and the other not?
2.	is COCSF dead? Can a ticker be dead, and if so, how can you tell?
3.	hypothetically, if KOF is doing well/bad, can that impact COCSF? And vice versa

Consider the Canadian oil sands producers Legitimate free cash flow generation in the oil industry is really hard to find. While Canadian oil sands producers have meaningful downside exposure to low oil prices, oil sands are very well situated to provide sustainable free cash flow to investors when global oil prices exceed $45-$50/bbl.

In my years covering the oil industry on the debt side, I have found Canadian producers are often misunderstood by many non-Canadian investors that do not follow the industry too closely. Canadian oil sands production is more like a manufacturing process than it is traditional oil drilling. Once the initial capex has been invested in the plant infrastructure, it does not require much more maintenance capex to keep production steady and this supports free cash flow generation. This is why you see the Canadian oil producers paying dividends and unlike many other US E&P’s, they can actually afford to pay them from free cash flow when oil clears $45/bbl. Similar to US wells, the all-in production costs are higher than you will find in the middle east, but once you clear $50/bbl the operating leverage provides a lot of earnings upside.

Canadian oil sands producers have very different oil production methods than the US producers. Canadian oil sands use a mining or steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) process where they inject steam into oil deposits/bitumen below ground and pump up the heated, loose oil and water to the surface. The two keys are (1) oil sands have very low production decline rates a when compared to traditional wells and (2) the maintenance capex to keep production steady is very low. This supports strong and sustainable free cash flow generation based from very large proven reserves with long lives.

The US E&P’s experience very fast decline rates on wells they frack. All oil wells experience production decline as pressure drops in wells, but production decline is very high on the US wells. These wells in the Permian, Eagle Ford, Bakken, etc. are often described as “short cycle” since they are very productive in the first year but production rates fall dramatically afterward. Accordingly, the US E&P’s have to invest a lot of capex every year to keep production levels steady, or else risk meaningful reductions in production and earnings. This does not produce much free cash flow, if any, and has caused many of them to rely on debt financing to support their investing (sometimes leading to bankruptcy).

**Summary**: If you are a fundamental investor that pays close attention to free cash flow and dividends for valuations AND you are interested in gaining oil exposure with upside potential, the Canadian oil sands producers will be most appealing to you due to their lower maintenance capex requirements and sustainability of their production methods with long reserve lives.

In my opinion, the safer plays (high quality balance sheets and diversifying refining businesses) are Suncor (SU) and Imperial Oil (IMO), though upside is limited. Canadian Natural Resources (CNQ) is mostly a pure E&P with exposure to oil prices and still has investment grade debt ratings (Baa2/BBB-). I believe Cenovus (CVE) has more upside due to Husky acquisition, and it also (barely) has IG debt ratings (Baa3/BBB-) and also has refining assets.

**Disclaimer**: I own Cenovus Energy._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Is it pointless to hold identical etf/funds in different accounts?

I did a quick comparison between FB/MSFT/GOOG/APPL.

Obviously, these companies are not direct competitors but due to size and industry, they seem worthy for a little comparison.

&#x200B;

**P.E** \- FB: 26, GOOG: 35.14, MSFT:35.86, AAPL:36.72

**Revenue-growth 2020 -** FB: 22%, MSFT:14%, GOOG: 13%, APPL: 5.4%

**FB Average P.E for the last 6 months**: 29.5

&#x200B;

**Market Cap**: 770bn

**Equity:** 128bn (61 of which is liquid assets/cash)

It is clear that Facebook is still growing at a faster rate than other companies, but this does not seem to be priced in.

Even is it reaches a 6-month average price based on P.E you could see a quick 10% + return

That's not how to build wealth, that's how you maintain wealth. You should be looking for companies that can 20% this week, not this year. I'm not talking about penny stocks either, they're garbage and good way to gamble away your future. The quality of content when comparing Reddit to Twitter is embarrassing. It's the same tired companies getting everyone nowhere.

Edit: once you get closer to 100k you want to decrease volatility, but if you are under 50k you absolutely want to avoid large caps like the plague.

Edit 2: This is assuming you have a 401k *and* a personal portfolio.


When looking for companies you should rarely buy ones with oversized market caps. Its easier for a 750m company to 10x than a 150b company, and that's what we want right? 10 baggers. If you want to do that regularly you have to screen for companies with small caps, or at least smaller mid caps.


You want to buy up companies *before* they become profitable and ride the wave after they become profitable.


Look for accelerating revenue growth, and preferably <10 p/s.


Buffet says that diversification limits gains. That makes sense if you're investing in undervalued large cap stocks like he has historically done (which there are very, very few at this time). Investing in volatile high risk/high reward companies demands diversification.

iancassel_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Which stocks dropped the least last March? Looking to buy some defensive stocks. So far I'm looking at Proctor Gamble and Pfizer. This is just going to be a small percentage of my portfolio. I'm still holding stocks and ETFs and I will continue to buy calls._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Playing Devils Advocate: Why I'm already bearish on the THC market In the last week or two we've all seen a lot of unbridled optimism for the future of weed, THC, and CBD products.  For good reason too, it's a yet untapped market that could very well rival that of alcohol in the next decade or two with plenty of potential in the medical field as well.

&#x200B;

However, I don't think the money is going to flow how people are hoping it's going to flow.  I've made a few examples with some of the issues I foresee.

&#x200B;

1.  We have a great Canadian company showing strong growth and revenue.  First, lets assume that they decide there isn't too much more room for growth in Canada and they'll be better off selling to America.  First problem I see is that imports are going to be a nightmare.  Whatever the taxes and tariffs that are decided on are going to be heavily in favor of domestic production.  It's going to be at least a decade before America has much interest in exporting THC so the normal check and balance of retaliatory tariffs just wont be there.  The only way I see this not being the case is if there is some major player I'm unaware of who, for some reason, is unable to sell in Europe and decides to lobby against it.  They might as well start up a domestic production in America.
2. A "start up" in America who has lots of experience and a record of success in America (despite totally not having any since it would be against the law of course).  Finally things are really starting to look up!  Traditional loans are now an option, credit cards can be used, investors are beating down your door!  Only step you have to do now is get licensed!  No problem, you've been trough this before.  Only this time things are a bit different.  You resubmit all of the forms you completed before, but two are new, FDA approval and ATF approval.  The FDA approval is mercifully short, but you could tell it would be an absolute nightmare if you were trying to sell anything other than a joint; potential years of drug trials, QA certifications, licensing fees for specific strains, rigorous standards for ensuring THC and CBD content is as advertised, the list goes on and on.  Even the ATF form wasn't too bad, a few fees and such here and there.  Only one checkbox remains "have you or anyone in your company that you know of consumed, sold, or had business dealings with others involving marijuana prior to legalization".  It is clear that checking this box triggers and investigation, not checking it stops approval.
3. The Canadian company is 1. was lucky, the only Americans they knew before legalization were on hockey teams, so they can check this box without worry.  After a brief two month investigation, they are approved to begin growing.  They find some farmers that never grew marijuana before legalization (since most of the experience ones have been arrested or fined into bankruptcy) give them the tools and the training.  Only thing now are the seeds.  Before you can even ship them the farmer tells you "don't worry, we'll order them from Monplanto, I have a contract with them and am only allowed to plant their seeds."  After a while they find someone new who can plant the seeds you want, mercifully just before new regulations on seed imports are released.  Finally, all the hoops have been jumped and fees payed and through no small miracle, finally get your product to market.  There is a just one final obstacle to success, a punishing 30% tax.  Both the state and the feds now have a high tax, and you see your profit margins dwindle.  Thankfully they are still there, and you sell your pack of 5 joints for $80.  One more problem, there's a pack of 20 spliffs (have weed half tobacco) sold for $30.  You see, their product is being taxed at almost half the rate yours is since the tax is based on TCH/CBD concentration, and they are happy to sell at a loss.

&#x200B;

All three of the situations have something in common that I think we can count on.  The deck is heavily stacked against new companies.  We've already seen this happening to a lesser extent in states with partial legalization and when congress gets involved, I doubt that it will get better.  You might be asking "If there are no real current THC businesses, who would want to prevent new businesses from starting?".  Tobacco.  That's who.  

They all know they are in a slowly dying industry and need to get out.  What better way to get out than to give yourself a competitive advantage in a brand new industry that's basically identical to your current industry.  What I would do in their shoes is use my well established team of lobbyists to get the bar set so high that it costs at least 10 million just to play in the game while stacking the deck in my favor against those who can.  Then, use my connections to ensure that I am the first one on the field.  Once I'm there, I'm going to sell at a loss.  I'm already rolling in cash from big investors so 5 years of missed profits? not an issue.  Tobacco is still covering the losses.  Get the people used to the price and then the only competition is people selling "luxury" products.  Prices can be raised over time once the market is cornered for you and yours.

If I were to invest in weed, I wouldn't be looking at foreign companies or legally gray American ones.  I would be looking at the major players who have billions to gain and almost nothing to lose.  The ones with money.  My personal pick is  Altria Group (owner of Marlboro amongst others).  We know they are very interested in marijuana and are actually a proponent for legalization.  Rather curious, since it would most likely hurt sales in most of their subsidiaries.  They would only be there if they felt they had a lot to gain.

&#x200B;

TLDR:  I don't think anyone selling somewhat legal weed in America will survive federal regulation, I don't think anyone outside of the US will be able to sell to the US, I don't think any new company with a market cap under 1 billion will survive the first 5-10 years of being forced to sell at a loss to compete.

Disclaimer:  I'm a stranger on the internet, not a financial advisor.  I didn't even spell financial right on the first try.  This is not investment advice, it's a word of caution._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $SOS (SOS Limited) undervalued and may blow up in the near future SOS Ltd. is undervalued (imo) and unnoticed player in the crypto world. Its share price is now **$7.44** (actually \~$4 few days ago). I am writing this post because I think this stock has potential for a huge profit when comparing to stocks already grew up like **MARA ($38)** and **RIOT ($49)**. I am certain that $SOS can actually hit **$30** in the near future.

**TL;DR at the bottom**

Crypto is getting more and more attention when **Cathie Wood** and **Elon Musk** being bullish on it. **Tesla** bought about **1.5b** of BTC and is going to accept it as a payment method. BTC hit its ATH and helped MARA and RIOT explode. As BTC's price going up, it will also help **$SOS going up**.

When comparing $MARA or $RIOT to $SOS, you can find that $SOS has only gone up around 250% (actually only 100% few days ago) when $MARA, $RIOT going up over **1500%** and **1100%** respectively in the last three months. $SOS is just a train with **untapped potential**.

When comparing $MARA or $RIOT to $SOS then we can see that $SOS has been unnoticed so far and with those two companies going up over **1500% and 1100%** respectively in the last three months while SOS has only gone up around 200%. This is just **untapped potential**.

$SOS has a market cap of $484 million. Take a look at others like MARA and RIOT. MARA currently has a market cap of $3.6b and RIOT has a $3.3b market cap. With the catalysts I will mention below, I can see $SOS going at least **5x** this year from the current price. For the sake of being conservative, I will only give it a **price target of $30**. (Market cap \~$2b)

***About SOS Limited***

SOS is an emerging block-chain-based and big data-driven marketing and solution provider, with a nationwide membership base of approximately **20 million** in China. Recently, SOS has outlined its strategy in **block-chain and crypto**, which include a series of initiatives to expand its business into crypto mining as well as **crypto security and insurance**. The core infrastructure of SOS' marketing data, technology and solutions to insurance and emergency rescue services is built on big date, block-chain-based technology, cloud computing, AI, satellite, and 5G network, etc. We have created a SOS cloud emergency rescue service software as a service (SaaS) platform with three major product categories: basic cloud, cooperative cloud, and information. This system provides innovative marketing solutions to clients such as insurance companies, financial institutions, medical institutions, healthcare providers, auto manufacturers, security providers, senior living assistance providers, and other service providers in the emergency rescue services industry.

SOS Ltd. is a **first of its kind** in the crypto industry. SOS is the first **crypto insurance**, **crypto bank** and on top of that they're also **mining crypto**. They're mining BTC and ETH. Their goal is to be the first complete **crypto institution**.

Recently they just bought a **cloud computing company** which is capable enough to mine **3-4** **BTC daily and over 50 ETH**. Now with the rising value of crypto their revenue is only going to keep going up.

Announced on February 5th, SOS Ltd. entered a framework agreement with Leibodong Hydropower station in Heijang to secure **cheap and renewable electricity** for its cloud crypto mining center.

Adding on top of that, February 9th, they announced their receipt of **5000 pcs of Mining rigs** which arrived ahead on schedule. This rigs can generate about **BTC Hash Power 175P and** **ETH Hash Power 350G**. If these machine operates as expected, **the annual ROI (return on investment) is projected to be significant based on the current crypto price momentum**. The seller also confirmed that they have enough inventories of crypto mining rigs and that they can fulfill the next two batches of shipments as scheduled. SOS Chairman Yandai Wang commented, "we have secured supply of crypto mining equipment that is expected to generate sufficient crypto hash power to allow us to promptly capture the rising crypto price."

$SOS actually purchased **15645** Mining Rigs. They have another **10645** Mining Rigs on the way which will provide good news as catalysts in the future when they arrive. From my understanding, MARA only has near amount of mining rigs right now but is valued at 10x $SOS current price.

$SOS just announced a $110 million direct offering on 12 Feb. This sent the price down to **$5.48 (-13%)** before it promptly skyrocketed back up to close at **$7.44, up 18%** from the previous day despite the offering.

$SOS has announced intent to acquire FXK Tech Corporation("FXK"), a Canadian-based company, specializing in the block-chain technology consulting and operations and support for crypto exchanges and cloud crypto algorithmic power exchanges, to further extend SOS ecosystem of block-chain and crypto, **as well as to expand its operations to North America.**

***Financials***

SOS Ltd.'s balance sheet is just beautiful. Here we can see that they have a really good amount of cash in hand to improve and their debt is only \~$200k.

[Balance sheet source](https://stockanalysis.com/stocks/sos/statistics/)

Market cap is 484m with the share price of $7.44 as of market close 12.02.2021.

If we take a look at the performance of the stock we can see that it hasn't had its boom yet unlike $MARA and $RIOT who have gained over 1000% in the last few months. This gives me **more confidence** that there might be a **breakout** soon when more people find out about this company.

$SOS is projected to make more than **$277k USD/day** in revenue once all **15645** Mining Rigs are running. This is projected from the current crypto prices (Actually it's only $200k USD/day before tesla bought BTC, the price of BTC is going up). So you can understand the potential of $SOS.

***Technical indicators***

The technical indicators are also looking positive. We're seeing a **good volume increase** which usually indicates a breakout soon and it getting more traction. We recently just **broke the last resistance** ceiling as well and we are in a continuous **upwards trend** at the moment. Volume increase is also usually a **bullish indicator**.

**Summary/TL;DR**

SOS Ltd. is a stock which **has not boomed yet** (or just started to boom maybe) in this bull market. We still have chance to get on the train before it leave the station. SOS has a great balance sheet and positive technical indicators showing an **upwards trend** at the moment.

**SOS's revenue will increase** by each year as we can expect BTC and ETH to soar in the next few years, probably even few months as BTC just hit a new **ATH**. BTC has a lot more confidence now growing as well since the most well known and richest man on Earth, **Elon Musk**, just invested into BTC worth $1.5b.

With good performance this week, we can expect it to do better in the future.

Position: 1800 @ $5.5

Unfortunately for those reading this post but not yet holding $SOS, this post maybe a little bit late. $SOS announced an offering on Friday (yesterday), so it was the best time to buy the dip (although it actually close at up 18% finally). I bought in at $5.5 yesterday. I am 90% sure that $SOS will blow up next week and it may be hard to find an entry point. Its stock price somehow managed to go up with offering news......

I nearly had a heart attack, thinking that I had lost my account._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Am I missing something $AIV So I’m invested in a REIT called $AIV. I’m confused as to if I’m missing something . They split from another company in December causing the stock to go from around $50 to under $5. They’re a residential income company that invests in suburban areas. On paper they look good though they have 97% occupancy and 95% collection and it looks like the Dems are gonna push through a stimi with rental assistance and back rent. They’re P/E is under 3.5 and the lowest estimated fair value I’ve seen reading about them was around $39 a share. Is this a good find for a long term investment? I’m new to investing I used to say trade and then got reinspired  by a combination of listening to investment and money management youtube and audio books and WSB $GME $AMC gambit. I know people don’t give advise here but thoughts would be great and if your holding or have passed it up I’d love to hear opinions. Thanks for your time_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Found some articles dated back to the dot-com bust, and they are eerily similar  I was very interested in finding the rhetoric and overall feel of the dot com bubble so I searched by date before 2000 and here what I found.

"**Not long ago I asked the officer of a regional investment banking firm why the price-earnings ratio for a small publicly held company was so high. “After all,” I said, “this company has the potential to grow since it’s in the dental equipment industry. It seems to me it warrants a high ratio.” Don’t you know,” my friend replied, somewhat puzzled, “that that company is mainly a machine shop? That puts it into a low-growth industry classification.”** this is so eerily similar to tesla, not only does the guy say a p/e ratio is obsolete when it's not, but he also tries to make an argument that a dental shop is not a low growth industry when it is, very similar to how people say Tesla isn't a car company and price it differently because of that.

another interesting quote that I found was

**"It was once the job of analysts to tell investors at what price a stock should trade. But now, some analysts say investors are calling the shots, even when it comes to big stocks with predictable earnings growth. Sure, the fine art of rationalizing high stock prices has long been on display for tiny, unproven Internet ventures without earnings. After all, it's hard to value a new company using traditional methods when it has no earnings."** even after reading this I still could be fooled that this was written today, the way he says that traditional metrics don't matter or don't work anymore is strikingly similar, also the phrase "**But now, some analysts say investors are calling the shots"** is also ringing some bells in my head after this whole retail revolution.

and the final one I have is also the most striking

**"For day traders armed with Power E\*trade accounts and limitless optimism, the Internet is a revolution that has blown away all the old rules about how the stock market works."** this is just so striking to what I hear today, replace e-trade with Robin and boom I would say this was written right now. and also how they say all of the old rules are obsolete the next paragraph also very eerie "**For more seasoned investors, however, the Internet rally looks suspiciously like a beast they've seen rear its head time and again in an overripe bull market: a stock market bubble, fed by young, greedy investors for whom a 20% annual return on investments is a mark of defeat.".** this is almost an exact repeat of the dot com bubble, I never thought it was this similar but wow, I think I will begin to hedge my portfolio and I would caution against saying this times is different.

There was plenty of DD about CRSR leading up to earnings, everything I looked at showed amazing future potential for this company that is consistently showing it is making alot of money and doing the right things to keep the company growing. 

After the drop in price after earnings, the research I did showed that this is normal for a stock that had alot of movement before an ER. 

That said, what usually happens after it finds its support, or resistance level, it will start to climb back up. I think we are currently at this point of consolidation before a upturn. It has held around $42 for a few days now, and with money coming out of Weed stocks and possibly out of pump and dump selections, it only seems logical that money will start being put back into safer, profitable, future potential companies. 

This is why I like CRSR, I have seen reports saying it's new price point is $50+. I agree with that price, and think that is a very safe evaluation with the possibility of reaching $60 by end of year. 

This isn't a DD, if you want to read up on it, check around all the subs, plenty of great long detailed posts discussing their potential. I am just reminding people to not forget about it if you are looking for a safer investment after making money (or losing) on the recent pump and dumps. 


;TLDR - CRSR has plenty of future potential, looks like it's hit it's support level and should start to trend back upwards. Take a look for yourself at the many great DDs posted before earnings, and then at how well they did last few quarters. Very large upside potential here for the long term as a safer investment. 

Do your own DD, but I think it looks like a safe entry point with little downside._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ DD: $ZNGA- The reason you have a step mom r/stocks doesn't allow images to be embedded in posts, so I had to include images as imgur hyperlinks

Rest assured, I will be coming back and picking up shares and LEAPS. I would wait for a dip before getting in. Zynga has had a solid post-earnings runup and some investors may be looking to take profit soon.

Remember Farmville? The Facebook video game responsible for your parents divorce because your dad forgot to login and water mommy's corn and gourds? Words with friends, Farmville, Draw Something, and every app you ever downloaded on your first iPod Touch back in '09 was created by Zynga. These guys are the king of microtransactions, ad placement, and app downloads .

Zynga just reported earnings and shares jumped up 7% because the market liked what it saw. Zynga reported record revenue (+52% YoY), record users, record bookings (+61% YoY), record everything. This stock actually only goes up

**Why Zynga?/ MOAT**  
Zynga has been developing apps for over a decade. These guys have brand loyalty, they keep up with the trends and they know what gets downloads. I actually sat in an earnings call for the first time in my entire 3 day trading career and listened to what the company had to say about their future. Taken from the transcript here are some things that stood out to me:

**Brand loyalty**

• *One of Zynga's core competitive advantages is our ability to create forever franchises that are highly engaging and can predictably deliver sustainable growth over long periods of time.* *A great example of this is Words With Friends. In 2020, the franchise delivered its best-ever annual revenue and bookings performance in more than 11 years since its launch in 2009.*

**New titles**  
• *Coming up next from our new game pipeline, are Puzzle Combat and Farmville 3. Both titles have been progressing well in soft launch and are on track to release worldwide in the first half of 2021. We also expect our first Star Wars game to enter soft launch in early summer with the potential to release by the end of the year.*

**Top Downloads/ Expanding into Asia**

• *A key driver of this performance was our growth in Asia, where we continue to enhance our ability to self publish titles including Toon Blast, which was the most downloaded game in Japan on Android in 2020...* *Over the coming years, we see more opportunities to expand into international markets as we execute on our growth strategies*

• *And so far, in Q1, two of our new hyper-casual titles, High Heels and Blob Runner 3D have already reached the No. 1 and No. 2 top downloaded U.S. game positions on Android and iOS.*

• *With our acquisition of Rollic, we ended 2020 with three of the top 50 downloaded U.S. iPhone games.*

**Data and Analytics**

• *At the core of Zynga's live services platform is our first-party data network which captures key insights about how our players are interacting with our games. We use this data to deliver highly engaging interactive experiences for our players optimize our user acquisition and determine how best to monetize our games, including advertising.*

TLDR of that shit: Zynga has popular games, a loyal brand following, and an expansive machine for ad revenue. These guys advertise their other apps, in their own apps. Its like a virus, but one that makes you money

**Astrology:**

I eat crayons, I don't paint with them. But the highly educated people at TradingView seem to think the stars predict good time ahead. I trust them with my savings.

[TradingView for Zynga](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NASDAQ-ZNGA/)

**Risks:**

Any DD that is posted without a risk/deterrent section is just a masturbation tool for whoever posted. I encourage people in the comments to post questions/risks they might see. The biggest risks I see are either a broad market pull back like our perma-bear doomsayers are predicting. The collapse of the US dollar etc. Or just a slow down in growth due to the world opening up from covid eventually.

Get to the Oil Chopper!


DSSI stock

Amazing find. Edit: its not amazing find. Was told by cornwallance88 P/B ratio of 0.7 is not crazy discount, and other opec or places where us gets oil from need study. 

Edit not a good find.
Avoid this company DSSI, 
No strong evidence to suggest its undervalued.
Cornwallance88 has good points about the stock and industry. 

DSSI 

Diamond S Shipping Inc. provides seaborne transportation of crude oil, refined petroleum, and other products in the international shipping markets. The company operates in two segments, Crude Tankers and Product Carriers. As of June 30, 2020, it owned and operated a fleet of 64 vessels, including 13 Suezmax crude carriers, one Aframax crude carrier, and 50 medium-range product carriers. Diamond S Shipping Inc. was founded in 2018 and is based in Greenwich, Connecticut.

P/B ration is 0.7 wht this means is that the price of share is 30% undervalued. People if you sell the whole company, you get 30% gains per share.
Avg p/b value is 1.4 for the industry vs 0.7 of DSSI
             Disclaimer
I was told by cornwallace88 that 0.7 is not crazy discount. He said assets wont be sold at full value. 

Peoplee this company actually generates profit! No loss, PROFIT!


P/E ratio is 3 meaning the the cost of share is only three times worth the companys earning. The avg p/e ratio is 10.8


Price is share is around 8.57 but now its worth 8.85usd

Whats the catch? Why is this too good to be true? 

The catch is debt issue. :( The company has been using debt during its unprofitable year. The company is profitable now. And forcast to be profitable
The debt of the company is worth 70% of the company in assets. 

Knowing the debt issue, i tried to invest but the  price shot up. Someone is pumping it without it being on wsb, strange!!!
                  
Edit
Cornwallace88 said massive momentum in the market caused the jump in price. So its not a pump.

So the ETF account would hold:

1. SPY
2. ARKK
3. IWM
4. VGT
5. XLV
6. YOLO (this could be a shorter term investment)
7. VWO

The dividend account would have:

1. MMM
2. KO
3. IBM
4. JNJ
5. T or VZ
6. XOM
7. BKH
8. LEG
9. JPM or PBCT
10. HD

Thought process being ETF account would focus more on strong growth over the next 30 to 40 years and then put into something else when I "retire". The dividend account would be reinvested and focus on the income stream it produces in the future, making it a livable amount by the time i'd 60ish.

With both account, I would just buy more ever month or whatever, never worry about the short ups and downs. I'd save some cash incase we have major corrections I have more buying power.

Macerich is a REIT that specialize in shopping centers (you know, that thing that you don't go to anymore because of Amazon and the pandemic).

The company has performed very poorly company wise (occupancy dropped to 89.8% in 2020 from 95.4% in 2018) and in stock price (it dropped from $90 in July 2016 to $6 in April 2020 and is now at $12.90).

There are a few worrying things about this company. So let's go through them one by one and see how bad they are.

## Their debt

They've increased their debt (from 54.5% in 2018 to 66.4% in 2019 to a whopping 83.5% of their market cap in end 2020). Leverage like that on shopping centers (you know that thing you don't go to anymore because of amazon and the pandemic) could be ok : they don't really care about the declining revenue of those shopping centers, they just need them to pay their leases. But 2 things are pretty worrisome : i) some retail stores might go bankrupt and ii) Macerich is using $1.5bn of their line of credit.

To counteract that : The bankruptcy issue for retail stores is not that big of a deal for Macerich  and they have a (good) plan if they have to repurpose a shopping mall (both explained below). And for the line of credit thingy, their unencumbered assets (an asset or property that is free and clear of any encumbrances, such as creditor claims or liens) are sufficient enough to cover their $1.5bn in line of credit if it's needed. They can also dilute the shares to raise more capital. They've also filed for an ATM offering for up to $500 million.

## Occupancy / Rent collection 

Their occupancy is at 89.7	% (for the shopping centers that are not under development nor redevelopment). This is down from the 95.4% it was at in 2018 or the 94% in 2019.

The good news however is that "*rent collections, for example, during April and May were 35%, that grew to 80% in the third quarter. And as of today, the fourth quarter rent collections were at 92% and rising by the week.*" said Tom O'Hern, CEO of Macerich in their recent Earnings call.


## The declining trend of brick-and-mortar stores and shopping malls in general

That's a big one and this has been a much bigger trend as the pandemic forced some people to buy things online. This trend is also not new at all as [this Vox article shows very well](https://www.vox.com/recode/21561046/death-rebirth-department-stores-retail-charts).

But the silver lining is that as some retail stores are going bankrupt, the big shopping centers are getting stronger from having less competition. And since Macerich has mostly big shopping centers, that's pretty good for them.

## What about the bankrupt stores in the near future

Green Street Advisors expects "about a little more than half of all mall-based department stores to close by the end of 2021."

That can be a big problem but  they seem to be prepared for it. They're planning on doing some mixed-use development and I like it. Doug said in their most recent earnings call :

> However, we know our shoppers want more than just traditional retail. And that's why we continue to focus on bringing alternative uses to our campuses and not just retail. Uses like office, residential, hospitality, medical, wellness, education, fitness, grocery, service and even storage, and that's why we continue to refer to our properties as town centers because that's what they're becoming. They're transformational and will be something for everyone. And they have to be because that's what our modern-day shopper wants.

What makes me even more optimistic is that most of the estate they own is in California (25.8%) and New York (23.1%). Those are very high density locations which are the most promising places for redevelopment or for mixed-use purposes.

## The repurpose of their buildings 

That's great to know that they're *planning* on "bringing alternative uses to [their] campuses" but how faisible is it and how much will that help them?

First, let's see what Macerich could convert its buildings to :

- Offices but there's a lot of uncertainty in this area. We're in the middle of a big shift in this regard which might benefit them or not.
- Other retail stores but jesus christ this market is not doing good right now and has not been doing well years before the pandemic.
- Industrial complexes like warehouses are booming right now thanks to e-commerce and the pandemic. This looks really promising if they go down that road but they need to do this quickly and strategically as all locations are not necessarily interesting. 
- Housing which a lot of real estate have mixed feelings about.

Or Macerich could do another interesting thing : mixed-use development. 

> It is a type of urban development, urban planning and/or a zoning type that blends residential, commercial, cultural, institutional, or entertainment uses into one space, where those functions are to some degree physically and functionally integrated, and that provides pedestrian connections.

Most of the estate they own is in California (25.8%) and New York (23.1%). So let's evaluate their possibilities in those locations that they've invested in. 

**California**

Let's start with California and use [the Allen Matkins/UCLA Anderson 2021 winter forecast](https://www.allenmatkins.com/anderson-forecast/allen-matkins-ucla-anderson-forecast-california-cre-survey.html). They've polled a lot of real estate professionals in California and here are the results :

They're pretty pessimistic about offices ROI today but they're confident that demand will increase. HOWEVER, "*the panelists believe that newly built space, in addition to that freed by companies reducing their existing space, will outstrip any near-term increased demand for office space*". Outch! Right in the feels!

Ok so not offices how about retail spaces? That one is short : "*62% of panelists indicated that they will not develop any new properties in the coming 12 months*".

Also :

> Overall, the level of new retail property construction is expected to significantly decline from 2020 through 2023; and some existing space, lacking sufficient demand, will be converted to other uses.

However, for the industrial space market, they're really optimistic : "*approximately 30 percent of the panelists stated that the experience of the recession has caused them to consider increasing the amount of development they will undertake.*".

They're also expecting that the housing market will grow steadily when the economy rebounds.

So I'm pretty optimistic for California if they need to repurpose their buildings : they could turn those spaces into housing or warehouses/industrial complexes or in mixed-use schemes.

And how about Ney York??

**New York**

Well... The short-term outlook is not that pretty!

In end of July 2020, Metro Manhattan reports that [Office sales have dropped 58%](https://www.metro-manhattan.com/blog/report-new-york-city-office-sales-drop-58-during-lockdown/) and [retail sales activity dropped 78%](https://www.metro-manhattan.com/blog/report-retail-sales-activity-drops-78-during-nyc-lockdown/) during the lockdown.

[Also](https://therealdeal.com/2020/10/19/new-yorks-cre-woes-could-spread-nationwide-investors/) :

> Citing Trepp, the Journal reported that more than $3 billion worth of loans backing commercial property in the five boroughs are delinquent, and loans in creditor negotiations amount to an additional $4 billion.

Finally, a lot of people are leaving the city because i) it's the epicenter of the pandemic and ii) it's a very dense city that was attractive because most of the activity is there. Now that people can work from home, they're no longer trapped in the city and [110,00 people left during the lockdown as a result](https://www.mymove.com/moving/covid-19/coronavirus-moving-trends/).

So all of this hurts offices, housing market and retail stores (because less people means less sales) *in the short term*.

For the long term, long story short, that's going to be the same as California but they will need to repurpose a lot more buildings as the situation is much worse in New York.

**An the rest of the commercial real estate though?**

There's [a nice report](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/financial-services/commercial-real-estate-outlook.html) by Deloitte. The key messages summarize it well but I encourage you to read the whole thing as this is pretty interesting not only for Macerich but for all REIT investing in shopping centers in the US.

## Conclusion

Macerich is pretty undervalued right now with a maket cap close to $2bn. It's pretty understandable because of the situation it is in right now : their debt is pretty important and commercial real estate is in terrible state right now in general. But their finances getting better as of end 2020, their occupancy approaching 90%, their interesting plans for unoccupied stores and the promising long-term outlook in California and New York (the 2 locations they're mostly invested in) shows a very good upside while the downside seems to be already priced in._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Is there any browser extension that makes reading SEC filings easier on the eyes?

$KLIC

Due to the global microchip shortage, automation companies involved in the production of microchips are doing well, $KLIC (Kulicke and Soffa Industries, Inc) is one of them. In my opinion it's 🚀🚀🚀 (obligatory rockets for bullish sentiment)  for this stock.

There's a few reasons why I think this company is going to do very well in 2021:

* They are addressing a known bottleneck. PS5s and X-Box aren't being built fast enough due to supply chain issues: [https://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-biz-playstation-5-ps5-xbox-shortage-20201217-enxdgcnydvhbhm4p3uxdk6xetu-story.html](https://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-biz-playstation-5-ps5-xbox-shortage-20201217-enxdgcnydvhbhm4p3uxdk6xetu-story.html)
   * I'm a big believer in removing bottlenecks. I assume that all companies involved in the supply chain for consoles, computers, etc. are investing in expediting their processes (similar companies to $KLIC are also doing well and business has picked up in 2020 and 2021, you can search for competitors if you want, there are similar trends).
* Solid balance sheet and positive trends:
   * Book value of approximately $13.01 per share. This is about 807 MM. For additional context, their current market cap is at 2.7 billion [https://www.zacks.com/stock/chart/KLIC/fundamental/book-value](https://www.zacks.com/stock/chart/KLIC/fundamental/book-value)
   * Zero debt [https://www.zacks.com/stock/chart/KLIC/fundamental/total-long-term-debt-quarterly](https://www.zacks.com/stock/chart/KLIC/fundamental/total-long-term-debt-quarterly)
   * Solid recent growth. Most of their 1yr growth has occurred in the last 2-3 months. I suspect this is institutional diversification, but who knows.
   * This ticker is beginning to make some noise: [https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/klic](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/klic)
   * I think this company is less vulnerable to rug-pulls, I think there's enough value, momentum and global business need for what they are doing.

There are a few risks:

* Relatively unknown company. I found it when investigating other companies. I didn't pay much attention at first. I think there's many others like me.
* COVID demand will not last forever, at least not at the current levels; however, I think there's still months, perhaps years of built up demand. I don't expect we'll go back to normal any time soon or ever. More people will continue to work from home when comparing to years like 2018.
* This is not a sexy company. I don't really mind that, but let's be honest, that's not helping in attracting any eyeballs. This is the biggest risk IMHO in the current market.
* I'm sure there's other risks that I have not identified.

**This is not investment advice, you are responsible for your own decisions**. If you choose to invest in any stock, I'd recommend you to remember that no stock is worth all your money, invest for the long run and when you think you've made adequate profits and are ready for the next opportunity, move on.

* Also, I think I should have said this initially:
   * I don't think this is the next meme stock, I hope it isn't because I don't want to worry too much about exiting at the right time.
   * If I'm "too right" and this booms, I do not plan to post position updates because I don't want the burden of having people hold as long as I hold.
   * If I'm wrong and this tanks, I hope that not many of you shares in the losses. Only you can determine your exit strategy, please remember to have one!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ WOOF. I see value. Speaking of deep value, I'm finding it in WOOF after a deep dive. It's 1/8th the valuation of CHWY with very similar market shares (approx. 5-6%) and revenues ($4B-$5B range) as of the end of 2020. Chewy is definitely growing faster rn no doubt. However, the WOOF CEO started in 2018 and came from HPQ. He was definitely blindsided by the pandemic in orchestrating the turnaround. HPQ and its stock performed very well while he was el presidente, and it actually seems to have dropped quite a bit ever since he left. 

Long term debt is the elephant in the room, but the IPO will cover a portion of it (maybe 1/3), and a successful turnaround will take care of the rest. I like the omnichannel focus, the brick and mortar footprint (bc of in-store veterinary services) coming out of the pandemic, and a tech oriented CEO. If they can make big inroads with marketing and customer service (seems to be their biggest issues rn), they will be on equal footing with CHWY. Another small factor is that WOOF doesn't sell the trash pet food that CHWY does. Lots of other factors of course, but I like the stock and the opportunity for a turnaround. The $97B TAM means CHWY and WOOF combined only have like 10-12% of the marketshare, which leaves plenty of room for both CHWY and WOOF to thrive and not have to fight each other tooth and nail. 

Not as sexy as CHWY, but I think given CHWY's current valuation there is better risk/reward and upside for WOOF. Wish there were 2022/23 leaps available. Only goes out to September 2021 rn. Anyway, I'll be buying deep ITM September calls and a sizable shares position._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ 30 years old and just getting started. I started my 401k very late and luckily i work for a amazing company that has a great match program and stock purchase program. I was just letting my 401k do its own thing for a while until a older employee started talking about how much better he was doing doing the investing himself.

I opened up a brokerage account and just moved 2.5k over to dip my toes into the market.. and i have already doubled that in about two weeks. Complete luck...I have done some research but was wondering if you guys could give me some advice on ways to improve in the long term. Even very common advice will help because i am so new to this. Thanks!!


Edit : Thank you everyone for the awesome advice. 

Definitely will look into all of the material everyone recommended!

Edit 2 : Man,you guys are awesome. So much information to take in. Thank you all._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ What do you guys think of GE stock? Been seeing some promising news. I've been seeing General Electric popping up in the news quite a bit recently. There's some ideas they're playing around with that gives me hope that there will be a steady rise in stock value the way. Here's what I've gathered so far:

1. First off, right at the beginning of the year, an article came out on the New York Times about the massive wind turbine  Haliade-X  they've built in the Netherlands. This monster is the size of two 2 football fields and can power a small city. This is lead model for a series of more turbines in the works to come. Just look at this beast of a [windmill](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/01/business/GE-wind-turbine.html).
2. On that note, The Motley Fool put out this article yesterday announcing G&E's plan to set in motion construction of their  [V236-15.0 MW model](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/02/12/ges-rival-vestas-launches/) and they too seem to think it could look like a rise is on the way. Also, I don't know about you guys, but renewable energy is pretty dang cool to me. 
3. They have also announced some really exciting news for the automobile industry. Yes, flying cars are about to be real. "The [EV600 electric van](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/12/gm-unveils-ev-van-as-part-of-new-commercial-unit-fedex-first-customer.html) is scheduled to go on sale later this year through a new commercial business unit of GM’s called BrightDrop. The division is planning a full portfolio of electric products, not just vehicles, [including a delivery pallet that was unveiled Tuesda](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/12/gm-shares-hit-record-high-on-electric-van-and-flying-car-potential-plans.html)y" (CNBC). Now they look like inflated helicopters and I don't think it will be a revolutionary model, but it will certainly peak investor's attention. 
4. As of me writing this, [Larry Ramer](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/general-electrics-power-and-renewables-units-are-surging-2021-02-10) of *InvestoPlace* has held a long standing position in G&E. He notes their projects moving forward will be a crucial step to leading our goals to eliminate the use of coal in the U.S. by 2033. I am willing to bet this factor alone will mean a significant rise in G&E's stock within the upcoming 10 years. 
5. There's a decent amount of analysts recommending to [buy the stock right now.](https://money.cnn.com/quote/forecast/forecast.html?symb=ge)
6. Yesterday, they also announced a partnership with Intel to expand the use of renewable energy in Portland. *Environmental Energy Leader* reports  that "In 2020, PGE and Avangrid Renewables [announced](https://portlandgeneral.com/news/2020-02-11-portland-general-electric-and-avangrid-renewables-announce-major) the development of a 162-megawatt solar facility – the largest in Oregon – to meet the needs of [17 Green Future Impact subscribers](https://portlandgeneral.com/news/2019-08-21-sustainability-leaders-claim-pges-green-future-impact-in-record). That project is expected to come online in late 2021."

**Cons**

Here's a quick list of some things that do concern me about the companies outcome:

* Portland General Electric has a bit of notoriety when it comes to power outages. 
* General Electric [had to lay off many employees at the start of COVID-19](https://www.wsj.com/articles/ge-to-cut-aviation-workforce-as-coronavirus-grounds-airliners-11584972724), a factor that indicates the companies lack of preparation to crisis. Laying off masses of employees is also very bad PR and it seems to have played in important role to the companies drop in price when the pandemic hit. 
* There's also a LOT of outrage about their [25% cut of aviation](https://www.wsj.com/articles/ge-to-cut-aviation-workforce-as-coronavirus-grounds-airliners-11584972724) jobs back in May of 2020 for the same reasons explained above.

&#x200B;

Overall, I think the good news outweigh the bad ones for G&E. I think it looks really promising especially considering what they have been able to work on during this year. As of now, I only have 2 shares because I am out of a job, but I plan to go back to work soon and do look to buy more when my next paycheck comes in the mail. What are you guys' thoughts? Is there something I'm overlooking about the company or would you agree with me?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning February 15th, 2021 Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning February 15th, 2021.

# **Stimulus prospects could boost the stock market and interest rates in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/12/stimulus-prospects-could-boost-the-stock-market-and-interest-rates-in-the-week-ahead.html)**
*****
> The prospects of a big government spending program could continue to boost the stock market and put upward pressure on interest rates in the week ahead.
*****
> Earnings season is beginning to wind down, but some big names have yet to report.
*****
> Walmart’s earnings on Thursday should provide a good window into the consumer, as should the government’s retail sales report for January, also expected Wednesday.
*****
> The Federal Reserve on Wednesday afternoon releases minutes from its last meeting, and investors will dig into those for any insight into the central bank’s view on inflation.
*****
> # Two dominant themes amid stimulus prospects
> Inflation and rising interest rates have been two dominant themes for investors recently and have become increasingly so as the market has upgraded its view of how much fiscal coronavirus stimulus could be signed into law.
*****
> “The market is waiting to see how big the package is going to be. It’s going to be important. They can get it through reconciliation,” said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial.
*****
> Krosby said that Democrats could pass the stimulus under budget reconciliation, which means they could approve it with a simple majority instead of relying on negotiations with Republicans.
*****
> Some in the markets had anticipated a package of $1 trillion or less if there was a negotiated deal, but that now looks unlikely. Strategists have changed their view on the proposed $1.9 trillion package.
*****
> “There is less pushback to President Biden’s proposed stimulus from moderate Democrats than we expected, so a price tag of around $1.5 trillion seems likely, which is higher than we initially thought,” noted Cornerstone Macro policy analysts.
*****
> They say they expect a bill to come to the floor during the week of Feb. 22, and that it could become law by the first week of March. Investors will stay focused on its progress through Congress.
*****
> Market pros expect the bigger the spending package, the larger the pop will be in economic growth in the near term. That has helped send Treasury yields, which move opposite price, to higher levels.
*****
> It has also increased concerns about inflation.
*****
> # Inflation and rising yields
In the past week, the 10-year yield — a key benchmark — touched 1.2% for the first time since March. It reached that level briefly early in the week but returned to it in the final hour of trading Friday.
*****
> Yields are rising on optimism for an improving economy, but also as inflation expectations also move higher.
*****
> “If you think about the big drivers, they’re related - vaccines, stimulus and inflation,” said Michael Schumacher, head of rate strategy at Wells Fargo Securities. “If there’s more talk out of D.C. about moving the stimulus package forward, that sets the stage for yields to go up.”
*****
> The market is concerned about the economy running hotter, since it could be a trigger to change Fed policy.
*****
> At the same time, the Fed has said it would tolerate inflation above its 2% target.
*****
> Krosby of Prudential Financial said the market will also pay attention to the producer price index Wednesday even though it is not typically a big factor.
*****
> “Because there’s such a debate on inflationary trends, I know the CPI [consumer price index] came in comfortable, but the producer price index is coming in and we’ll see if that has eased,” she said.
*****
> “Obviously supply chains are being reestablished and inventories are building,” said Krosby.
*****
> Consumer inflation was running at an annual pace of 1.4% in January.
*****
> # Housing statistics
Housing data is also dominant on the calendar in the holiday-shortened week.
*****
> The National Association of Home Builders releases its housing market index data on Wednesday, a measurement of sentiment around market conditions for new home sales.
*****
> On Thursday, the government will issue data on pending home sales and building permits. Finally, the National Association of Realtors will release existing home sales data on Friday.
*****
> Upcoming hearing on GameStop and short squeezes
Stocks were higher in the past week, with energy, tech and financials as the best performers. The S&P 500 rose 1.2%, ending the week at 3,934.
*****
> There were some market hot spots, like cannabis shares which became the latest target of the Reddit trading community. The stocks shot higher Wednesday, adding to already lofty gains in recent weeks before giving up some of those gains.
*****
> Investors will also be focused on the Thursday hearing before the House Financial Services Committee on the wild trading recently in GameStop and other heavily-shorted names.
*****
> Robinhood’s CEO is expected to testify, as are executives from Melvin Capital Management and Citadel.
*****
> The frenzied activity in some small and shorted stocks has raised concerns about the market becoming overheated. But Ari Wald, head of technical analysis at Oppenheimer, said the broader market’s advance is intact.
*****
> “Overall, it’s a bull market. I think the steadiness of the advance is underappreciated,” Wald said. He said the market technicals are healthy. Breadth is broad-based and there’s cyclical leadership.
*****
> “The low-volatility, high-dividend paying sectors are at risk,” said Wald. Utilities and consumer staples stocks, which both fit that category, were lower on the week.
*****
> The market was also awaiting the outcome of the Senate impeachment trial of President Donald Trump, and it is not expected to react.

> # Presidents' Day Seasonality

> The US equity market will be closed on Monday in observance of the Presidents' Day holiday. Since 1971 when the Uniform Monday Holiday Act set the third Monday in February, rather than on George Washington's birthday (February 22nd) as the Federal holiday, equity market performance during the week of Presidents' Day has been pretty mixed. From the Friday before President's Day through the Friday after, the S&P 500 has traded higher half the time for an average decline of 5 bps. Taking a closer look, in the chart below we show the median returns by day for each trading day in Presidents' week. Tuesday and Thursday have both averaged declines of 13 bps and 7 bps, respectively. Wednesday averages flat performance but the S&P 500 has only been higher 40% of the time. Despite weakness throughout most of the week, equities have tended to catch a bid by week's end with an average 6 bps gain on Friday with a move higher 58% of the time.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021221-Presidents-Day3f.png))**

> In the charts below, we show the average intraday performance of the S&P 500 during Presidents' Day week since 1983 when our intraday data begins. We also include looks for years when the S&P 500 was up and down YTD headed into the holiday. Again, the general pattern has been a steady drift lower until Friday when the S&P 500 has tended to rebound. We would note that the Friday rebound is not an all-day event. As shown, performance is pretty flat in the first several hours of trading with the biggest ramp higher occurring in the final of hours of tradings. That pattern is also consistent for both up and down years, though, in years that the S&P 500 was down YTD headed into the holiday there was a bit of a rebound midweek which was reversed by the end of the week.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/902779bf6e4c3920c0a6e594303d1963/f9c2be89a4714ce6-96/s500x750/313ae18652b5c66a140a47602ee5649c59baeee7.jpg))**

> In a recent post we looked at the improving trend of market performance ahead of Presidents’ Day weekend. However, the two days after still display a fair amount of red. Since 1990, Tuesday after Presidents’ Day has been strongest for the S&P 500 with 18 gains and 13 losses for median gain of 0.12% but with an average loss of –0.23%. DJIA also has more gains than losses on the Tuesday after, but NASDAQ is a net loser down 18 of 31 years with and average loss of –0.49% and a median loss of –0.11%.

> Wednesday is all red for all three major averages. NASDAQ and S&P 500 have more losses, but DJIA has a larger average loss. On the Wednesday after the Presidents’ Day holiday DJIA is down 16 of 31 with an average loss of –0.07% and a median decline of –0.10%. S&P 500 is down 18 of 31, average –0.02%, median –0.10% and NASDAQ is down 17 of 31, average –0.01%, median –0.09%.

> # Why Bulls Will Like The Year Of The Ox

> “Bulls make money, bears make money, and pigs get slaughtered.” Old Wall Street saying.

> The Chinese New Year (often called the Lunar New Year) will kick off Friday, February 12, and with it will begin the Year of the Ox. Although we would never suggest investing based on the zodiac signs—it is important to note that the Year of the Ox has historically been quite strong for equities. Not to mention we are saying goodbye to the year of the Rat. Good riddance to the Rat, as the last two years of the Rat were 2008 and 2020, not the best years for many reasons!

> Since the Chinese New Year typically starts between late-January and mid-February, we looked at the 12-month return of the S&P 500 Index starting at the end of January dating back to 1950. And wouldn’t you know it? The Year of the Ox has been up more than 13% on average (with a median advance of nearly 18%); suggesting bulls are smiling indeed!

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2.10.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

> “The year of the Ox is the second of the 12 animal signs of the Chinese zodiac, and the Ox is considered a symbol of diligence, persistence, and honesty. Equity returns indeed are quite persistent during the Ox, as it is the third best return out of the 12 Zodiac signs,” explained LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.

> The LPL Chart of the Day shows how all the 12 Zodiac signs have done historically, with the Goat, Tiger, and Ox as the best, while the Rooster and Snake have been the worst.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2.10.21-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**

> We want to stress that no one should invest purely based on the zodiac signs. This relationship is random and the sample size is small. Still, here’s hoping that the Year of the Ox plays out well for the bulls once again!

> # Short Interest Update

> Yesterday, bi-weekly short interest data was released for the period ending January 30th. In the chart below, we show the Russell 3000 broken up into deciles based on short interest as a percent of the float at the end of 2020 and these decile's stock's median change in short interest from then to yesterday's release. As shown, with the short squeeze episode playing out in the second half of January, the stocks that came into 2020 the most heavily shorted have seen the biggest declines in short interest. That decile of what had been the most heavily shorted names has seen short interest as a percent of float fall for a median of 2.65 percentage points. Deciles two and three have similarly seen sizable declines, though, they are far smaller than those of the most shorted stocks. On the other hand, the decile of the least shorted stocks is the only one that has seen the median short interest reading move higher since the end of 2020.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021020-SI-Deciles-F.png))**

> In the table below, we show the stocks that currently have the highest short interest as a percent of float. After the historic move higher, short squeeze poster child GameStop (GME) is no longer the Russell 3000's most heavily shorted name! Having dropped over 100 percentage points since the start of the year, only 42.61% of shares are now short compared to 43.57% for Gogo (GOGO); currently the most shorted stock in the index. GOGO has actually seen its shorts come off a bit this year as well but that decline has been far more modest of only a little more than one percentage point. Of the other stocks in the index, only Tanger Outlets (SKT) and Dillard's (DDS) also currently have more than 40% of the float sold short.

> On the January 27th closing high, GME was up 1,744.53% year to date. But with the short squeeze unwinding, the stock has fallen over 86%. Others of this cohort have similarly seen big reversals of their earlier surges. For example, National Beverage (FIZZ) had doubled YTD at the time of the GME peak, but since then it has been cut by 33.78%. Not all of these have been losers since the pinnacle of short selling though. Fulgent Genetics, have similarly seen big gains of over 30%.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021020-SI-Table-Current-High.png))**

> Given GME came into the year with an absurd number of shares sold short, the squeeze has resulted in it being the biggest decliner in terms of short interest of any Russell 3000 stock. Short interest as a percentage of float has fallen over 100 percentage points YTD. The next biggest drop came from BigCommerce Holdings (BIGC) and Dillard's (DDS) which both saw larger than 50 percentage point drops. Of the rest of the top twenty biggest decliners, a baker's dozen have seen short interest drop by at least 20 points. Additionally, of these stocks that have seen short interest fall the most, only three—nCino (NCNO), Berkeley Lights (BLI), and 3D Systems (DDD)—now have a single-digit short interest as a percent of float.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021020-SI-Table-Decline.png))**

> Given the massive short squeezes, there are far more stocks that now have a lower short interest as a percent of float than at the start of the year. In fact, of the Russell 3000 stocks, 1887 have seen declines in short interest compared to only 1146 that have seen an increase. In the table below, we show the twenty stocks to have seen the biggest increases in SIPF since the start of the year. As shown, there is only one, International Game Technology (IGT), that has seen short interest rise by double digits since the end of 2020.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021020-SI-Table-Increase.png))**

> Retailers notably dominate the list of stocks with the biggest declines in short interest. To quantify this, in the chart below we show the aggregate number of shorted shares as a percent of total float for each industry group as of the most recent short interest data and the end of 2020. As shown, just as it was at the start of the year, retailers remain the most heavily shorted industry group, but it has greatly improved with only 5.86% short compared to 8.15% at the end of 2020. That is the only industry group to have seen short interest drop by a full percentage point or more. The industry group to have experienced the next largest decline was Transportation with aggregate short interest falling from 5.08% to 4.13%. Conversely, there are two industries, Banks and Materials, that have higher short interest as a percent of float than they did at the end of 2020.

# DISCUSS!

What are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?

*****

I hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great week ahead r/stocks._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Reading up on SEC forms; Question about 13G more specifically. I see a lot of them. (I know what it is.) But is it useful?

For example, you can look into the mutual fund/individual investing and check their track record. I tried this on one stock and saw that one of the companies the mutual fund invested a few years back declined. Is something like this at all a good indicator (the fund's track record) for an investment? Or do people usually not bother with this?

I haven't even begun to really look into fundamental/technical analysis of earnings so if you have any other advice on what forms are more useful that'd be cool. (Obviously earnings are useful but I'm having trouble researching if any of the other forms are practical to investors.)_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ VOO VS SWPPX So I have never invested in a index fund before. The way my custodial account at Schwab is set up I can’t just put an X amount every week into it I have to buy whole shares.  I’ve been looking at Schwab and Vanguards SP500 index. I don’t really know what to look in a SP500 so advice or prior knowledge on which one is better or what I should look for would be very beneficial and helpful for me._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ DD: Cloudflare (NET) is going to continue its strong outperformance. Buy the dip Alright guys. This is going to be long, but if you want actual DD, sit back and enjoy. NET is doing excellent, and will only continue to excel as it continues to grab market share and boom in the background.

&#x200B;

**---**

**What is Cloudflare?**

Cloudflare is going to make a leading player in next-generation computing. From their blog: [https://blog.cloudflare.com/rendering-react-on-the-edge-with-flareact-and-cloudflare-workers/](https://blog.cloudflare.com/rendering-react-on-the-edge-with-flareact-and-cloudflare-workers/). Excerpt:

>“Imagine you’re the maintainer of a high-traffic media website, and your DNS is already hosted on Cloudflare.  
>  
>Page speed is critical. You need to get content to your audience as quickly as possible on every device. You also need to render ads in a speedy way to maintain a good user experience and make money to support your journalism...  you’re going to need to pay for some beefy servers to be able to handle spikes in traffic and respond to requests in a timely manner...Cloudflare Workers allow you to run your code on the edge quickly, efficiently and at scale. Instead of paying for a server to host your code, you can host it directly inside the datacenter”

Seriously, this is cool, and it’s only beginning. Cloudflare is innovating every day. Their customers absolutely love them. As a software engineer, they have already have some products are there that are pretty cool like Cloudflare Pages and Cloudflare Workers. I think what’s going to help them into a powerhouse is this:

&#x200B;

>Over the coming months, we’ll be working on integrating Workers and Pages into a seamless experience. It’ll work the exact same way Pages does: just write your code, git push, and we’ll deploy it for you. The only difference is, it won’t just be your frontend, it’ll be your backend, too. And just to be clear: this is not just for stateless functions. With Workers KV and Durable Objects, we see a huge opportunity to really enable any web application to be built on this platform.

Soon, developers will be able to make full-stack applications end-to-end using Cloudflare’s network. Cloudflare will handle all of the annoying stuff about development including hosting and deployment. And they’ll allow developers of all size to instantly scale their application across the entire United States, all while increasing developer productivity and satisfaction.

If you’re not a developer, you probably didn’t understand most of that, but essentially, they’re making it so you can build entire applications using solely their infrastructure. This is actually genuinely cool, and will save the average developer tons of time and money.

I can easily see how this propels their growth even faster than 50%. And if this thing inches up to 60-65% YoY as it expands it’s profitability... 🚀🚀🚀

(And even if it doesn’t, and stays at 50%, it will still 🚀 but slower. Regardless, it’s going up)

&#x200B;

\---

“BuT iT tAnKeD oN EaRnInGs”

That drop is an absolute blessing to those who aren’t long. Plus it’s hardly a tank when it’s at ATHs if you exclude the one week in its history where it was higher

Its earnings was good, and to those who haven’t read it, [do so](https://www.cloudflare.com/press-releases/2021/cloudflare-announces-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-year-2020-financial-results/) besides relying on a stock’s immediate reaction. To the 90% who will completely ignore that sentence:

>Revenue growth was 50% YOY which is consistent with the last 3 earnings

&#x200B;

Revenue right now is $125 million **per quarter**  or $431 million for 2020. Doesn’t sound like much at first, but those of us know the power of compound interest knows how fast that number will be pumped. 5 years from now, that’s $1 billion a a quarter or 4 million a year. In 8 it will be $3 billion/quarter or 12 billion a year

Yes, 5-8 years is a long time. This is a buy and hold stock. That’s why I’m long Jan 21 115c.

The revenue and growth isn’t the impressive part. The margins are

>GAAP gross profit was $96.9 million, or 76.9% gross margin, compared to $65.7 million, or 78.3%, in the fourth quarter of 2019.

High 70s margins is absolutely incredible. And it's consistent quarter to quarter. That means once NET does reach profitability, they’re going to be **raking** in dough

That being said, NET isn’t profitable yet, which is pretty much the only argument bears can muster (that and high valuation but more on that later). Keep in mind they’ve been screeching the same thing since 2019 and that hasn’t stopped it. But once profitability is out of the way, there’s nothing stopping it from being a $300 stock. Here’s why:

\- Like I mentioned earlier, their losses are decreasing and if my hypothesis is correct, they will reach profitability by early ‘22

\- Currently 15% of the internet goes through Cloudflare’s network and that number is increasing. Literally, 1/6th of the entire internet infrastructure is worth $25 billion. In comparison, a bike company (PTON) is worth double that.

\- Boomer companies who need to replace their shitty infrastructure will likely turn to Cloudflare due to their reliable secure networks with guaranteed security. Not to mention their prices are dirt-cheap compared to their competitors.

&#x200B;

—-

**CONS**

The only cons are people concerned with profitability (covered already) and evaluation (priced at 60x sales which tbf is absolutely outrageous). However I think this is still short-sighted. As long as the bull market remains intact (big IF, but I’m a bull so as long interest rates are 0), there’s no reason to believe the rocket rally will end. As we see with SHOP and TSLA, traditional valuations don’t matter if the product has a dream, vision, and story, which with Cloudflare’s “Build a Better Internet” shtick, I think it does. Especially because customers actually like their product and Cloudflare will continue to innovate and build upon Cloudflare’s already enormous Cloudflare network.

This stock already got [multiple](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/cloudflare-drops-despite-multiple-price-target-upgrades) analysts upgrades. The drop was a blessing to those who aren’t in. Start investing in quality and innovation; $85/share is a whole lot less than $300 which is where they will be by 2025 (I want to say 2022, but I’m trying to be conservative here).

Seriously, give this a second look. I’ve been playing NET since 37. It’s a shit stock that consolidates for months, then rockets 30% in a week. Earnings being great (and not excellent) is the only reason NET hasn’t done its 30% move. I’m completely assured that it will soon

&#x200B;

EDIT: Made a huge mistake in the first iteration. I implied Cloudflare makes only 130 million a year. They made that last quarter. Their 2020 revenue was almost half a billion ($431 million)_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Let's talk about (very) long Oil plays. I was watching some Bloomberg at 5am because I couldnt sleep and noticed that Oil really took off this last day or so, probably in line with the S&P.

Anyway, I got looking at pretty much most of the big oil companies, BP, Shell etc and they are all hovering around 50% of where they were 12 months ago. My understanding is that this is down to the pandemic.

Other small oil companies are down about 20-40% of where they were 12 months ago. 

OPEC are meeting next month and are likely to maintain production output at its current level, according to the Iraqi Oil Minister a few days ago, possibly into April before they reassess it.

I'm just looking at Oil as a very long term play... 

Surely in 12-18 (maybe 24) months time, you'd expect at least a 20 or 30% recovery when the Pandemic starts to subside.

I appreciate all the sentiment about Green Energy at the moment, but we need to accept that we're not all going to be driving Tesla and Nio vehicles anytime before 2025. Its another 9 years (minimum) before petrol cars are banned in most Euro countries. 

Airlines, cruise ships, big industry... It's all going to pick up one day and they all need the black gold to function. I see demand increasing, dollar per barrel increasing, thus stonks go up.

is there any reason I shouldnt be investing very long in oil? And are there any oil tickers anyone could recommend aside from the obvious bp, shell, chevron, exxon etc._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ EFT overlap of entire portfolio or more than 2 at a time? Are there any tools out there that check overlap of efts more than 2 at a time? I know there is an eft comparison to for two edits.Or that analyze an entire portfolio.

Or even a tool that lets me input all efts and stocks and then checks it for overlaps? I don’t know if this exists but any help is appreciated. Thanks!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Buying based on Pivot Point. How important is that and does it really matter? Hi All, hope you all are having a good weekend.. 
I have a very basic question to ask and it's mainly to see if I should make this part of my buying strategy even though I'm usually holding a position for a few days.

Do you always open a position and buy on a pivot point? How much important is it to use as a buying strategy?

Looking forward to see views from you guys. Thanks_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ SBE extends voting for ChargePoint merger? Are institutional holders preventing the acquisition? I have only recently learned of SBE and plan on taking a position with them before they merge with ChargePoint, but I am trying to understand why the shareholders are slow to vote, or purposely not voting on the acquisition. 

I noticed that the 73% of SBE stock is held by institutions. Could it be that these institutions are purposely thwarting the acquisition by refusing to vote?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Strategy for selling/rebuying I'm 42 and I started investing about 6 months ago. Better late than never eh? My goal was long term growth, either for retirement or if ever I needed some additional funds. I have a mixed portfolio of single stocks and etf funds.  My portfolio is up about 2k, and I think it's important to note I've never sold anything.

This leads me to my question. A bunch of my stocks have had great and low results, obviously. I'm torn between taking the risk of selling some for profits and then hopefully waiting for a dip to rebuy. That seems like a perfect scenario, but I know it's a gamble. Is it a good gamble tho? Im not a day trader by any means but I monitor daily.

Maybe it's better to just keep buying/investing and not take that risk? I'm just looking to see if there's a general consensus on this strategy. Shrug. Ty

Edit: prob should note, this investing I'm doing is additional. I already have 3 retirement funds from in my 20's._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Aggressive investing / trading I’m young (19). I have no debt to pay for at least 4 years. After that I will likely have a decent paid job and I will be stuck in the eat, sleep, work, pay tax, pay debt cycle. 
I’ve saved up 10k. At the moment I’ve put 2k in apple, 1k in index etfs, 1.5k in ARK, 1k in NIO. 0.5k in PLTR.  I plan to keep on investing any more money that comes in. That leaves me 4k (which I’m willing to risk for high returns)
I’m looking to grow this as much as possible within 4 years to reduce my student debt. Now yes, I know time in the market beats timing the market. But the stock market has become a hobby of mine. I look forward to the market opening every day - whether it’s up or down. I’m always looking for opportunities. 
As of now, the majority of my money is invested in relatively safe equities. With the rest I really want to 2/3x my money. Being in the UK, I can do spreads - massive potential for gains and losses. I was thinking of doing spreads but in a swing trade kind of time frame. I would go big, but only on a decent dip on a well structured, stable stock (keeping a safe margin of course). I have made my fair share of mistakes with spreads, ranging from taking oversized bets on meme stocks, to cutting my losses early on stable stocks only for them to rocket to all time highs instantly after. 

Im just a little unsure on deciding between spreads or swing trading by buying actual shares. Spreads allows me to choose my potential gains and losses based on my risk. I would only have to deposit a fraction of the actual underlying stock price. It’s also tax free (though that doesn’t affect me right now).

I think my English is not allowing me to explain myself properly here but I hope you will see what I'm going for._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ TFFP has a potential game changing technology for drug delivery This is not investment advice.  Just me, in between watching South Park reruns, offering an overview of a company you may wish to check out.  Do your own due diligence.  Do your own homework boys and girls.   

Full disclosure:   I own a bunch of shares. 

TFFP (Thin Film Pharmaceuticals) has a special proprietary process for making just about any substance into tiny dry powder particles.    Many drugs are not solvent, have low  bioavailability, and the thin film matrix powder is much more readily absorbed by the human body.  Or, so the scientists say in peer reviewed published journals.   Lots of lab and some clinical studies published.   Data looks great.   

Why is this important?   
1).  There are many drugs that have awful side effects, adverse effects, that could be delivered much more safely with TFF delivery.  A smaller dose delivered directly to the lungs offers potentially way less adverse effects.  No stomach, kidney, liver absorption, for example.   
2).  There are many drugs that are super powerful in the lab but not so effective in the human body due to low absorption. Niclosamide is one example.  Powerful anti-viral but not easily absorbed.   TFF delivery could make this drug way more useful.  It’s an approved off patent drug so wide open to explore TFF delivery, eh.  Opportunity?   I think so.   
   Other drugs they are exploring include Tacrolimus and Voriconazole.   Either of these can seemingly be very well enhanced by TFF delivery.   The company has clinical trials underway and hopes doe approval doe both of those by early 2024.  Seems far away ?  Biotech stocks usually rise in anticipation and as clinical trials progress.  Usually.  Who knows.   It’s a stock.  Anything can happen.  🤞
3).  In addition to their internal drug development they have many big pharmaceutical companies evaluating TFF delivery to enhance existing or future products.    Exciting.   License dollars abs royalties could be big big, if successful.  Who knows.  I’m hopeful. 
4).  They have one cannabis customer / partner announced but not yet launched. Theoretically TFF delivery for cannabis will be much safer than vaping.  Abs maybe better than edibles or smoking.   Even a small market share in this huge market would be game changing for tiny TFFP.   
4). They have research work underway with the US Army to innovate in the field dry powder therapeutics to protect troops.  Very prestigious group called USAMRIID game them the research contract    
5).  They are working with a university consortium to explore TFF delivery for a universal influenza vaccine.   Exciting.  
6).   The TFF dry powder is very stable.  No cold chain logistics.  This is a key cost saving abs headache saving for nearly any vaccine.  But recent the covid vaccine Cole chain logistics problems have been in the news.  Opportunity???  Time will tell.  

Do your own work.  The company has presentations on their website abs many news releases.   Do your own due diligence.

At current times, where the market is so crazy and unpredictable, I find myself in a pretty bizarre situation. A bit of a backstory- I'm 18 y/o, and at the end of 2020 I decided I should hop on the investing train (better early than never). since I don't have any real financial obligations and am not in any debt, I decided to play it a bit speculative. Now, I know this is not something I should get used to, but I've already made 70% + in profit; thanks to NIU (@29), APHA (@4.7), and SPCE (@19). I know this is almost purely luck, but not sure how to change my strategy to being safer (since the market is, clearly, way too high) yet, not going completely Buffet kind of safe (since I'm still young, and fuck it, I want some action).

First of all this isn't a product, this is just something I built yesterday.

I built a stock tracker/portfolio tracker which notifies me via email about a predefined list of stocks. It can notify based and price targets (upper/lower) percent changes in different directions and general volatility, volume will come later.

There are global limits but a different limit could be set for each stock.

There's also portfolio tracking, I'll get a summary of my portfolio 30 minutes after market open, an hour before close and at close.


The emails have stock charts to display the price graph and some text.


The way I use it is that if I'm doing research And I see an interesting company I'll add it to my list and set the lower limit as the price I wish to buy at, waiting for a dip (and never missing it because I was alerted)

Oh, it must be free, by the way lol. Thanks for the help!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Trying to Understand how the Semiconductor shortage will impact Applied Materials (AMAT) I am currently looking at investment plays to take advantage of the semiconductor shortage occurring right now in the US.

What I know:
The real issue here is the lack of US located foundries as most semiconductor companies outsource this process to China and other cheaper countries overseas.

What I'm Trying to Figure Out:
I know Applied Materials designs and sells semiconductors, but I'm not sure of their foundry situation.

My Current Thoughts:
I feel like due to the supply and demand of the current semiconductor situation means that prices for semiconductors should be going up due to this supply shrinkage. As AMAT (known as a one-stop-shop for a vast variety of semiconductor product types) sells such a diversified product line, I feel like they have protection from the choke in supply but will benefit from the rising chip prices.

Since I'm obviously not incredibly knowledgable in this industry, I am taking the above assumptions as true to fuel my trading thesis below:
I believe that AMAT (trading at $117.90 as of writing this) will have a great week this week, and then an even more successful 3 months.

1 Week Outlook: As AMAT plans to post Q4 earnings on Feb 18th, the company will post healthy earnings as the world continues to work from home, school from home, and the semiconductor shortage grows further boosting prices of chips. The outlook could include speculation about receiving government funding for the aid and research into improving supply chain chokepoints in semiconductor production. I believe the week of 2/16 - 2/19 will see an increase of about 10-15% due to continuing upward momentum of semiconductor stocks and impressive earnings.
My suggested play is to buy 2/19 $120c at open on Tuesday. If the stock opens at what it's currently trading at after hours, these calls would price at about $2.10 each. If the stock price were to increase by 10%, (ending 2/19 at $129.69), these calls would be worth $9.69 each - a 361.4% increase in a week.

3 Month Outlook: Due to a continuing effort to improve chip production volumes and improve relationships with overseas foundries, AMAT as an industry leader will continue its supremacy over other semiconductor companies and have more sway over government funding programs. Increased funding, high semiconductor prices and massive and constantly growing demand volume will combine to continue to pull AMAT upward. If AMAT were to receive some of the government funding expected to be included in the executive orders assumed to be signed by Biden in the coming 3 (or so) weeks, AMAT will get an artificial bump, along with increased exposure and a subsequent boost to the stock price.
My suggested play is to buy shares on margin to increase leverage on a longterm hold with no time expiration.

What I think I'm wrong about:
I know the shortage is mainly appearing in the auto industry. AMAT produces semiconductors for the auto industry, but they also provide so many other types of products that diversify their exposure. This may also mean that any positive effects from rising chip prices may be diluted by being such a small part of the revenue makeup of the company. I think I may also be wrong about assuming AMAT can even benefit from a semiconductor shortage as they may get caught in the strangling of foundry contracting. I also know the government funding is mainly going to be for funding US located foundries which may not even affect AMAT as I do not believe they operate any foundries at all.

Please let me know your thoughts and help me better understand the situation. I almost made a couple trades today on this thesis but figured I should get a better understanding before risking money in a strategy that wasn't fully vetted or understood.

They cut 50% of workforce in 2020 to focus on profitability and transitioned from strictly growing to more of a direct retail presence which has much higher margins and lower revenue.

Anywho....

March 12th 2020 I took a position on RRGB. I live down the road from one and thought, once this pandemic is over people are going to want to sit down for a burger and fries and go to a place where their kids can enjoy bottomless fries while mom and dad throw back a drink and relive a night in America that starts with a burger and ends with a milkshake. Something.... Very American. 

I did not however, expect for RRGB to go from the $6.75 entry I jumped in at to the almost $30 it's touching right now. 

I am not an expert. I took a position based on how I would feel at the end of this. But now I don't know what to do. My instinct tells me that people are going to want to really get out to the movies, restaurants, get on a plane, etc. To me that sounds like the recovery may take RRGB to a higher place than at was precovid because of the pent up want of getting out.

But I have this other side of me that says, don't be stupid.... Sell.

Thanks for your time and input!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ High growth blue-chip stock for your portfolio： Paypal Previously, I've made my case for Fiverr, a company for freelancers, only last week. Since my recommendation, the stock has grown from 270 to 320 as time of writing. That's an \~20% increase. I believe the future of work will also be 'online' as opposed to traditional 'in office'. The last year, the coronavirus has only accelerated the shift to online-work.

I now propose another stock, PayPal. What's my reasoning for this? When you look at growth stocks, you also look at their suppliers. For Tesla, for example, you look at who's supplying the batteries for electric cars and can bet on that as well. The rise of Tesla and electric cars has created a halo effect, and the rise in their stocks for all of the industry.

Now, when you think of Fiverr, and the rise of companies based on online work, payment processing companies will benefit. When you transact with freelancers half way across the world, we are looking at payment processing companies that serve as a method of payment for your transaction. The likes of Visa, Mastercard, and Paypal stand to benefit. Why specifically PayPal?

Basically not only will PayPal stand to benefit from increased transactions as outlined above, Paypal also looking to get into anything related to digital payments. To quote, PayPal has jumped into the mobile payments space with Venmo, which is now the most widely used mobile peer-to-peer payments app out there. PayPal has also delved into cryptocurrencies, and now accepts cryptos on its payment platform. What’s more, the payments company is also jumping into more direct shopping and stock trading.

Basically, it’s doing it all. PayPal is turning into an all-in-one digital wallet for consumers. They are looking at doubling it's user-base and hence revenues. It's parallel is Alibaba's Ant Financial. It's massive in China, and before the Chinese government clamped down on the IPO, it was looking to the biggest IPO in all history.

So you would take 48500-4000=8500 difference right? 

And to calculate the percentage change would be 8500/40000×100=21.25%? 

Now onto the title. 

Now say I was only buying a fraction of a share. I would take the percentage change and multiply it by my dollar amount I put in and then add that to my amount

So sat I bought 3000 of the 40000 and it changed the 21.25 , it'd be 3000 x. 2125= 637?  So I'd be up 637?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ With some ETNs, I see "Exp 15 Feb 2038". What does it mean? I know that ETFs are not ETNs, but they are basically known a bit as ETFs.

On many ETNS, they have this weird thing on the right. I searched up what "Exp" meant, but it showed a different one (eXp if you're wondering). I can only infer that "Exp" means expiry/expiration, due to the context of it being next to a date.

I'm relatively new to investing, though I've been trying to learn off and on. The learning curve is steep and I'm definitely struggling. My question is: how do you know when a stock is at its ceiling and you should sell, or if there's still room to go up?

I ask because I've been sitting on 3 (lol) shares of SHOP since 2018. I bought them for $144 and they are now at about 1400 each. I never expected to see that level of gain and honestly when I bought them it was a ton of money for me to invest. But I used Shopify and they were expanding and weed was being legalized in Canada and the articles on them were all bullish so it seemed like as good a pick as any at the time.

My intent was just to keep holding them indefinitely. If they increased this much in three years then how much would I have in five, right? I realized today continual increase is not necessarily a given, and $1400 is actually quite a lot for a single share to be valued at. (I think?)

So, hence my question. How do I figure out if there's potential for the stock to continue to grow, or if I should take my gains and reinvest? DDs are far beyond my level as are a lot of things that go into them, so I appreciate any pointers on where to look and how to understand! Thank you very much._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Should I have a recurring investment in VTI or VXUS? I try to put 10 dollars a week into stocks, and I was wondering for the long term, would it make more sense to invest in VTI or VXUS? VTI is about 200 per share and has a dividend yield of 1.38 yet VXUS is 60 with a dividend of over $2. Is there something I’m missing?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ If "Everybody's a genius in a bull market," and bull markets last an average of about 3.8 years, shouldn't we be smooth sailing for a bit? I recently read that bull markets can be characterized in a variety of ways, but based on several commonly used merits, the most recent bull market lasted (a record) 11 years (from '08 until March of last year). The ensuing, relatively short-lived bear market was just around a month long before returning to bull.

So, if the adage, "Everybody's a genius in a bull market," rings true, would it be reasonable to expect my recent "success" in the stock market to be extended for a few more years before seeing a critical hit on my portfolio?

I'm usually the type to buy an ETF and just hold it forever but want to start some more active trading. 

When you buy a stock and sell it a week later for a loss or profit, you owe short term capital gains on it. Are capital gains all added up at the end of the year on a 1099 and the broker tracks which ones were short term and which were long? 

I feel like that makes the most sense. Also, which platforms do you recommend for active trading? I'm currently at Schwab so that may be good enough. They have comission free trades.

Also, if you have any recommended youtubers or sources I could check out that would be awesome. Thx bros and ladies._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ How was the 2008 crash for you? People who were trading during the 2008 crash, how did it go down?

How fast did everything happen? Did you manage to sell before you lost too much? Did you make much after it started to go up again?

Everyone seems to think we're in a bubble now so I'm preparing for the worst._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ What metric should I use if I wanna see the pre-split value of a stock? For example I wanna compare the price of $TSLA who's gone multiple splits now currently @ around 820 and $AMZN at around 3200 that never split. If $TSLA didn't split, it should be around 4000.

I believe there will be an increase YoY in revenue and EPS, but of course they will still not be profitable. However this news with $AT&T being a customer could really show that this company is legit- which I’ve already believe since the day I researched them.

I’ve loaded up and will hold through earnings as I will be for at least another year.

I see "reporting period" and "file date" when looking at these holdings, does anyone know if the reporting period or file date is when the particular institution actually purchased the shares? Thanks._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Virgin Galactic ($SPCE) pushed back phase 2 test https://twitter.com/virgingalactic/status/1360193157745491973?s=19

Didn't see this although it was announced earlier today. It explains the dip that occurred today for Virgin Galactic which is surprising as I didn't realize why it wouldn't have gone up a lot a day before their test flight but now it makes sense since there will be no test flight tomorrow.

This is nice in that it will allow people more time to decide what they want to do before the flight, but also really sucks for those who held through yesterday's 60+ gains when it could've been amazing time to sell high and buy back in on a dip._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_
