 Can you help me understand a prospectus item? I think this is a pretty general question re: ETFs or even just funds, although I happen to be looking at ARKG (Vanguard ETF similar):
The “returns bef taxes” is ~35% (1 yr)
The “return after taxes on distribution” is, say, 34.5% or an expected but small impact.
BUT, next line is:

Return After Taxes on Distributions and Sale of Fund Shares: 20.86% !!!!


And, again, Vanguard shows a similar drastic decrease! 
The huge decrease makes a S&P 500 index fund look like a better investment at something like 31.5%, but that seems unlikely.


So, what gives? Where did the “sale of fund shares” money go? Is it just bookkeeping & we prospective fund holders are getting the returns some other way??

* The market basically closed the year at ATH (3pts off) and is within a hair of 3855, which is the 138.2% Fib of the March low.
* The rising monthly channel (shown above) shows that markets are stretched near resistance and already outside of their bollinger bands. The weekly band is at 3774.
* While I believe there is room for upside into 2021, the risk/reward is **NOT** favorable here anymore. Sentiment is stretched and a correction would be welcomed with open arms.
* I anticipate a 10-15% correction to start the year, which would align us with the rising 200dma near 3219. We ended the year in a tight range, and there is potential to carry into 3855 based on January 15 open interest and gamma positioning.

Last few days I have been selling stocks and calls aggressively in anticipation of a correction. I am long TLT calls (flat) and SPY puts (down 37%).

**Sentiment:**

* The AAII Sentiment Survey is quite elevated near multi-year highs and shows overly bullish sentiment.
* The Advisors Sentiment Report reports the views of over 120 independent investment newsletters (those not affiliated with brokerage houses or mutual funds) and reports the findings as the percentage of advisors that are bullish, those bearish and those that expect a correction. The current Bull to Bear spread is one of the highest in decades, yet another indication of frothy sentiment.
* The NAAIM Exposure Index is currently at 89 and off some 100+ prints but remains elevated to the averages.
* The BAML Fund Manager Survey shows the three most crowded trades are:  

   * Long Tech via shares
   * Short USD
   * Long Bitcoin Spot via Perpetual Swaps
   * Fund managers are "all-in" on leverage. This is evidenced by our DIX print on Thursday yet again showing dark pool buying.
* Consumer Confidence deteriorated sharply in December, as the resurgence of COVID-19 "remains a drag on confidence.”
* CEO Confidence, as tracked by the Bloomberg Consumer Comfort Index hit a two week low at 47. This is the sharpest drop in economic outlook since April.

**Market Health:**

* NYSE Cumulative Adv/Dec:  

   * Actually pretty healthy right now. This is still well above all of its important moving averages and remains in an uptrend.
* NYSE McClellan Oscillator:  

   * Neutral currently.
* NYSE Summation Index (NYSI):  

   * Most commonly used by fund managers to find divergences. Above a short term 5/8 day exponential moving average is a buy signal. Below flashes a short term sell signal. This is *currently showing a sell signal.* However, sell signals in rallies tend to be early signals...
* Moving Averages:  

   * The 8/21-week EMA crossover has long been a favorite signal for momentum in individual names and also works with Indices. The 21-week EMA is important support for growth/momentum stocks. In general, you want to be long when the 8 week is above the 21 week and short when it is below with crossovers being key trend inflection signals. The 12-month moving average (MA) and monthly MACD are good longer-term risk management tools. The price action relative to the 200-week MA provides a good gauge for the health of the S&P 500’s secular trend. Pullbacks or corrections (aka cyclical bear markets) for the S&P 500 that hold above or near the rising 200-week MA are a secular bull market pattern. Pullbacks that decisively break the 200-week MA are a sign of a secular bear market. Most corrections on the S&P 500 during the 1950-1966 and 1980-2000 secular bull market held between the 100-week MA and the 200-week MA. The 2015-2016 S&P 500 pullback fit this secular bull market correction pattern. The secular bear market periods from 1929-1950, 1966-1980, and 2000-2013 saw sustained periods below these long-term moving averages. This means that the 200-week MA provides a good secular bull market risk management tool or stop loss. Using this history as a guide suggests that the Ichimoku monthly cloud is a good trailing secular bull market stop loss. History also suggests that a decisive move below the monthly cloud confirms a secular bear market for US equities. *Currently we are above all moving averages and this is a bullish signal.*

**Economics:**

* The common theme appears to be an expectation of a synchronized global growth in 2021.
* The optimism on 2021 delivering a record year for corporate profit growth and strong GDP growth around the globe is very contingent on a successful vaccine rollout. The current surge of cases and hospitalizations in the US and Europe is resulting in further restrictions and lockdowns that will weigh on growth expectations, or at least push out pent-up demand. Consumers have led the recovery so far with a boost from fiscal stimulus but the key to a self-sustained recovery is a strong capex cycle which is seen kicking off in Q2 2021. The labor market will also be in focus after record low unemployment the pandemic saw the number jump to 14.7% in April, the highest since the Great Depression, but has recovered rapidly though losing some momentum as it finished the year near 6.5% unemployment and consensus expectations to reach 5% by the end of 2021, still far-off from the 3.5% pre-crisis rate.
* The recovery has already started in 2H20 in the US & China while the European recovery has been more subdued. The driver of the strong 2021 recovery will be the full reopening of economies worldwide which makes a successful vaccine distribution critical. The US Dollar is closing 2020 weak and looks to have some structural issues with surging deficits, Fed’s intention to boost inflation, easy financial conditions, and expected economic and political improvements. The combination of easy monetary policy, a rebound in old economy industries and a global upswing in growth provides a healthy backdrop for 2021. The balance sheets of households, corporate and governments are expanding alongside the aggressive monetary policy and signs of inflation returning causing a rotation back to value and cyclical growth supported by a steepening yield curve.
* GDP is seeing rising 6.4% globally in 2021 according to Morgan Stanley, the consensus is for 5.4% growth. In the US those numbers are 5.9% and 3.8% respectively.
* Inflation would be the key risk into 2021 with it likely to start showing up in 2H21, and the risk being an overshoot could start a disruptive shift in Fed policy. Surging debt remains another concern, as a share of U.S. GDP, total debt has spiked near a record high and total nonfinancial debt has surged to new all-time highs. The rapid increase in government deficits is due to the combination of 1) the budget shortfall that already existed and was growing, plus 2) the deficit spending to fund the stimulus programs to date.
* The other clear risk in 2021 is China where debt defaults are rising and could spark a move to credit tightening and a recession that would strangle the global recovery. The overall default rate is currently low but the percentage spike in debt/GDP was the highest since 2009 which could lead to policy tightening in 2021.

**Market Valuation and Fundamentals:**

* The NASDAQ continue to outperform in 2020 with a 45%+ YTD return compared to the S&P at +15% as major secular trends in technology continue to play out. The trend of rapid rotational moves also continue with growth often seeing selling pressure for a few days before quickly recovering and resuming the longer-term uptrends. Into 2021 earnings growth is expected to be a record though room for multiple expansion is minimal. A combination of improving economic conditions causing greater business and consumer confidence should drive strong earnings growth in 2021. Increased fiscal spending and a moderation of tariffs provide additional tailwinds. In 2020 many businesses shedded labor and transformed business models to higher productivity to offset the collapse in demand and low inventories with rebounding production point to margin expansion in 2021. The 2021 environment shapes up to be one of solid earnings growth, a return of buybacks and modest multiple contraction. The growth versus value debate is likely to continue but the low-rate environment continues to favor growth, but even more-so a greater preference for quality, companies with strong balance sheets, cash flow generation, and returns on capital should continue to outperform. We are seeing historically strong earnings revision ratios and a record percentage of stocks with dividend yields above the rate of the ten-year Treasury, both conducive to allocations to equities. Compared to bonds, equities can act as a hedge in case of inflation and, with a thorough selection process, can still offer returns closer to historical returns.
* My forecasts for 2021 take into account consensus expectations, a bull case for a strong vaccine rollout, and a bear case for disruptions to the vaccine rollout and geopolicatical potential issues. I am assigning a 40% probability for the bull case, 40% for the base case, and 20% for the bear case to arrive at a S&P fair value of 3600 though 1H21. In 2H21 we start to look to 2022 estimates and feel we can approach $200 EPS with slight multiple contraction to 22X leaving upside potential to 4400 for year-end 2021.

[https://imgur.com/a/QqPjfbU](https://imgur.com/a/QqPjfbU)

* For 2021, the bottom-up EPS estimate (which reflects an aggregation of the median EPS estimates for CY 2021 for all of the companies in the index) is $169.20. For CY 2021, analysts are projecting earnings growth of 21.7% and revenue growth of 7.7%. The 6% trend growth rate since the 1930s would point to S&P 500 EPS getting back to trend levels of $187 in 2022. An optimistic vaccine scenario would see S&P 2022 EPS well above $200.

[https://imgur.com/a/lLhmsb3](https://imgur.com/a/lLhmsb3)

* The low rate environment impacts the multiple, and assuming the 10-year stays low, the Fed keeps rates at zero, and credit spreads stay firm, a valuation framework would put a trailing PE at 24X and forward at 21.5X for the current environment. The spread between the S&P dividend yield versus the corporate Baa bond yield is near historical highs and the ERP (Equity Risk Premium) is very high by many measures. Assuming the spread between the dividend yield and IG corporate yield goes back to 2012-19 levels, it would point to 30%- plus upside for S&P 500 valuations. Assuming some rise in rates as the spread narrows more from falling equity yields would point to 20%-plus upside. In 2021, policy support should remain in place to curtail risk aversion. Besides the risk of a credit crisis, concerns over a late-cycle overheating have been pushed further out due to the pandemic-induced recession and policy makers’ increased inflation tolerance. When comparing relative attractiveness across asset classes, which ultimately steers a substantial part of investment flows, equity markets continue to look quite attractive. Since the beginning of 2020, real bond yields in the USA have declined by over 100 basis points, outpacing the decline in earnings yields (inverse of the price-earnings ratio), thus supporting higher valuation multiples. Currently the difference between the earnings yield and the real bond yield as a measure for the equity risk premium (ERP) is higher than the long-term average, suggesting that equities offer an attractive excess return over bonds. Although lower interest rates support higher multiples due to the increase value of future earnings, a return to normal could push long-term interest rates higher and exert downward pressure on equity valuation multiples.

**Analyst 2021 Predictions:**

* Morgan Stanley: $3900 - After a year of big swings in valuations, 2021 will be about who can deliver on earnings. 2020 was all about beta and understanding how equity markets trade in and around a recession that handed us the fattest pitch we’ve seen in a decade. 2021 will be much more about stock picking (alpha) and should favor those companies that can deliver earnings growth that isn’t already expected or priced. MSCO prefers companies with earnings growth most tied to re-openings and an economic recovery and also favors small caps. Financials are also preferred due to positive upside skew on rising rates and better credit; Materials and Industrials on demand rebound, earnings leverage and inflation protection; and Health Care given its GARP characteristics and re-rating potential with fading political overhangs.
* Bank of America: $3800 - Stocks have already priced in much of the expected recovery in the economy and corporate profitability, leaving just slightly more upside heading into next year. Even as investors ride a wave of vaccine-related optimism, potential negative catalysts abound. The recovery is intact and the world likely reopens in the 2H, but a lot of optimism is priced in already on vaccine/recovery. Vaccine execution risk, delayed fiscal stimulus and longer lockdowns are risks. But a few themes support stocks: the S&P 500 dividend yield is 3x the 10-year yield, and S&P 500 dividends are set to increase in 2021. And unlike bond yields, earnings are nominal and participate in inflationary upside – where inflation risks may be running higher, given rampant money-printing and a potential post-vaccine spike in demand. BAML picks value stocks over growth, cyclicals over defensives and small caps over large caps, given each of these groups’ likelihoods to be disproportionately boosted by a post-virus economic recovery.
* Goldman Sachs: $4300 - A vaccine is a more important development for the economy and markets than the prospective policies of a Biden presidency. The economic reopening coming alongside a vaccine, in tandem with a status quo policy environment cemented with a divided government, will help push the S&P 500 to 4,300 by year-end 2021 and then to 4,600 by the end of 2022. The forecast assumes that the Senate will remain under Republican control following the Georgia run-off elections in January, the economy will continue on a path toward a “V-shaped” recovery, corporate profits will rebound, Fed funds rate will hold near-zero and the yield curve will steepen while the 10-year Treasury yield climbs only modestly.
* Deutsche Bank: $3950 - Much of 2020’s run-up in the stock market came with multiples expansion, as prices escalated despite a drop in earnings, as companies dealt with fallout due to the coronavirus pandemic. Next year, as the economy recovers and a vaccine allows for long-lasting re-openings, earnings growth will rebound and multiples will de-rate. The pattern of the equity market recovery, bottoming halfway through recession and recouping most of its losses before it’s over, has been typical but the continued run-up means valuations are high. In our reading, elevated multiples reflect increased participation of retail investors which we see as sustaining, but we expect the multiple to begin to de-rate. For 2021, a recovery in earnings — which essentially increases the denominator of the price-earnings ratio — should lower multiples. That said, an increase in companies’ payout ratios as dividends and buybacks return could at least partially offset this. A gradual correction of overvaluation argues for the current overvaluation of 5 multiple points to diminish but remain significant at 3.6 points, putting the end-2021 multiple at 20.5X.
* Jefferies: $4200 - Improving prospects for a vaccine, easy lending conditions and broader participation among cyclical and value stocks will help propel the stock market higher in 2021. November’s historic stock market rally, led by cyclical and value stocks in the energy, financials and industrials sectors, reflected broadening equity strength beyond just big tech and software shares. That rotation is anticipated to continue into next year, helping push the broader market higher. Notwithstanding the second and third Covid-19 waves permeating the world, there is a palpable feeling that the global economy is resynchronizing with the household, corporate and government balance sheets expanding simultaneously alongside aggressive monetary policy. The much-maligned value and cyclical growth sectors are slowly making a comeback as inflation pressures begin to return. This rotation has been supported by a steepening in the yield curve and with growthier stocks trading sideways. Improved visibility towards a successful coronavirus vaccine, easier lending conditions, little evidence of deflation and a sentiment switch from growth to value will lift US bank shares through 2021. Rising global capacity utilization rates, firmer producer prices, improving world trade volume, booming housing/autos and a weak dollar are the perfect environment for the S&P 500 Industrials. The S&P 500 materials sector is blowing off in response to a weak dollar, higher commodity prices, an upswing in global manufacturing and a restocking cycle.
* CSFB: $4050 - Our 2021 forecasts are designed to answer a simple question: what the future will (2022) look like in the future (end of 2021). From this perspective, we are forced to de-emphasize the near-term, focusing instead on the return to a more normal world. As we look toward 2022, the virus will be a fading memory, the economy robust, but decelerating, the yield curve steeper and volatility lower, and the rotation into cyclicals largely behind us. Since the stock market discounts future events, each of these prospects for further improvement down the line should translate into a higher S&P 500 as investors price in these events.
* UBS: $4100 - The vaccine-related developments that drove stocks’ gains in November and early December have now been baked into market expectations, leaving vaccine distribution the next milestone for equity investors to consider in 2021. The key driver of U.S. equities will be the pace of vaccinations, similar to how shifts in mobility drove equities through the spring and summer. As people get vaccinated, they are likely to ‘normalize’ spending on areas impacted by COVID shortly thereafter. We see the rotation toward cyclical services spending and other COVID-hit areas as a key investment theme for 2021. UBS is overweight the consumer discretionary, industrials and energy sectors given that consumption and production will likely rebound next year. It downgraded materials and financials to Neutral. It is also Underweight consumer staples, utilities and REITs and Neutral on information technology, but overweight communication services and health care on still attractive growth relative to valuations. UBS maintained an upside case for the S&P 500 of 4,400, which would emerge in the case of higher-than-baseline growth against a backdrop of still-low interest rates. However, in a downside case, the S&P 500 could fall to 3,300, which would entail a weaker recovery and/or tighter financial conditions.
* BMO Capital: $4200 - Heading into 2021, stocks are poised to keep reaping the benefits of the massive infusion of monetary support from the Federal Reserve, along with an anticipated additional round of fiscal stimulus. This constructive policy environment is likely to help push equities higher even as virus concerns linger for at least the first several months of the new year. Even with recent positive vaccine and treatment developments, the global pandemic and its unprecedented impact is unlikely to fade in coming months. As such, the massive fiscal and monetary response in the U.S. and around the world (also unprecedented) will likely remain in place to combat its negative economic impact for the foreseeable future. Such environments have historically supported continued stock market gains and we see no reason why 2021 will be any different. Aside from the global financial crisis, 2020 represented the swiftest quarter-over-quarter earnings collapse for the S&P 500 where index EPS plummeted nearly 50% during 1Q, thus, we anticipate that 2021 has the potential to be one of the best years ever in terms of earnings growth, something we believe will also help to push stock prices higher. We remain optimistic and expect another year of double-digit gains as the economy and society slowly transition back to normal.
* Barclays: $4000 - Markets are right to be optimistic about the global economic outlook in 2021, with growth returning and inflation rising but staying below central bank targets. Projected global gross domestic product growth of 5.6% in 2021, rebounding from a 3.6% contraction this year, with most Western economies reaching so-called herd immunity from Covid-19 in the second and third quarters of the year. Forecasts reflected the recent slew of positive vaccine results with efficacy rates exceeding expectations, which point to a significant boost for growth in the second quarter of 2021. Barclays also suggested the inflation outlook would not indicate any unwinding of current unprecedented levels of central bank support. Labor markets are recovering, but we are still at very high unemployment, so there is undeniably a lot of slack in the system. That means that when it comes to core inflation and the underlying drivers, to wage costs etc., that was unlikely to happen in the short run, meaning even next year. It would take several years really to come back. While Barclays anticipates a gradual improvement in inflation, it will not be significant enough to cause central banks to consider tightening their accommodative monetary policy stances. We have an environment whereby growth comes back, inflation stays relatively muted, and you have central banks continuing to support the recovery, and tightening is still far out.
* Oppenheimer: $4300 - The S&P 500 is likely to post another double-digit percentage gain in 2021 as the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines underpins a lasting economic recovery. This outcome is based on six key assumptions: First, that the public will expediently accept and receive COVID-19 vaccines and second, that equity investors will discount the success of the vaccines in reversing the disruptions brought on by the pandemic. Thirdly assumes that at least one of the two Senate seats in the Georgia runoff election will go to a Republican lawmaker, thereby retaining their control of the Senate and reducing (if not necessarily eliminating) the risk that the Biden administration will eradicate the corporate tax reform act of 2017. Fourth, the Federal Reserve will continue its low interest rate regime in tandem with accommodative monetary policy, and fifthly, that congressional lawmakers will step in with another round of fiscal stimulus by the first quarter of 2021 at the latest. Lastly, that investor appetite will continue to tilt toward “stocks that favor diversification and both growth and value segments of the market in a relatively low interest rate environment that favors equities, real assets and other asset classes over fixed income for intermediate and longer-term objectives. The vaccine rollout is arguably the most important in determining the trajectory of the S&P 500 next year. Ultimately the stock market is broadly dependent on economic growth to drive revenues and earnings across the sectors.
* JP Morgan: $4400 - Investors are entering 2021 against a confluence of market-positive events, including improving prospects for widespread vaccinations and sustained economic reopening, gridlock in Washington and accommodative central bank policy. Given the COVID-19 crisis, vaccine distribution is likely the linchpin event. But even with widespread vaccine availability still months away, optimism over early vaccine efficacy data has already sparked a rally among stocks hardest-hit by the pandemic. The equity market is facing one of the best backdrops for sustained gains in years. After a prolonged period of elevated risks (global trade war, COVID-19 pandemic, U.S. election uncertainty, etc.), the outlook is significantly clearing with the business cycle expanding and risks diminishing. We expect a ‘market nirvana’ scenario for equities with the melt-up continuing into 1H21, driven by earnings recovery and multiple expansion. Much of next year’s stock market rise is likely to come at the beginning of the year, as lingering uncertainties over vaccine distribution, the results of the Georgia senate race and additional monetary and fiscal stimulus start to dissipate. While the broader backdrop should still remain constructive in the second half of next year, by then the market will have likely priced in close to a full recovery and investors may start to expect a gradual shift in central bank forward guidance away from the current exceptionally accommodative stance.
* BTIG - $4000 - Global synchronized growth underpinned by central bank ease and a Washington which sees Election 2020’s decidedly mixed outcomes as a catalyst for cooperation (spend, it’s necessary) and centrist government (no tax hikes) results in a Redistribution of Wealth consistent with the 2003-06 synchronized reflation period where Value outperformed.

**Gold:**

* [Monthly](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/GLD/TUbcSBg2-GLD/)
* Gold had a solid year in 2020 gaining more than 20% as a long base breakout that triggered in June 2019 continued to play out higher and reached its measured move objective while the rally briefly broke above 2011 highs before pulling back. If we look at Fibonacci extension targets of the 2011-2015 correction GLD has upside targets at $207 and $220. The 2018-2020 rally has Fibonacci retracement support levels at $162.5 and $152.5. Gold rallied in 2020 on economic uncertainty and a flight to safety and has pulled back in Q4 with the greater optimism for 2021 taking hold. On an allocation basis, Gold may be losing some of its luster as a store of value with the momentum seen in Bitcoin , although that has not been seen to this point with global gold ETF inflows topping a record in 2020 as a way to diversify portfolios and hedge against inflation. However, November saw the second largest outflow on record. In 2020 the lockdowns resulted in a 5% decline in global output, so the supply-side is expected to rebound in 2021. Gold prices should be supported by inflationary pressures, a deep fiscal deficit and a weaker USD. Goldman sees Gold reaching $2300 in 2021 as recovery from the coronavirus-related recession fuels higher inflation next year. Further fuel could be added from a recovery in demand from India and China._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Is there anything wrong with investing in multiple ETF’s? I am invested in multiple ETF’s.

> Elon Musk's big message was that Tesla was close to reaching the holy grail of fully self-driving cars. Musk predicts that by the end of the year, Tesla's cars will be able to navigate both surface streets and freeways, allowing them to drive between any two points without human input.
> 
> At this point, the cars will be "feature complete," in Musk's terminology, but will still need a human driver to monitor the vehicle and intervene in the case of a malfunction. But Musk predicts it will only take about six more months for the software to become reliable enough to no longer require human supervision. By the end of 2020, Musk expects Tesla to have thousands of Tesla vehicles providing driverless rides to people in an Uber-style taxi service.
> 
> In other words, Musk seems to believe that once Tesla's cars become "feature complete" later this year, they will be 90 percent of the way to full autonomy. The big question is whether that's actually true—or whether it's only true in the Cargill sense.

I bet this is a pretty dumb question to ask, but I think the answer I receive will also give me knowledge on the stock market itself.

So, how does QQQJ increase in value? If they are invested in the 101-200th NASDAQ companies, is it because when the companies they hold raise in value and get into the top 100, they sell the shares with their profits and reinvest it into the next 101-200? How does this ETF make money if it's caps itself to 101-200? Is it also because as the stock market itself increases, the average value of the 101-200 increase as well? Are both of these theories correct and both together have a compounding effect?

On this note, does an ETF like this pose a large risk? It seems to me that considering it follows the NASDAQ, it should still increase in price over time similarly to SPY with the S&P 500. If this is the case, what is stopping me from selling all my SPY shares and investing in this lower-cost ETF? Is it because the 101-200 is more volatile?

I know Reddit isn't the best place for advice, but I don't know where else to turn. I'll try and give as much background information as possible since that seems to be appreciated here (for good reason). Also, I understand that I am very fortunate and ahead of the game, so please spare me those comments.

I just turned 18 and I have about $16k to my name from working, investing through a custodial account, and money from my grandparents. My parents are paying for my college along with the scholarships that I earned and I will major in either Mechanical Engineering or Electrical Engineering and potentially shoot for an employer sponsored MBA after that to get to a managerial position.

Seeing my parents' situation (they didn't exactly start investing young and will likely not be able to retire until 65 or 70) I have always made it a priority to be financially responsible. It's also in my nature to not spend money, and I am a minimalist. I have taken 4 years of business classes at my high school (for what that's worth) and have followed the investing world, having skin in the game since age 13. Since then, I have had a mutual fund with my parents' financial advisor that underperformed the S&P and had commission fees, but I wasn't so keen on all of that back then and still managed to see profits in this long bull market. I just liquidated it.

I set up a Roth IRA on my 18th birthday and am waiting for some checks to clear to my new bank account so I can make my $6k contribution for 2020 (the deadline is  in Apri 15, 2021 I think, but I will invest in January).  I was doing the math on going all in on FXAIX (0.015% expense ratio S&P 500 index fund) on the ~10% S&P returns with the $6k annual contribution and looking at the numbers. Even with other investments, which I will be sure to have (suggestions on the types of accounts to use besides Roth IRA appreciated, if there are any) it will take. let's just say a long time to retire (I might be wrong, but I can't really predict my salary, living expenses, and how much retirement will cost).

However, everywhere I look I see people making life-changing investments. I get that it's a bull market, but whether it be TSLA or BTC, I can't help but compare what would be my measly 10% returns to their "I can retire now" returns. And seeing as snowboarding is my greatest passion, and it isn't exactly an old man's hobby, I evny that seriously. I get that this leads to emotional and return chasing investing, but it's got to be excruciating watching your portfolio grow slowly at your 9-5 while you have some Bitcoin kids driving around in Lambos, right? Even if I dabble into stock picking by researching fundamentals, my returns will not be THAT great, and would have to risk a large portion of my portfolio in order to realize them.

I have been watching the price of BTC just because I found it interesting, and while I understand some of the fundamental technology, and probably understand it more than some of the people that got rich off of it, I don't have a deep understanding of it, and never invested. Now each day I watch the price climb I get frustrated, and I got very emotional watching this video for some reason:
https://youtu.be/-ZqQNaNcDz4

I also find myself watching clickbaity YouTube videos and even some of the ads, I know the ADS about basically ways to "get rich quick." The appeal is starting to crack me now that I am beginning to put my life in perspective.

I know that this post has kind of been all over the place and really long, but I am kind of emotional about it (I am crying while writing this for some reason). I know that emotions are really bad for investment decisions, and I will only make them when I have a clear head and can think logically. I guess that I'm facing the fact that I don't really know how risk tolerant I am (not based on my age, but just personally)? Am I internalizing the debate between "S&P 500 INDEX FUNDS FOREVER, YOU CANT BEAT THE MARKET" and "TSLA CALLS, STOCKS ONLY GO UP, BUY HIGH SELL LOW LOL, BTC 🚀"? One certainly sounds more fun...

If we look back at the short term since the inception of things like Dow Jones industrial average or S&P 500 index, it has certainly risen since its inception until now. The question is, will these market index markers continue to increase indefinitely?

For example, we may simply look at the past and make the assumption that Dow Jones will reach 900,000 in 35 years, which may or may not occur (because if that is the case, why wouldn't anyone simply dump as much money as possible into these indexes for an almost GUARANTEED long term return of gargantuan magnitude).

If individual companies grow and bust but the market index only picks the strongest of players, what would it take for this indefinite increase to be not a reality? Are we talking about a financial crash that will remove the USA from the global financial stage or the US Dollar weakened to a degree where it will no longer hold significant meaning in the global currency sense?

New trader here. I have been learning about trend lines and moving averages, and they seem like pretty simple tools to use to figure out where a stock is going.  I was wondering how often options traders use these to establish positions, and how more fundamental analysis plays a part amidst these other tools. How important is it to know things like who is running the company, its assets/liabilities, etc? Thank you all and Happy New Year!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ I'm using a advisor for a chunk of cash. Considering pulling it and doing it myself. I like my guy but I'm just curious if I should just VTSAX and chill? I have around $300,000 with them. I haven't contributed any money to it in a long time. But I do feel like it should be performing a little bit better but I want to take a more active role and putting it into my own Vanguard account (Even with their antiquated and clunky app) seems better than the TD Ameritrade adviser client app. I can't see percentage gains and other functionality very well.

 I guess I'm just asking why shouldn't I just do this myself rather than paying somebody else a 1% fee_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Let's reflect on our performance in 2020 *Happy New Year, folks! It's certainly been an interesting one.*

*I thought it would be interesting to look back on how we did for the year and reflect on what went right and what didn't.*

I'll go first. This year, my CAGR ended up around a tidy 30% (Personal RoR, although my TWRoR is similar). 

I'm quite happy with my performance, given my relative inexperience (I've only been in this game for ~4 years, and this was my first year trading options). We'll see how much of it I'll have to give back in the next correction.

**What did I do right?**

Well, my core positions have been pretty consistent. ~15% of my portfolio is in semiconductors, mainly TSM, and the structural advantages, increasing applications, and large moat that this industry has continues to pay off. 

My next largest sector is consumer discretional retail (AMZN, BABA, MELI, RTH, WMT), which saw a huge boost because of the lockdown. I am worried about seeing some pullback next year and shoppers return to their previous habits, but we'll handle that if/when it occurs.

My biggest gains have been from well-timed purchases of smaller cap companies: BJRI, BLMN, M, JWN, DLTR, and AAL were all very kind to me.

ARKK, ICLN, and QCLN have been good ways of getting exposure to areas where I don't have a strong point of view, but see potential for continued gains.

I got into SPACs the last few months of the year. It's a relatively low-information market, and seems somewhat luck-based, but I have made some successful plays there as well.

My decision in August to keep any funds not allocated to an active strategy or thesis in VTI and VTWO instead of in BND or as cash has paid off, due to low interest rates and asset inflation.

**What was just OK?**

My third largest sector is healthcare, which underperformed relative to the eyepopping gains in tech and retail. I'm alright with the opportunity cost there.

I made a small investment into Bitcoin, which I sold at $19k after a 16% gain. I should have held (hedled?) - but I have trouble remaining confident in investments without a strong underlying value investing thesis.

My luck with short-selling has been poor this year. My short positions in GSX and NKLA were pretty successful, but I lost a lot of money shorting FCPT, ACC, BLMN, and BJRI earlier in the year. On the other hand, the excellent performance of BJRI and BLMN meant I later turned them into (ultimately very profitable) long positions, which I likely wouldn't have discovered without the initial short thesis.

There are so many astounding run-ups I knew about rather early on and missed out on: TSLA, MRNA, NIO, PLTR, QS. The hype around these tickers and the sky-high PE ratios scared me off, which might not be a good response in the current market regime. That said, my investing style has to fit my philosophy and psychology to work, so I'll remain disciplined in trying to find opportunities that match my approach.


**What choices were mistakes?**

I tried options this year. I began by paper trading options and lost a lot of (fake money). I then moved on the real-life option plays, and basically broke even. Even so, the stress is *unreal*. I understand how the option greeks and Black-Scholes works, but it still catches me by surprise when the price moves in my favor and my positions lose money anyway. The wide bid/ask spreads and crazy volatility is really hard to deal with, and a single options play starts to take up more space in my head than the rest of my portfolio. As a result, I often end up selling too soon. I don't think directional options plays are for me. I may try selling covered calls in the future.

About 60% of the time I've tried to catch a falling knife this year, I've failed. OTGLY and SWI are two good examples. I'm still not sure how to deal with this.

I suck at scalping - My attempts at day-trading SPXL and SPXS during March and April's high-volatility periods destroyed the subsequent 3 months of returns.

**What did I learn?**

Value investing is still alive and well in 2020 - you just need to understand how to look for opportunities and value growing companies.

I need to respect the tax man: I didn't max out my 401k contribution this year because I wanted to amass some cash in order to eventually put a down payment on a property - I'm going to pay for that in April.

I still don't know where the sweet spot is for leverage. I know options aren't it for me, but I can't help but feel that I could improve my returns by levering up on my high-conviction, low-volatility plays. I'll continue to explore this in 2021.

I finally paid off my student loans (30K USD). I was lucky to land a job out of graduation this year. I graduated in April 2020, and started working in May. My annual salary is around 80-85K. I just turned 25. 

I have around 50K ready to be used. I’m thinking of keeping 5k for emergency fund reasons. 

I was thinking of just putting in 45k spread across various ETFs in a roboadvisor. I’m a fairly new investor so I’m still learning.

My friend on the other hand has made a lot of money with successful investments. He’s won big with Shopify, NVIDIA, Amazon, etc. Easily has over $300K now in assets. He kinda inspires me. Lol. He tells me that at the annual return rate of even 10% per year for ETF’s is nothing. Doesn’t excite him. But he told me I need to really do my research on individual stocks if I were to purchase them. 

On the OTHER hand, I was just thinking why not just save up money and move out eventually? But the thing is... my lifestyle at this current moment doesn’t really call for a drastic move like moving out. I live at my dads and I don’t pay rent/food. I do feel like sometimes I’m missing out?

Happy holidays and thank you!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Dumb question about investing 1,000 dollars into VTI. So, let's say I invest 1,000 dollars into VTI and I get an annual rate of return of 10%. After 1 year, my investment becomes 1,100 dollars. 

My question is, after another year and it appreciates another 10%, does it become 1,200 dollars or 1,210 dollars? Because fundamentally, I still just started with 1,000 dollars, right? so I don't really understand how the whole time in the market and exponential growth thing is supposed to work. When I watch videos on youtube, I'm led to believe that the answer should be 1,210 dollars but in my mind, I feel like it should be 1,200.

I'm trying to get better at analyzing companies. Please let me know what you think of this! I REALLY do appreciate any and all input! Thank you. I originally posted this in another forum but I'm posting this here to get y'all's thoughts on this analysis. Please let me know what you think!

Best Buy is a seriously undervalued stock at the moment. This is a fundamental investment idea and full disclosure I AM NOT A PROFESSIONAL TRADER.

Alright let’s get down to it. 

The below information is a comparison between the Nine Months Ending of November 2, 2019 and October 31, 2020. BBY pulled back from a 52 Week high of $124.89 to right around $99.79 today. This has happened despite a rather substantial increase in many metrics. These metrics are a culmination of both domestic and international stores. However, BBY is ceasing all operations in Mexico hopefully by early fiscal 2022. They will remain in Canada (which will now be their only international business segment). 

· Retained earnings increased 23.2%

· Diluted EPS increased from 2.96 to 3.74

· Revenue increased from 1.3% to 6.6%

· SG&A as % of Revenue DECREASED from 20.1% to 18.3%

· Domestic online revenue grew roughly 174%

​

Below is a breakdown of their business segments and how their sales increased:

· Computing and Mobile Phones: The 21.5% comparable sales gain was driven primarily by computing and tablets, partially offset by declines in mobile phones.

· Consumer Electronics: The 21.1% comparable sales gain was driven primarily by home theater and digital imaging. 

· Appliances: The 39.3% comparable sales gain was driven by large and small appliances.

· Entertainment: The 17.5% comparable sales gain was driven primarily by gaming, virtual reality and drones, partially offset by declines in movies.

· Services: The 12.7% comparable sales gain was primarily due to our warranty and support services.

​

Below is some general information about BBY and a few quotes from their latest quarterly report:

General Info:

· BBY increased ALL employees pay to a minimum of $15 an hour

o This is huge because it is statistically proven that the amount of pay employees receive directly effects their performance, and therefore BBY’s performance.

o I realize it’s not huge, but when you are struggling that is a huge deal

· They issued $650 million in new notes due Oct 1, 2030 at 1.95%. They are using this to pay off $650 million debt coming due March 15, 2021 at 5.50% - Huge savings for them

· They donated 40 million to their foundation to help reach their goal of 100 Teen Tech Centers

o This helps underserved kids to have access to technology

Quotes: Very important info here!

· “On February 23, 2019, our Board of Directors authorized a $3.0 billion share repurchase program. There is no expiration date governing the period over which we can repurchase shares under the February 2019 authorization. On March 21, 2020, we announced the suspension of all share repurchases to conserve liquidity in light of COVID-19-related uncertainties. We resumed repurchases in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021.” 

o “As of October 31, 2020, $1.9 billion of the $3.0 billion share repurchase authorization was available.”

· “Our better-than-expected sales resulted in significant operating income rate expansion and earnings growth of 33% over the same period last year.”

------- And here is the best one -------

· “Historically, we have generated a large proportion of our revenue and earnings in the fiscal fourth quarter, which includes the majority of the holiday shopping season in the U.S., Canada and Mexico.”

o Their sales and revenue have increased substantially AND their MOST profitable quarter is yet to be reported. 

​

So, what does all this mean?

The buybacks alone should increase the stock 5%. 

They are raking in money hand over fist, despite their most profitable quarter not being reported. 

They are getting the fuck out of Mexico (it wasn’t profitable this year and barely profitable in years prior)

They took advantage of the current interest rates and are restructuring their debt, smart.

They are investing in their employees by paying them more AND helping them with COVID related hardships

TLDR:

BBY has drastically increased their revenue due to a huge increase in sales while managing to actually reduce their costs as a % of revenue. Their most profitable quarter (4th quarter) is yet to be reported and I know they will perform.

I've been making good money off NLY since 2004.  "Making" might be a stretch as I paid $9.94, but I've been living well off the dividends for a couple years now.

Now Zack's is saying it could double next year, which would surely make me happy, but I'd be happier if they just raise their dividends for the first time in a LOOONG time!
