CALPERS buys hundreds of thousands of shares in NKLA, NIO, and ZM The largest public pension in the U.S. by assets increased its bets on makers of electric vehicles, and a videoconferencing stock in the third quarter.

California Public Employees’ Retirement System, or Calpers, raised investments in Nikola ￼ (NKLA) and NIO ￼ (NIO) in the period, and nearly doubled an investment in Zoom Video Communications ￼ (ZM). It also edged up an investment in Tesla ￼ (TSLA). Calpers disclosed the stock trades, among others, in a form it filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

The pension, which manages nearly $400 billion in assets, declined to comment on the investment changes.

Calpers bought 205,792 more Nikola shares to end the third quarter with 261,546 shares of the maker of trucks powered by alternative fuels. The pension had bought in a volatile period for Nikola stock. Shares have fallen in the second half of 2020, plunging 70% in the third quarter alone, and slipping 3.4% so far in the fourth quarter.

A short seller’s report in September alleged Nikola management overstated its internally developed battery and fuel-cell capabilities. The company disputed the report and called it misleading. Another negative report in November alleged that Nikola had considered using customers’ deposits to fund Nikola One, a truck in development that will be powered by hydrogen fuel cells. Nikola also denied that allegation.

NIO, a Chinese maker of electric-powered vehicles, has seen its American depositary receipts multiply 11 times in value this year, and have more than doubled since the end of September. Those gains far outstrip the 11% year-to-date rise in the S&P 500 index, a broad measure of the market. Since the end of September, the index has gained 6.6%.

J.P. Morgan issued a bullish note on NIO ADRs in mid-October, and the company’s deliveries were strong that month. We have noted that trading volume in NIO ADRs is at elevated levels.

Calpers bought 381,439 more NIO ADRs to end September with 2.3 million.

The pension also added 312,406 Zoom shares in the third quarter, lifting its investment to 653,764 shares.

Zoom stock has surged nearly 500% in 2020, including a 14% slide since the end of the third quarter.

The advent of Zoom and videoconferencing has left televisions behind, we have noted. The company announced in October that it will begin collecting communications taxes in certain states. Zoom stock slipped last week on a sign that a coronavirus vaccine could be available soon.

Calpers bought 38,373 additional Tesla shares in the third quarter to edge up its holdings to 1.69 million shares.

Tesla stock has rocketed nearly 400% this year through Friday’s close, including a 4.8% slip since the end of September.

The electric-vehicle giant’s earnings have been strong. There has been speculation Tesla stock could join the S&P 500. Recently a prominent investor blamed a mania for Tesla stock for hurting his short position in the shares.

Just wanting to post an exciting tidbit I came across.

Berotralstat is a drug for hereditary angioedema  that is almost certain to receive FDA approval on Dec 3. A [recent article in Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-76488-2) indicates that it has promise for treating pulmonary edema in COVID-19 patients. Now I'm retarted, especially when it comes to medical shit, but that means fluid in the lungs and it's not uncommon in severe COVID cases.

BCRX has other promising drugs in their pipeline that probably won't affect the stock price for a little while (unless positive Galidesivir news comes in before EOY). Berotralstat is the only (almost) sure thing, but HAE is an an incredibly rare disease. So it's obviously a huge deal if there's a bigger market than anticipated.

Just to mess with autists...

Anyways, CMPS is a biotech company that has received breakthrough therapy status from the FDA in the US and is using a patented synthetic version of psilocybin (i.e., the active agent in “magic mushrooms”). CMPS is targeting the treatment-resistant depression (TRD) market of >100 million people who have tried two or more existing treatments without success.

The state or Oregon just legalized mushrooms. And several other states continue the momentum towards rightful legalization. 

A bunch of mid-tier investment banks give $CMPS a Buy rating and a significantly higher price target than it’s currently trading. 

I guess a “downer” is that stock-scammer Andrew Left of Citron really likes COMPASS, gave it a $100 price target a month ago. Take that with a grain of salt... here’s Citron’s full report:

TL;DR - This could be big.  If Palantir did develop Tiberius which is going to be used for centralized monitoring, reporting of COVID infections for each state/countries in real time --> then this data feed goes into population and age based risks algorithm, then sends distribution requests directly to vaccine manufacturers (pfizer) + to transport partners.

Collect $1.14 per share in dividends (5.45% yield) and target long term capital gain of 82% within a year (based on my price target of $38)

**My positions:** Over the last few weeks I have been accumulating shares on any dips – I own 40k shares at an average price of $17.22 (currently have an unrealized capital gain of 21%). I plan on holding for more than a year to collect the juicy dividend, get favorable tax treatment, and significant capital gains based on returning to pre-COVID stock price level.

**Company Background**

Stock Price (11/13 close): $20.88

Market Capitalization: $4.25B

Annual Dividend: $1.14 per share (5.45%)

WARNING: This is a boomer stock. This is not a pre-revenue EV stock valued based on stolen graphic design renderings. This is not a SPAC pump and dump or a pre-revenue tech company. I realize this is going to be outside the wheelhouse of the short attention span of most WSB players. But I think this is also a long-term lock for big gains with little risk and these asymmetric risks are ideal for long term candidates. 

Unum (UNM) is a Fortune 500 insurance company based in Chattanooga, TN. They primarily sell group disability and life insurance to other companies in the US and UK. 182k businesses get insurance through UNM – including one in three Fortune 500 companies. They also offer other insurance policies like accident, critical illness, dental, and vision (and historically offered Long Term Care Insurance). 

Below is a historical financial summary (numbers from SA):

$ in millions | 2015 | 2016 | 2017 | 2018 | 2019 | TTM
:--|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
Revenues | 10,731.3 | 11,046.5 | 11,286.8 | 11,598.5 | 11,998.9 | 11,923.2 
EBITDA | 1,490.6 | 1,615.4 | 1,667.3 | 896.5 | 1,696.9 | 	1,521.1
Basic EPS | $3.51 | $3.96 | $4.39 | $2.38 | $5.25 | $4.67

**Investment Thesis**

1. Strong revenue and earnings even during COVID – for the third quarter of 2020, UNM reported net income of $231.1 million ($1.13 per share), compared to net income of $242.0 million ($1.16 per share) for the third quarter of 2019. COVID had a give and take impact on the business – they collect less premiums when employment goes down but COVID also lead to lower claims in some lines of business like their dental and vision insurance as people put off care. There was elevated mortality which lead to higher claims on their life insurance business. But overall, their earnings have seen little impact from COVID while their share price has been completely hammered. 

2. Valuation – this stock is insanely cheap. In February 2020 (immediately pre-COVID), the stock was trading close to $30.  Current PE ratio (TTM) is 4.47. Per the third quarter results, book value per common share is now up to $53.50 (14.6 percent growth compared to the year-ago quarter). It is trading at less than 50% of book value. 

3. Dividend Yield – current dividend is $1.14 per share (5.45% dividend yield). The dividend has been growing for the last 12 years. The 10 year dividend CAGR is 13.22%. Current payout ratio is under 23% so the dividend is about as safe as it gets.  

4. Share buy-backs – in the past, the Board has authorized massive share repurchases. In May 2019, they authorized $750m of share repurchases. In 2019, they repurchased 12.3 million shares for $400.4 million. This was suspended during COVID, but it shows an appetite for buying back shares and that management thought the company was undervalued even in May 2019 when it was trading at $36 per share. 

5. Technicals – the stock is currently trading near historic support areas with limited downside, significant support, and lots of room for upside.
 
**Headwinds**

Investors have primarily criticized UNM for the increases to reserves in the closed block Long Term Care (LTC) business. I think the market is putting too much emphasis on this business – and as morbid as it sounds, COVID is actually helping the Company here. 

In the past, UNM tried to make a profit on LTC insurance and failed like many other insurers. They made bad assumptions on lapse rates and longevity which has cost them a lot of money – these policies are incredibly unprofitable now that people survive a long time in assisted living facilities and nursing homes. In 2009 they closed the individual LTC business and in 2012 they closed the group business. Even though the block has been closed, they have repeatedly dumped more money to increase their reserves. Earlier this year, the Company came to an agreement with insurance regulators in Maine to add $2.1b in reserves over the next 7 years. 
However, COVID seems to have had a favorable impact on the closed-block business (though they won’t explicitly say this on earnings calls). A lot of the COVID deaths have happened in nursing homes which have led to increased mortality and therefore lower benefit payments. You can see this in their third quarter results: 

>As reported in the third quarter results, the Closed Block segment reported adjusted operating income of $70.8 million in the third quarter of 2020, an increase of 163.2 percent from $26.9 million in the third quarter of 2019. The interest adjusted loss ratio for the long-term care line of business was 67.4 percent in the third quarter of 2020, compared to an interest adjusted loss ratio of 89.8 percent in the third quarter of 2019, driven primarily by higher claimant mortality.

https://imgur.com/a/XKfi9v1_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ UPDATE: VIRGIN GALACTIC (SPCE) – THE $1000 CASE FOR SPCE **UPDATE: VIRGIN GALACTIC (SPCE) – THE $1000 CASE FOR SPCE**

We are updating our forecasts to incorporate wildly improbable, yet possible, scenarios for Virgin Galactic. Our updated forecasts are guided by management comments and a recent jenkem-fueled all-nighter, which we believe have not been fully appreciated by the broader market. Forecasts below and fuck you in advance.

**Bottomline: SPCE stock or LEAPS**

**Main Updates**

We are raising our forecasts for space tourism revenue, primarily driven by a significant increase in our pricing assumptions over the near term. 

We are guided by management comments that suggest there will be robust demand for a supply constrained experience:

“I am very bullish on the transformational experience that we intend to deliver and **the price points we believe we could command** for this one of a kind supply constrained product.” – Michael Colglazier (CEO), November 5, 2020

“Yes, I think our pricing strategy is going to evolve off the experience, but one of the things that I am excited about is when you have a truly incredible product and one that will be supply constrained as opposed to demand constrained, **it gives a lot of flexibility into our pricing model**.” - Jonathan Campagna (CFO), November 5, 2020

Virgin Galactic will be re-opening ticket sales in 1Q21 and we expect individuals with net worths in excess of $500Mn to bid up prices as they compete to be part of the first 3,000 ticket holders. As such, we believe that ticket prices could rise as high as $3Mn in the near term. Keep in mind, one of these sick bastards once offered to pay Britney Spears $10Mn to sleep with him….the money for outrageous shit is there.

Globally, there are approximately 10,000 people worth $500Mn+. When incorporating an estimated average family size of 5, we believe there are 50,000 people that could afford a $1Mn+ ticket price. Given the supply constraints associated with this experience, we estimate that at least 3,000 of these individuals will bid up the price to become among the first commercial astronauts. As such, we see high margin revenue showing hockey stick growth over the next three years. 

**Space Mining**

We have incorporated space mining into our VG forecasts. There is a $10,000 quadrillion asteroid out there and we believe Virgin Galactic, SpaceX and Blue Origin will be actively developing technologies over the coming years to exploit these types of situations. We see the possibility of space companies disrupting the mining industry by 2030.

**Catalysts**

We expect significant appreciation over the next 12 months. The following catalysts have the possibility to materially impact the Company’s valuation.

**November, 2020** – SpaceX launch in the next few days

**November 19-23, 2020** \- First spaceflight from Spaceport America – (Potential 2 week delay due to NM government)

**January/February 2021** – Second spaceflight from Spaceport America

**February 2021** – 4Q Earnings – update on ticket pricing and hypersonic travel

**March 2021** – Branson goes to space….VG becomes a household name (wife’s boyfriend starts talking about it)

**April-July 2021** – Leonardo DiCaprio, Katy Perry, Justin Bieber go to space.

**Technicals**

I’ve also included some lines that I drew that may or may not be important. Close over $24 on high volume breaks the 12 month wedge = stock price might go higher. Ton of options outstanding + significant short interest = possibility of massive short/gamma squeeze.

It reports earnings on 11/18 after market close.  Expectations are high.  Revenues are expected to be around 4.4 billion, a 46% increase year over year.  EPS are expected to be $2.57, an increase of 44% year over year.  NVDA has beat the last 4 earnings by an average of 11.5%.  

They are expected to have benefited from sales growth in graphic chips due to the pandemic and more people working from home, but there are concerns that supply chain disruptions could have a negative impact.  Last month,[they announced](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/october-2020-rtx-blockbuster-and-indie-game-update/) that Minecraft, Black OPS Cold War, and many other huge games would be using their RTX ray tracing technology. 

[They have also partnered](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/gpu-cloud-computing/) with every major cloud-based solution platform to optimize performance of these services through their GPU hardware. 

There have been 35 upward revisions from analysts in the last 3 months leading to this earnings report, and 0 downward revisions. 

As far as technicals go, it is undoubtedly trading at a much higher multiple that it probably should be, but we all know the entire market is extremely inflated.  It recently underwent a 14% sell off from its high of $589, and is currently sitting at $531.88.  It bounced nearly perfectly off its 50 day EMA on Friday, the Stoch RSI on the daily crossed bullish, and the MACD on the hourly is close to crossing bullish.  

My position, entered Friday, is 12/4 545c.  The IV is only 54%.  I think NVDA is set up for a run into Thursday, and could see it working back up to its all time high.   I think this could be another example of a very good earnings report that leads to a sell off after reporting because of the expectations are just insanely high.  I'm going to hopefully ride the wave into Thursday, then make the call on whether to hold through the report or not.  BOL_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Meme! Stocks! Update! TLDR: [Don’t let your memes be dreams](https://twitter.com/litcapital/status/1268987718098391041).

GameStop: Still waiting on a catalyst, but [IV is surging](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/implied-volatility-surging-gamestop-gme-133901115.html). When GME first started making its rounds, every post had a target date of January. This target is still good as we will see Black Friday sales as well as GME earnings and Christmas sales as well. There is bound to be a catalyst. Check out options activity for clues. A lot of deep ITM puts – someone is accumulating GME shares.

EV Gang: Looks like a great run, but I saw multiple WSB commenters arguing that NIO stock was fairly valued because they would be more productive than Tesla in 2032. If you are pricing to perfection for the next 12 years to justify today’s price, then it may be a good idea to take profits.

Vale: Dead meme – last post mentioning this company. However, if WSB is so confident on EVs, it may be better to sell shovels during a gold rush.

Palantir: Wow! Amazing price action! Great numbers on their recent earnings report and institutions are waking up. I don’t see any direct catalysts through December, but we may see sustained demand since large institutions had to compete with a direct listing rather than a traditional IPO. (Soros is in it to win it!)

PG&E: yes, many have all been burned on this one! However, strong buying has commenced, and it looks like we are seeing a run up. A president Biden would bail out California and PG&E.

Clang gang: Gonna be a while on this one. Markets are still discounting current prices on future earnings for gold and silver miners. We are going to see a huge increase, but the powers that be are working overtime to keep this down. I am well over 50% return on my GDX, GDXJ, and AG holdings due to CCs. Get paid to wait!

Tanker Gang: You held through the darkest night. Now is when demand may finally recover. We are looking really good on STNG, DHT and EURN. Remember that a supercycle works on a multi-year time horizon. I will bet that STNG hits $12 by early next year just because their CEO is a madlad who probably doesn’t want his options to expire worthless.

Vix: UVXY is cheap, buy shares and sell CCs in the event that a correction takes a bite out of your meme stocks!!!

Gay Bear Gang: FAANGT stocks were the market leaders through the Covid recovery. It has been a while since these stocks hit their high and it looks like they are stumbling. These are early signs of a faltering bull market.

Like you, I'm sick and tired of all these fucking posts about $NIO. A lot of people have made a lot of money, but it's soared too high too fast, and we're all late to the party. So, like you, I'm looking for the next $NIO. Personally, I don't think it's any of these 3rd-tier EV companies that everyone seems to be piling on at the moment. $FSR could be promising, but until they're actually producing, it's going to reach its ceiling pretty fast.

The thing that folks seem not to understand is that China's mandate for electric vehicles goes far beyond these niche companies that are getting so much hype at the moment. Mark my words, neither $NIO, $XPEV, or $LI will gain a significant portion of China's EV market. That isn't to say that one or more of them won't succeed, but the speculation is just out of control. The bubble may not pop tomorrow, next week, or ever, but I think it will. China's largest manufacturers have the infrastructure to pump out way more vehicles to meet Pooh's quotas, and they are already doing so.

As far as I know, these larger companies aren't being traded. So, what's an autist to do with their monies? Enter CBAK, a Chinese lithium battery producer. (EDIT: mods, intending this post to open a discussion about this and other plays that might be flying under the radar rather than push CBAK specifically, please don't delete!)

In late September, they announced that they'd produced a tabless lithium battery that supposedly has a 25% increase in energy density at 20% less cost than Tesla's, their only real competitior. In fairness, I'm not completely certain whether these figures are relative to CBAK's previous battery or to Tesla's, but in either case they claim superior performance to Tesla's. They'll be rolling out this thing in Q1 and Q2 of 2021.

Their ticker seems to banned here (too small of a market cap?) but just Google it. The time to have this on your radar was last Thursday, before it jumped about 60% on Friday, but is what it is.

CBAK already has a contract with Dongfeng motors, China's 2nd largest auto maker, which has its own EV fleet. They also make batteries for Haier, a major electronics company, so there's some diversification for you. Earnings and guidance come out EOD Monday, and I expect more to be announced, upon which this thing will moon even more than it already has. It was up to $7.00 from $3.90 at the end of Thursday on no apparent catalyst, then dipped under $6.00 and then up to $6.20 after hours. Hopefully it will dip in the meanwhile, but if you're counting on it, be ready to get fucked.

Position: \~$3k shares. Blew up 70% of my account YOLOing on SPY puts before the election and counting on this and BCRX to get me back in the game. No options available, sadly.

Edit: I'm sorry guys, really thought this one would simmer down for the day leading up to ER, but up 20% premarket. Will do you better next time--actually tried to post about it before, but the banned ticker thing came up and I had to figure out a way around it. Hopefully folks sell off before/after earnings but I think this still has plenty of upside. _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Earnings Calendar Nov 16-20: NIO, LOWE, NVDA and more! _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ How to recoup these losses? First year trading with first job out of college _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ RCEP No, that's not a ticker. It stands for Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, its a [new trade pact](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-54949260) (<-- important parts of this quoted below) between basically every major economy in the Asia Pacific region.

This is what it does. Important parts bolded:

>The RCEP is expected to eliminate a range of tariffs on imports within 20 years.  
>  
>It also includes **provisions on intellectual property, telecommunications, financial services, e-commerce and professional services**.  
>  
>But it's possible the new "rules of origin" - which officially define where a product comes from - will have the biggest impact.  
>  
>Already many member states have free trade agreements (FTA) with each other, but there are limitations.  
>  
>"The existing FTAs can be very complicated to use compared to RCEP," said Deborah Elms from the Asian Trade Centre.  
>  
>**Businesses with global supply chains might face tariffs even within an FTA because their products contain components that are made elsewhere.**  
>  
>**A product made in Indonesia that contains Australian parts, for example, might face tariffs elsewhere in the Asean free trade zone.**  
>  
>**Under RCEP, parts from any member nation would be treated equally, which might give companies in RCEP countries an incentive to look within the trade region for suppliers.**

Meaning new markets for financial services and e-commerce for companies within the bloc.

But another thing about this jumped-out at me and it was the recent Anti-trust draft legislation. Its not like the PRC, even the PLA nutjobs, to undermine some of their best companies because they're monopolies.

In context though, what they did makes sense for 2 reasons, none of which are Jack Ma:

1. Biden winning means the possibility for trade-war de-escalation. But that means leverage in various counter-veiling sectors will be important. So China is more able to pressure the US over its monopolies (Google, Amazon, etc.) if they can make the case that they've taken actions to clean-up their own act (even if they don't end-up passing meaningful antitrust legislation).
2. More importantly was *getting this fucking trade deal done*. The companies that would potentially benefit from expanding into Chinese markets need to know (or at least believe) that there will be genuine competition at some level rather than just home-field advantage for Chinese companies. So threatening anti-trust legislation to show they're serious and understand the problem could have been what helped finish the deal. But they didn't pass the law yet and the trade deal is done. So there no more incentive for China to put a lot of teeth into the final version, *if* they ever pass antitrust legislation.

These are the best answers I can come-up with for "why now?" aside from the Jack Ma grudge.

I don't have any positions to post yet but these are what I'm looking at Monday:

TL;DR - Antitrust draft law might have been head-fake to get RCEP done. Calls on China._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Texas Data Breach = Big Money Listen up cucks. This has play might be retarded but it might be the biggest play I make this year. Texas drivers licenses have experienced a data [breach](https://www.fox26houston.com/news/nearly-28-million-licensed-texas-drivers-hit-by-data-breach) that will be effecting the entire state. Now if there’s anything I learned from 2nd grade social studies, it’s that you don’t mess with Texas.

That being said, the data was being held by some shit company called Vertafore and the breach happened around August this year. Fun fact about august this year is that Vertafore got bought by a public company - Roper Technologies. Not quite the $ROPE everyone reaches for in this sub because it’s just $ROP. Since this news dropped over the weekend, we won’t see backlash until business hours this week when the gunslingin Texans start calling them and asking for their info back. Stock prices normally drop for [data breaches](https://www.forbes.com/sites/sergeiklebnikov/2019/11/06/companies-with-security-fails-dont-see-their-stocks-drop-as-much-according-to-report/?sh=34bcbf7762e0), so that’s as much as my 4 year old brain needs to make this play. I’m hoping for lots of lawsuits to make this print.

[Thanks again frens \<3](https://i.redd.it/wimsjlky2fz51.gif)_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ ÄÄŁ to the moon _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Made me think of you guys "Like every other tax, inflation acts to determine the individual and business policies we are all forced to follow. It discourages all prudence and thrift. It encourages squandering, gambling, reckless waste of all kinds. It often makes it more profitable to speculate than to produce. It tears apart the whole fabric of stable economic relationships. Its inexcusable injustices drive men toward desperate remedies." From the book Economics in One Lesson by Henry Hazlitt_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ It’s been a pleasure, retards _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Load up on PLTR, big time, or you will miss it Institutional ownership in this company went from 1% to almost 8% within a week(because it was a Direct Listing) and looking at the price charts, their average purchase range should be around $13-15.

This gives a floor for us retail investors and speculators out there. Price is UNLIKELY to go below this floor.

More institutional ownership is quite probably coming soon. This means money.

ARK, Soros sold a stake in JPM(probably, I forgot) to jump in PLTR.

Morgan Stanley raised the price target yet downgraded the stock, I don't know if it’s a dick move from their part to try to buy it at a lower price or maybe I am just over thinking.

Long term considerations:
This company is structured in a way in which the founders would gain insane amount of money if this stock prints(KINDA like how Musk benefitted from TSLA stock price)

Plus the total control of the founders(much like lizard man Zuck have over FB) mean shareholders cannot pull any funny business. This is significantly advantageous for PLTR for the business that it is in and the groupthink prevalent among tech workers.

They still don't have any direct competitor(not that I know of) and will have a revenue of $1B+ whereas their total addressable market size is $120B(somewhere near that ballpark, I read the SEC filings when they IPOed, but forgot the numbers and since they are building more and more products could increase TAM further).

Their software is infinitely adjustable and boy have you seen their customer retention and horizontal growth rate when they make a company Palantir's customer.

If you go to their Investors Relations website, you will see the numerous ways they are helping clients. One example, an oil major would save $1B annually for using Palantir's software.

They have an almost 10+ years head start in the business and the fact that it’s so deeply entrenched with the government means it ain't gonna become bankrupt.

I mean this shit can surpass NFLX or TSLA valuations if Karp's vision and various statements are realised.

Also remember, Peter Thiel and Alex Karp do not just work for money, they already have had a boatload(literally) of money and for them to stick to a product for nearly 17 years is definitely telling.

This company probably wouldn’t enter the Chinese market or more likely wouldn’t take any Chinese government contract.

Their margins are insane(forget NFLX, AAPL, TSLA etc) when their customers enter the scaling phase and their products are sticky as hell.

Short term considerations:
There's around 80% shares that COULD be unloaded in the market in the near future in 2021(again I forgot the exact date), surrounding this event, there could be significant price volatility, but we all know no one's mad enough to suddenly sell 80% of the shares.

Regardless, a lot of employees could exercise options constantly that they received as compensations as they didn’t get the chance to do so earlier at a fair price.

They raised their guidance. And do you know what market loves the most? Raised guidance. That's why even though market sold off by retail profit takers at first then it quickly went back to where it was. Monday could be higher.

This stock probably hasn’t really discovered its true pricing because of the still low institutional ownership and employees stock options activity.

The market(by market I mean some journos and analysts) still seems to misunderstand their product and think they are a data mining company, a consultant company, a fancy government contractor for specialist software etc. It is not any of them. I will let you discover yourself what this company is. It's kind of like how some boomer analysts still think a certain company is just a car company.

How to play this shit?
I think leaps or outright buying shares(then selling puts to generate income and buy more) is the best way, regardless, this is a matter I don't want to comment too much, I have given you some insight, now you do your own thing.

Remember, this isn’t NIO, it’s a much more bigger fish than that(if they can realise their long term goals).

Some resources for you to dive slightly deep.

Calls on GME. $100c Jan 1 expiry. The SHORT SQUEEZE is coming! Forget NIO and other CCP stocks. Stick to American names you can trust, like ENRON, NKLA, and GME!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ How I feel when commenting on r/investing, enjoy all you other drunks. _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ If WSB is a casino, you should probably build a strategy. Here is my perspective. TL;DR it takes too much work and mental stress to become consistently profitable. Get a day job.             

Below are some of the guidelines I make for my own personal investments and I am sharing my investing perspective so it may help others improve their trading views through the perspective of an idiot.         

What I think every investor should know/learn about:         

•It usually takes years before traders become profitable, but it can be a great source of income if you can game the market.        

•It is important to remember that there is always a winner and a loser in a trade. The banks are usually the winners.       

•When you go to the casino always find a way to bet on the casino winning.       

•Only sell puts when they are covered and you intend to buy stocks from it to use as a potential swing trade or long hold. You don’t want to get caught trying to work the verticals after hours.              

•Indicators are great outliers for trading, but should really only be used as a basis to judge your trades at the end of the day. you want to avoid getting VWAP, MACD and IC fucked because when you’re trading at the bottom of the channels sometimes it just keeps going...         

•Sitting back and going cash heavy is never a bad move. Sure you miss out on some opportunities but you certainly don’t want to feel the bite of overbuying during an institutional sell off.          

•Consolidation can take weeks before it rockets or blows up. Place consolidation calls 1 month out and swings 2 weeks out. Theta usually burns during the last week more than any other time, so doing 2 week trades is usually best unless you expect the market to turn the next day(don’t buy calls for next Friday exp if tomorrow is the only up day you expect) because other people are probably thinking the same thing and selling their options at the same time as you.           

•Generally speaking, most people lose money by buying a call or put and holding it until expiration. If you’re lucky enough to ride a daily wave or gap consider selling out or pulling profits to gamble with house money. How many degenerates have been up 100+ only to be down 90% the next day?         

•Know the rules(really though, read the rules on exercising options as they vary from platform to platform).      

•make your own guidelines, and look for keys or tell tale signs of a head fake.        

•If you’re new to trading stocks you should probably stick to trading stocks until you learn what a bid/ask spread is, learn how markets move, and learn how all the small things can make industries move on a macro level.          

•Learn how to time the market and compare charts for consistent moves made during specific time periods. Break it down per 1,5,15,30,60 minute charts and daily charts mon-Friday for years. Try to find tendencies and consistencies in charts and graphs. If you think you can read charts and patterns choose a random day of that stock that you have not studied and day trade it using Webull on normal time playback(not on fast forward so you suffer the misery of watching it move slowly for minutes on end only to miss the timing of the jump or bottom).          

•There is nothing wrong with holding onto cash and just watching/studying the markets. Look for how different things like hurricanes, war, tsunamis, inflation, deflation, bond yields and exchange rates effect the market in the mean time as that is what has been driving this market on a macro level.       

•my personal holdings strategy is 80% cash, 10% stock, 9% options and 1% leverage. It can change to 90% cash and 10% options with a 5-5 or 8-2 split when I am not holding onto stock and run bearish. I do not want a normal market as that would kill my strategy(a market that lacks volatility).      

•If leverage is too expensive to buy on your positions, find a stock that has been outperforming based on that sector and short it(assuming you’re call heavy). They usually have the lowest IV but the largest amount of movement. Puts on triple leveraged is also a pretty decent money mAker when looking for leverage(costs more but has a tendency of having larger payout percentages).        

•Learn about psychological manipulation and the way institutional investors move the bid/ask spread to create artificial support and resistance lines before canceling their buy/sell orders and letting the stock run. Sometimes they will kill the price after a few minutes just to create a different bid/ask spread with backup orders(my theory is that this is what creates VWAP and MACD flops on a macro level).         

•create your own rules that will help you refine your investments. Having too many rules doesn’t limit your trades, rather it increases your ability to invest by increasing success and through this creating confidence required to make the right trade.        

•Look at daily bond yields and volumes of bonds bought/sold and at what prices.      

•Watch currency exchanges as currency rates will clearly make a difference in profits that rely on imports/exports(almost every company).     

•When trading wedges, sell out when one set of options covers the cost of the entire wedge(calls and puts) +10%, and hold the other side until the stock goes the other way. I view it as buying the consolidation, profiting off of movement, and banking off of a head fake.       

•sell options within the first 15-30 minutes of market open if the stock spiked to take advantage of volatility.       

•buy options around 2-3et as that will usually be the cheapest time , but the last half hour can also be a great time depending on which part of charts you like to work.        

•Close options as a day trade if I profit 100% or more in a day.        

Personal rules:        

80% cash, 10% stock, 10% options with 90% cash-10% options if I am bearish.       

Don’t overpay for an option just because you think you can scalp a quick 50%. It’s not worth getting macd or vwap fucked.        

If you have to pay more than the price of 1 stock for a weekly option that is 50 cents or .2% otm it is not worth buying in my opinion(don’t hold options for more than 1-3 days at the most because you don’t want to ride the waves if you know a down day is coming).       

Be happy with 5-10% returns. Sure some people might be making more, but you just need to hit the right rotation to outperform them.        

Do your research. Don’t jump on hype/meme stock.       

Inverse Cramer except when he is giving advice to service members.       

Always buy leverage because breaking even on bad days is worth sacrificing 10-30% worth of gains to make sure you break even if the market turns.       

Know the who(who is the ceo and what have they done), the what(what does the company sell and who are they marketed towards), when(when do you plan on buying and selling), where(where are they based out of), why(why do you think this company will outperform the other companies in the same sector), and how(how did you hear about the stock? Sources matter as they will give you an idea of how accurate they have been in the past).         

Buy on bad news and sell on good news. Most of the time billionaires already got the news and sold out by the time you hear about it and panic(causing more panic and a great buying opportunity).

I feel kinda old and dusty.

Woke up around 12pm, skipped breakfast and spent most of the day watching YouTube videos in my appartment, waiting for friends and family members to call me as they usuaully do to wish me a happy b-day.


While the whole ordeal seems sad and depressing, well, I dont give a fuck to be honest, since COVID a lot of people have probably spent their birthdays and celebrations alone, disconnected from others. I'm still happy I have relatives to call me and remember I exist, some pees dont even have that.



Also, I'm still quite happy from the 4k$ gains I made on NIO and XPEV Friday.


I made money both on their stock and options value.



Basically for the first time ever I got to sell a stock right at the peak before it came crashing down (sold NIO when it reached 53-ish).


Hell, Im acting up hot and all but I might lose everything again this week, who knows..😒


Anyway, to break up the loneliness, I contacted a hooker and booked with her since Id just made some disposable money and money buys you copes.


Wont go into detail but she basically scammed me;
she did not look like the pictures


sucked me with a condom on,


promised 2 rounds but only gave me 1


did not have a COVID testing machine (lol im joking)



But honestly, she was decently pretty, had a nice warm ploop and had big tits so for 160$, it wasnt so bad I guess.


She was a bargain ''cheap'' hookers, working 2 jobs to pay their bill. We still had a really nice convo after the sex.

Anyway, what really made me laugh is that when I got into her rundown appartment, the whole place was a mess, but there was this big flat screen on her desk with a bunch of graphs and stock overview. I did a snarky remark on it and found it even funniy that it was one of those Premiums Expansive Broker (those who have a bunch a of Charts, Statistics, Data Analysis and the pitch Black Screen for background).

Basically, the point of this thread is just to show you that bascially, everyone; EVERYONE and their moms are trading now, no matter their class, education level...its really funny, a decade ago, this was simply not a thing and I think with COVID and a bunch of Millenials hyping stocks left and right and easy access to Brokerage platform, (day) trading will become a serious democratized thing in the future. There is still a good possibility that Stocks will rise and fall in the same manner even after the pandemic since most people (day) trade in idiotic ways.

Eventually I chime in and remind him its a Chinese company and they are running negative cash flow on their books and was he not around for lukin shit show (mostly just trying to save some of these people from going in on the word of a dude on a company they havent even looked at)... guy is relentless with his hard on for NIO literally watch one of the BDC girls download robinhood to start trying to get into it. Personally I think NIO is going to take a huge dump on earnings but I dont have a dog in the fight so havent been watching to closely, oh as a bonus tried to discuss with the guy what his greeks were like on the calls but I dont think he even understood what I meant as he always kinda deflected.

They’re coming off their first quarter selling the new RTXs (which have been selling out the moment they drop). These things are butter and will continue to sell like hot cakes into the holidays. 

Their cloud computing software and AI technology is cutting edge and being used across many cloud based systems and is used by large companies like Square and Tencent. Jarvis is a mother fuckin G. If you don’t know about their AI software, look into it, it’ll make your tiny PP wet.

The median price target by analysts is $590 ($58 higher than they were at close as of Friday) with multiple price targets of $700~ and after this earnings we could see several more raises and an array of bullish sentiment. 

Lastly, CEO Leather Jacket Man Jensen delivers and every time he talks, magic happens. Wall Street loves him, the vision, the products, and the company as a whole, so why shouldn’t you?

I'm sure most of you are aware of Alibaba ($BABA) - currently, the largest Chinese company, the Amazon of China and the NIO of e-commerce. Recently, Alibaba, along with JD.com hit record sales numbers from the Singles Day event, but despite that, $BABA's share prices plummeted due to 3 reasons: PFE's vaccine news, Ant Groups' fail IPO and China's new anti-monopoly rules. These events sent $BABA's share price from near $315 levels down to $266 in just a few days - then slowly sliding it down to $260/share (-21% drop). What was it that the investors were so fearful of which triggered this downward slide?

1. Alibaba holds a \~33% stake in Ant Group, a fintech company (largest in the world - even bigger than Stripe), was set to IPO with a $313b USD valuation. This would be very beneficial for Alibaba and the multitude of enterprises that Alibaba has stake in. Unfortunately, this move was stopped by China due to a few reasons: lack of regulation and the possible increase in monopolistic competition. Hence, they drafted some monopoly regulations for review.
2. What are these monopoly regulations and the proposals thought out by the regulators? The regulators claimed that the e-commerce market is fierce and it was merely a few products that dominate the e-commerce platforms. As a result, they believe that 1 supplier per platform would be appropriate to allow for more entrants into the market.

However, it wasn't just Alibaba who was hit with this monopoly rule. Other big players like Tencent, [JD.com](https://JD.com), Meituan and Pinduoduo were hit by these waves, but their stock prices quickly rebounded (some unphased) after the fears were quickly wiped off.

While $BABA still seems to be a sinking ship after the news.

[BABA](https://preview.redd.it/bs7xv52ifbz51.png?width=688&format=png&auto=webp&s=6da96f6d51ff15a203318d9531c9d6748567afa6)

Guys, $BABA at these levels is a steal. This is a monster of a company that only has great outlooks for the future. I personally believe that these monopolies laws might not come into fruition because it would be incredibly difficult to provision 1 supplier per platform rule with so many merchandisers out there. One may argue that even if it does get drafted, it just means a weaker barrier to entry, so more companies will be able to bring in new products to compete against the *better* brands; thus, increasing quality, competition and customer acquisition and retention. Regulation = bearish - doesn't always equate.

Some more info about BABA for you value investors out there:

BABA's PER = 28.02, EPS (TTM) = 9.31, 717.383B MC

AMZN's PER = 91.48, EPS (TTM) = 34.20, 1.57T MC

JD's PER = 626.39, EPS (TTM) = 0.15, 139.745B MC

BABA is incredibly underpriced.

Also, I did mention this in the beginning, but what was it that I witnessed that made me enter this position? $BABA was red the entire day on Friday, bottomed at -2.5% then closed at -1.3%. It didn't see green even once. Despite that, their OTM option prices strangely rose by a lot.

The IVs on these average at around 65%, but currently they sit at 40%. Probably the near the bottom which signals for a great entry.

The fear levels were extremely high on Friday, and China will keep their ears open for public's opinion until Nov 30, so it still might be a dangerous time to enter. But I just couldn't resist after seeing those types of option activities. Fear levels dying down over the weekend and JD's earnings report that's being released this coming Monday might also show a gap up starting Monday.

Don't take this to be financial advice, but my forecast for $BABA is at least back to $310 levels before 02/19/20. You also have $BABA's earnings coming up in the 2nd week of Feb, so the IV will be insanely high this time to increase the value of your contracts even more.

Given the market (especially tech) rally that followed, and the current near ATH’s of SPY, a lot of retail traders and analysts thought that they made a crazy amount of money. Including myself. 

SoftBank finally released the veil on how they performed, and the results are the opposite of what everybody expected. 

[“SoftBank racks up $3.7bn in losses at tech stock trading unit”. ](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.ft.com/content/0edb7c17-58e6-4ded-acfa-1822440a926c) 

How!?! Their tech calls should’ve printed. HARD. 
The only explanation I can think of it that they didn’t take profit and either they panic sold when SPY crashed weeks ago or theta ate away their profits. 

Such a huge loss when they were, on paper, on the right side of the bet is mind boggling. 
I’d appreciate it if someone could shed some light on this topic._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ NIO has a gap full to $28. Please, for the love of God, stay away from NIO. This is the last time i’m talking about NIO. 

When these short attacks happen they do not last for JUST ONE DAY. I’ve seen this happen so many times.

There are so many plays right now. U looks like it’s on track to hit $130 or more. If SEDG drops about another $10-$15 it will set up for another run. If PTON hits the low 90’s it will go parabolic. PLEASE find a different play. You guys don’t need to buy calls on a stock that’s being shorted through the middle of the fucking Earth.

&#x200B;

I believe yesterday, I checked out [https://unusualvolume.info/](https://unusualvolume.info/) and I checked out MTG.

&#x200B;

MTG is the stock ticker for (MCIC) Mortgage Guarantee Insurance Corporation.  [Mortgage Guarantee Insurance Corp. (MTG) co. website](http://mtg.mgic.com/news-releases/news-release-details/mgic-investment-corporation-reports-third-quarter-2020-results)This company provides financial products for Mortgage Investors. They protect Mortgage investors from credit losses. Looking at their quarterly financial reports they have appeared to be taking losses. However, throughout 2018, 2019, and 2020 they have maintained a consistent growth rate.

&#x200B;

Your question will be like: "So why should I buy calls on this company?"

My answer is because of RKT. Throughout the Pandemic RKT has raked in a shit ton of money. People have been applying for mortgages from RKT to take advantage of low-interest rate mortgages. [RKT record loan volume.](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/11/rocket-companies-ceo-tech-investments-drove-record-loan-volume-in-q3.html) this link shows the record amount of mortgages people have been applied for.  Now, If you have watched the Big Short which is mandatory for this sub, With new mortgages, come new Mortgage-Backed securities. Why shouldn't investors buy CDS or credit protection from MTG, when they offer them?  With this kind of info, and with the unusual options activity... I'm going to buy calls on it on Monday.

Excerpt from [Amendments to Regulation SHO (Release 34-61595)](http://www.sec.gov/rules/final/2010/34-61595.pdf):

>By not allowing short sellers to sell at or below the current national best bid while the circuit breaker is in effect, the short sale price test restriction in Rule 201 will allow long sellers, who will be able to sell at the bid, to sell first in a declining market for a particular security. As the Commission has noted previously in connection with short sale price test restrictions, a goal of such restrictions is to allow long sellers to sell first in a declining market.   
>  
>A short seller that is seeking to profit quickly from accelerated, downward market moves may find it advantageous to be able to short sell at the current national best bid. In addition, by making such bids accessible only by long sellers when a security’s price is undergoing significant downward price pressure, Rule 201 will help to facilitate and maintain stability in the markets and help ensure that they function efficiently. It will also help restore investor confidence during times of substantial uncertainty because, once the circuit breaker has been triggered for a particular security, long sellers will have preferred access to bids for the security, and the security’s continued price decline will more likely be due to long selling and the underlying fundamentals of the issuer, rather than to other factors.   
>  
>In addition, combining the alternative uptick rule with a circuit breaker will strike the appropriate balance between our goal of preventing short selling, including potentially manipulative or abusive short selling, from being used as a tool to exacerbate a declining market in a security and the need to allow for the continued smooth functioning of the markets, including the provision of liquidity and price efficiency in the markets. The circuit breaker approach of Rule 201 will help benefit the market for a particular security by allowing participants, when a security is undergoing a significant intra-day price decline, an opportunity to re-evaluate circumstances and respond to volatility in that security. We also believe that a circuit breaker will better target short selling that may be related to potential bear raids and other forms of manipulation that may be used to exacerbate a price decline in a covered security. At the same time, however, we recognize the benefits to the market of legitimate short selling, such as the provision of liquidity and price efficiency. Thus, by imposing a short sale price test restriction only when an individual security is undergoing significant downward price pressure, the short sale price test restrictions of Rule 201 will apply to a limited number of securities, rather than to all securities all the time. 

On Friday, November 13, NIO's share price was artificially driven down by short sellers on Friday through the tactic of unrelentingly selling at lower and lower bids. The alternative uptick rule was applied to NIO after the share price declined 10% of the previous trading day's closing price. The short sale related circuit breaker was triggered at 14:05:03. This rule prevents short sellers to sell at or below the current national best bid. 

We have reason to believe NIO will continue to trade at higher prices throughout earnings week based on the number of positions added and new positions entered by investors on Friday alone: [https://fintel.io/sob/us/nio](https://fintel.io/sob/us/nio). The duration of price test reduction starts at the trigger point of the circuit breaker and ends when markets close the following trading day. In this case, it will end after markets close on Monday. Short sellers must be prepared for a scramble to cover their positions or they will be at risk of unlimited loss.

View daily trending tickers on r/RedditTickers._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Marijuana = Green = Gains: APHA Calls will print. Alright, first off this is going to be the most intensive DD I have ever done. By this I mean I actually googled stuff and looked at charts. 

APHA is a Canadian weed company. Here are their financials: 

https://aphriainc.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/aphria-Q1-2021-consolidated-financial-statements.pdf

 Who gives a shit about Canada, right? Not the stock market anymore that's for sure, this isn't 2017. You know that, I know that, we all know that. 

But here's the thing: *APHA* knows that. APHA sees that juicy fat booty that is the potential US market, and APHA doesn't seem to be sitting around with its dick up its ass waiting to see "legislation"  or some other nerd bullshit no one cares about before they make their move.

Throwing their proverbial knit beanie into the ring, APHA acquired U.S. based SweetWater Brewery this past month:

[Aphria Inc. Announces Strategic Entry into the United States with an Agreement to Acquire SweetWater Brewing Company](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/aphria-inc-announces-strategic-entry-into-the-united-states-with-an-agreement-to-acquire-sweetwater-brewing-company-301166616.html)

What does SweetWater make? Obviously they make fucking beer. It's a brewery. 

So what's the big deal you ask? SweetWater is about *branding* and *distribution*.

>SweetWater's Portfolio of Beer Brands, Including the Flagship 420 Brand, Aligns with a Cannabis Lifestyle and Provides a Scalable Platform for Expansion into the U.S. and Canada

>Establishes an Infrastructure in the U.S. Enabling Accelerated Entry into U.S. Cannabis Market, Subject to Federal Legalization

What type of name recognition does SweetWater have among APHA's target demographic? 

Well, not only are they a decently successful brewery in their own right, they [*host a big fucking stoner music festival every year*](https://www.sweetwater420fest.com/). Artists like **Snoop Dogg**, Widespread Panic, The Avett Brothers, Rebelution, Joe Russo's Almost dead, etc. 

Here's the APHA CEO on the acquisition's merits:

>Our strong balance sheet and access to capital have enabled us to enter the U.S. through this strategic and accretive acquisition. We will establish and grow our U.S. presence through SweetWater's robust, profitable platform of craft brewing innovation, manufacturing, marketing and distribution expertise. At the same time, we will build brand awareness for our adult-use cannabis brands, Broken Coast, Good Supply, Riff and Solei, through our participation in the growing $29 billion craft brew market in the U.S. ahead of potential future state or federal cannabis legalization," said Irwin D. Simon, Aphria's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "We look forward to building upon the strengths of each of our respective and complementary brands, diversifying our product offering, broadening our consumer reach, and enhancing loyalty with consumers." 

**Now listen, obviously this acquisition isn't the reason I'm writing this DD.**  

This acquisition isn't some golden goose, it's just enough to have gotten *more attention on this stock*. 


Let's take a quick look at APHA's charts:

https://imgur.com/gallery/9tuU16O?nc=1

As you can see on their YTD, they're back at their 52 week high. I believe this momentum is going to continue through the inauguration. Their chart appears to form a Cup and Handle Pattern on the 3 Month. They also have a "Golden Cross" but that wasn't exactly recent, although the bullish trend *has* panned out since it occured.

*Options are cheap, cheap, cheap, and oh boy do we have catalysts.* 

APHA has a very *very* interesting date for earnings. They will report on *January 14th.* One week prior to inauguration day. And wouldn't luck have it, there are options that expire on 1/15.

I believe that the combination of these two events will cause a brief rally in APHAs stock. I don't know how how high it would go, but it wouldn't need to go up much to make huge gains with calls. 

**Positions**: I currently hold 91 contracts of 1/15 10c and 10 of 1/15 20c (just lotto tickets, *probably* don't buy the 20cs lol). I plan on doubling down on my 1/15 10c position on Monday.

**There is substantial open interest in this position, which makes me think someone in the know is making this bet as well.**

 Open interest currently sits at 31.4k. The 7.5cs on the same date have an open interest of 27k.

Edit: To clarify **I don't *really* expect the stock to hit 10.** If it does then, wow, but this is a momentum play._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ The Market Wizards: Beat the Market with These 9 Weird Tricks! The following is an excerpt from [The Market Wizards](http://optionboost.com/Market_Wizards.pdf):

There is no holy grail to trading success. The methodologies employed by the "market wizards" cover the entire spectrum from purely technical to purely fundamental—and everything in between. The length of time they typically hold a trade ranges from minutes to years. Although the styles of the traders are very different, many common denominators were evident: 

1. All those interviewed had a driving desire to become successful traders—in many cases, overcoming significant obstacles to reach their goal. 

2. All reflected confidence that they could continue to win over the long run. Almost invariably, they considered their own trading as the best and safest investment for their money. 

3. Each trader had found a methodology that worked for him and remained true to that approach. It is significant that discipline was the word most frequently mentioned. 

4. The top traders take their trading very seriously; most devote a substantial amount of their waking hours to market analysis and trading strategy. 

5. Rigid risk control is one of the key elements in the trading strategy of virtually all those interviewed. 

6. In a variety of ways, many of the traders stressed the importance of having the patience to wait for the right trading opportunity to present itself. 

7. The importance of acting independent of the crowd was a frequently emphasized point. 

8. All the top traders understand that losing is part of the game. 

9. They all love what they are doing.

TLDR: [The Market Wizards](http://optionboost.com/Market_Wizards.pdf) is a great read.

I’m 18 years old, I bought 30k worth of CfD shares on leverage for Village Farms (VFF) at $6.40 on mad leverage. I was hoping for good earnings. 

I thought we got good earnings, but it dropped two and a half percent. I’ve had to top up my account 5 times to stop positions closing.

It’s my birthday on Monday and I don’t think my parents would be happy if they lost their only child.

Please buy, it has a super low float. If all 1.5 million of us muster together we can get some FDs and some birthday coke and hookers; and the happiest boy in the world.

I know /r/stocks is retard, but check this dudes post to justify my title: [https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/5u09c2/aes\_corp\_renewable\_energy\_storage/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/5u09c2/aes_corp_renewable_energy_storage/)

SIX (three) years ago, this guy had tsla, said it was not just a car company. But see, how he says AES does the same thing and isnt getting as much hype?

I'm not saying AES will go to $1000, but I think it deserves a $23 price target, the one morgan issued BEFORE earnings. If they issue a new, higher one, AES has a chance of moving even further.

[Heres a random picture for the retards who dont want to read, dont know how to read, are retarded.](https://preview.redd.it/q2h0vvskjaz51.png?width=303&format=png&auto=webp&s=69e013c001c457fbc7da63be40455828d66f1619)

Furthermore, AES has had massive call buying, if you check CVS, FISV, they had the same and ended up breaking out to the upside. Now, I'm no technical analyst, but AES is EXACTLY at its pre-covid highs, and just check the options chain for yourself on yahoo, or barchart. The volume and open interest is OUTSTANDING.

There is a serious chance for this stock to break out, wallstreet is waiting for a break to $23 based on the options. I have $1800 on the company!!! I can post screenshots if u really want. this is not a pump and dumb, tis is LEGIT DD!

**TLDR**: **read the stocks link post i gave, do you**r own DD, check analyst price targets in thinkorswim and compare how morgan price targets have risen and actually changed and accurately predicted price.

current price target from morgan is $23, calls that are crazy is like 22k in nov 20 (WEEKLY NOW!! WOW) $22 and 22k in dec 18 $22. So this option buyer predicts $22 AT LEAST?

&#x200B;

hmmmm?? you do the math boys. remember FISV and CVS, CVS had hard bottom support for so long between $55-60 and then came back to $70 after earnings. FISV had been in $95-$102 channel for MONTHS, easily swing trading calls at each bottom, now after its earnings, biden win and vaccine news it broke on monday out of the range super super. all of these stocks had this same options activity, massive call buying, no puts rly, juts calls crazy all rolling out every month too._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ 20 Days till everyone's money rotates back into Tesla for 5500%+ Gains? Before everyone says this is a pump and dump, I'm offering two different scenarios.

S&P inclusion is the one of the only things that can pull tsla's SP out of the trading pattern that it's in.  For the most part, them crushing earnings and deliveries, fsd beta, etc is just them being themselves which is what everyone expects from them.  IE: Priced in. (disclaimer, I'm about 90% tsla)

We had the run up for q2 s&p inclusion, wolf was cried.  Didn't happen.  People will say/think ah, just another time that it won't happen.  If that's what happens then we have a play for that.  If the stock actually runs up, we sell the news.

IV is extremely low right now so options are cheap

Volume 3 days prior will be a big indicator too for if inclusion is happening, just have to subtract the fomo volume to see if it's real index funds purchasing permanently

12/4 is the magic date that's 2 weeks before inclusion

1.  Get into tsla in whatever form you want.  Shares, calls dated 12/11 or later, leaps, etc.

2a. Stock runs up, IV spikes, sell ALL prior to 12/4.  Take profit

3a. Stock tanks on no inclusion, pile back in on the massive drop.  Do what you will after that

3b. Inclusion happens but you sold everything, FOMO back in ASAP.  The run up should continue at least past the first 5 minutes of Monday.  It'll probably gap up 20-30%, doesn't matter.  Get in.  Do what you will after

2b. Stock does nothing at all, IV stays flat, everything trades sideways.  Sell a portion of your tsla holdings and yolo into some deep otm calls.  If today is 12/4 and iv was exactly the same, you can get some 550c for 18 cents for one week out which is inclusive of the whole index rebalancing plus time since you buy at almost close, and have the option to sell immediately on gap up or hold for more gains trading for time decay.

&#x200B;

TLDR

Buy TSLA Calls/Shares/LEAPs

Sell after run up close to 12/4

or

If no run up, YOLO some 12/11 550C (only 18 cents per share at current IV for 1 week out)

&#x200B;

If IV stays perfectly low and you yolo 12/11 550C, and it goes ITM at open, 5500% gains.  JUST based on it gapping up.  It'll be worth much more because the IV should spike extremely hard. 

18 cents to $10 or more, PLUS IV price increase_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ MU, the number one OG meme stock is coming back. Biggest reason MU took a nosedive is because of bad relations between Trump and China (trade war). But, now that Biden is going to be the president (probably) those relations are probably going to get better. I’m thinking that MU will hit $70 by EOY. 

So MU Dec, 55 puts?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_
