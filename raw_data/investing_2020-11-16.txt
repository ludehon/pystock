It took me a couple of years to get there, but I think I've finally landed on good investment philosophy/strategy.

I've realised that all of my biggest investing losses have been when I didn't know much about the company I was buying and the market it was in. Or when I tried to time the market and buy/sell at certain times. My biggest wins have come from buying companies that I understand really well and holding them for longer.

I work at a large enterprise tech company, so for me this means focusing on other enterprise software companies. I often get exposure to these companies because I use their products at work. This helps me to get a far better understanding of their likelihood of future success. I also plan to hold each investment I make for a minimum of 5 years. (Ideally 10+ years).

There's nothing novel about this approach. Buffet calls it focusing on your "circle of competence". But sometimes, you need to come to the same conclusion through your own direct experience.

"During the third quarter, the holding company revealed new stakes in big pharmaceutical names like AbbVie, Bristol Myers Squibb, Merck, and Pfizer — one of the major companies pioneering a COVID-19 vaccine.

According to a 13-F regulatory filing, Berkshire snapped up approximately 21.2 million shares of AbbVie (ABBV), a stake valued near $2.09 billion based on Monday’s closing price. Berkshire also purchased 29.9 million shares of Bristol Myers Squibb (BMY), 22.4 million shares of Merck (MRK), and 3.7 million Pfizer (PFE) shares during the quarter, the filing shows.

Separately, the company boosted its stakes in Bank of America (BAC), General Motors (GM), and Kroger (KR). Berkshire added 3.7 million shares to its Bank of America position, to last hold 1.03 billion shares, a stake valued at $28.48 billion, the second-largest stock position in the portfolio.

Berkshire also purchased shares of Snowflake (SNOW) during the quarter in a private placement. At the quarter’s end, Berkshire held nearly 6.13 million shares, a position valued at around $1.48 billion based on Monday’s closing share price.

During the quarter, Berkshire Hathaway exited its position in Costco (COST) — selling its remaining 4.3 million shares during the period, while trimming its positions in Wells Fargo (WFC), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), PNC Financial Services, and M&T Bank. Berkshire slashed its Wells Fargo stake by nearly 46%, selling 110.2 million shares, to last hold 127.38 million shares.

Berkshire also trimmed its position in Barrick Gold to last hold 12 million shares as of Sept. 30. Berkshire Hathaway snapped up approximately 20.9 million shares of Barrick Gold (GOLD) in the second quarter."

Please be kind, my ignorance isn‘t willful. 

I have some money saved that I don‘t want to have sitting in the bank account anymore. I understand enough to know to disperse it, I‘m thinking 60% ETFs, and I’ll put around 10% into precious metals and let my dad‘s manage it because he’s had quite some success with that over the last 10 years. 

I‘m thinking of putting the remaining 30% into clean tech. I‘d like to think it‘s not out of conviction, but rather based on the facts that 
a) the world needs it and policy makers are doubling down on it (driven by a combination of conviction, necessity, opportunism and prestige);
b) PV, wind and batteries are killer technologies, taking over the power and transport sectors right now, with heating just around the corner and industry not far away;
c) I have a background in engineering and work in public policy, and while my knowledge of markets isn‘t on a level of a professional investor, I think I can tell what‘s hype and what‘s real in the medium to long term. 

I know investing in equipment manufacturers is traitorous and will avoid it. There‘s many Nikolas for each Tesla, and then there‘s China that‘ll price out every competitor that can be Commoditized. Automotive and highly specialized equipment are only industry that I can think of where Western companies seem able to stay ahead in the mid to long term. Plus, we’ve seen a lot of self-inflicted pain in Europe. PV has gone through a boom followed by a bust here, and Wind isn‘t tearing it everywhere either at the moment despite maturing, thanks to policies intended to keep it on a leash.

What I‘m observing is that the markets are changing very fast and that most companies are dragging their feet to adapt. Companies with vision, strategy and the chops to pull it off seem few and far between. Healthy ones who are not doing it out of desperation are even less common. I‘m specifically looking at power market (and to some degree, gas). With batteries, demand response, V2G/V2H, sector coupling, heating networks etc., the players able to digitize, deploy new hardware and find new business models should have potentially high rewards. sure, not all will come out on top, and there‘ll be a lot trying to piggyback on this hype or the other. same goes for highly specialized companies, both on hardware and software side of things.

I don't have much prior experience and am trying to get into the investing space. I've been trying to decide which services to subscribe to... I've looked at a couple of the well-known ones like Barron's and MarketWatch, but one of my friends strongly recommended IBD (Investor Business Daily).

How do people go about choosing which services they want to use? They seem to cover broadly the same types of info: market news, stocks to watch, analytical commentary on specific companies and industries, etc. Is there one that I should choose over the other in terms of beginner friendliness, reputation/trustworthiness, investing approach (long term investing vs short term trading)?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ My issue with heavy reliance on complex models and ebit/ebitda A lot of analysts rely heavily on one or two models they swear by to predict which stocks you should invest in. I have had to use a lot of models in case competitions and throughout college, and while on the surface they look really sophisticated and like they should be reliable, they really are just an excuse to slap whatever valuation you want onto a stock. Most of these models get so abstract with their valuations that tweaking an input or an expected result by just a few percentage points can drastically alter the final valuation, meaning a slight difference between the expectations of the future and what actually happens results in a big difference in both stock performance and earnings.

&#x200B;

Models themselves are a critical part of finance and equity research. They present a simplified picture of a company that is crucial to investors. Yet when models get too abstract and when people rely on models to tell the entire story of a company, things get hairy.

&#x200B;

On the subject, many models rely heavily on ebit and ebitda in its valuations. The issue with this is that while it makes it easier to compare companies, it hides a lot of key issues that can come up. Removing depreciation and amortization from the equation obscures companies with high capital expenditures that suck up a lot of the cash the company makes and makes them look a lot better when compared with companies who have much lower capex costs and as a result get to keep a lot more of their money and put it towards expanding operations and investing in other areas of the company. Removing interest expense from the equation gives an unfavorable advantage to companies laden with debt and high yearly interest payments when compared to companies with low debt and low payments each year. Overall, using ebit and ebitda makes crappy companies look a lot better than they actually are.

&#x200B;

Using models too often and treating them like the word of god is a bad thing, no matter how good they are. Keep in mind though, models do have an important role in company analysis, but too much of anything is bad. Additionally, ebit and ebitda are a terrible way to compare companies and models that use these a lot should generally should be avoided._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Value investing stocks/Index funds I've been reading alot recently of the argument between Value and Growth investing and wanted to further diversify my portfolio.

I’m starting to focus my ideas on investments in a post-pandemic world and believe mental illness/wellness type services will become significantly more in demand.

Companies such as Draft Kings and Penn have benefited from the projected increase in revenue. Statistically, a portion of that revenue will include new people will now need gambling addiction services. I think as gaming increases, so does the need for services associated with gaming (eventually). 

2) Reduced stigma - mental wellness is encouraged, and seeking help for mental health is more acceptable for Gen Z / Millenial than in prior generations.  Back up data points - In 2019, the top 10 meditation apps grew revenues to $195 million. Calm, which is estimated to have grossed $92 million in 2019, and Headspace, which grossed $56 million have been on the top 10 list for 5 years. Both saw revenues up year-over-year, as well, at 46% and 33% respectively. (Tech Crunch, Jan 2020).

https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-11-15/china-s-electric-vehicle-surge-excites-investors-but-look-again

A quick review of the numbers: Passenger vehicle sales rose 9.5% in October from a year earlier, and have grown every month since May. Green cars, like hybrids and pure electrics, are standouts: Sales are up more than 50%. Stock prices for companies like BYD Co. and NIO Inc. have more than doubled this year. New model launches have boosted sentiment as local automakers incline toward carbon-free. Beijing wants such cars to account for 20% of all sales by 2025.

There’s no doubt that the path is toward a greener future, where electric cars and even more expensive hydrogen-powered vehicles dominate. But here’s the reality right now. Gasoline-powered auto sales are rising, too, around 6%, with 1.9 million manufactured domestically sold in September. 1  This segment accounts for around 90% of passenger cars sold monthly in the world’s largest market, where over 20 million autos were sold last year. Sport utility vehicles and other traditional-engine models that were beginning to find favor pre-slowdown aren’t seeing a big rebound yet. 

Electric car sales – though surging – are rising from a low base and the numbers are small relative to the size of the market, with around 160,000 green autos sold in October. Commercial and passenger new energy vehicles more than doubled last month from a year earlier. However, for the 10-month period, they fell 7.6% to around 875,000. That’s partly because some government subsidies were withdrawn or made harder to get last year. Penetration remains low, at around 6%, according to Jefferies Group LLC analysts.

In recent months, Beijing has released incentives to ease the purchase and financing of electric vehicles for fleets, leading to a faster uptake. Production volumes are up – 70% or 167,000 cars in October, but that’s still down 9% for the whole year, according to Daiwa Capital Markets Hong Kong Ltd. analysts. Battery installations tell a similar story.

Predicts a BTC price over 300K USD by end of 2021. https://www.investing.com/analysis/bitcoins-price-action-rhymes-with-1970-gold-markets-says-citibank-200544659

CitiBank MD, and former FX technician, Tom Fitzpatrick, points out distinct analogies between the 1970 gold market and Bitcoin in his latest report, “Bitcoin: 21st Century Gold.”

History of Money and Gold
The seeds of the 1970 bull market in gold were sown back in 1944. After World War II, forty-four countries signed the Bretton Wood Agreement, which shaped the global currency market until 1973.

The agreement pegged the U.S. dollar to gold and all the other currencies against the dollar. It attempted to build a regime where the U.S. dollar was equivalent to gold as a reserve currency.

And, the U.S. became quite successful in achieving this vision.

However, with global industrialization and inflation in the dollar, the preference for gold and other currencies began growing. This caused a gold rush by 1970, as people rushed to swap their bills for the precious metal. Hence, in 1971 US president Richard Nixon broke the ties between greenbacks and gold, giving birth to the fiat regime that we now know.

With a relatively free currency market, gold’s price grew enormously for the next 50 years.

The monetary inflation and devaluation of the greenback are the basis of Fitzpatricks’ comparison of Bitcoin with gold. The report reads:

“Bitcoin move happened in the aftermath of the Great Financial crisis (of 2008) which saw a new change in the monetary regime as we went to ZERO percent interest rates.”

Fitzpatrick pointed out that the first bull cycle in Bitcoin from 2011 to 2013 when it increased by 555 times resulted from this.

Currently, the COVID-19 crisis and the government’s associated monetary and fiscal response are creating a similar market environment as gold in the 1970s. Governments have made it clear that they will not shy away from unprecedented money printing until the GDP and employment numbers are back up.

The above analysis is music to the ears of any Bitcoin enthusiast. What has been oft-preached across crypto forums is finally going mainstream.

Hyberbullish Bitcoin Targets
Fitzpatrick did not stop there; his price prediction chart sees Bitcoin price at $318,000 by December 2021.

Bitcoin Price Prediction ChartBitcoin Price Prediction Chart
The four-year bull and bear cycles post 2011 and the ascending parallel channel since 2013 projects growth of 102 times from the low of $3,200 in 2018 by December 2021. It reads:

“You look at price action being much more symmetrical or so over the past seven years forming what looks like a very well defined channel giving us an up move of similar timeframe to the last rally (in 2017).”

Fitzpatrick also pegs gold at $4,000-$8,000 based on an imminent economic crisis in another report.

Therefore, in all likelihood, the targets for BTC might seem exaggerated to traditional investors. Nevertheless, the principle theory of a paradigm shift in the global currency market is not new. Economist Ray Dalio has hinted at the debasement of the dollar and a paradigm shift as well.

Bitcoin might be the missing link in the new paradigm.

Moreover, the exposure of such a target to America’s largest bank’s institutional clients is alone bullish for the market sentiments._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Question on how to calculate and forecast the contractual interest expense, amortization of debt discount, and amortization of issuance costs for Chegg.

The 2025 convertible senior notes have an fixed annual interest rate of .125%. The 2023 notes have a fixed annual interest rate of of .25%. Here is more information from Chegg's 2019 10-K form...

Please help guys. I have been stuck on this for weeks and just want to get it over with. If you need more info, let me know please. Thank you._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Strategy: Pandemic Recovery Stocks as the way to go from here? It seems to me that from here on for at least a while, the best performers with the most upside are going to be the recovery stocks- like hotels, airlines, cruises, offices, entertainment venues etc. It's not going to be the stay at home stocks anymore. Those peaked a few weeks ago. 

But this thesis seems too simple. Like it's too simple and obvious to be true. But if we do get a vaccine in a month or so and we continually get positive vaccine news every week or so, this seems to be the most logical conclusion. I mean there might be a few bumps along the road, but it seems like this is the way to go. Kind of like how during the past half year the way to go was to just put your money in big tech and stay at home stocks (and EVs). 

What do you guys think? Anyone take the opposite view?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Thoughts on COTY beauty? Coty beauty is down 60% since covid. Coty has had a series of overpaying for acquisitions and has gone through a vast amount of ceos. With  debt of 13.98 B and a debt to equity ratio of 1.62. Obviously Coty is a flawed company but they still do have lots of value. COTY was consistently paying down debt before COVID. Coty is the number one fragerence retailer globally with fragerence brands that include but are not limited to  gucci, calvin klein, balenciaga, lacoste, hugo boss, tiffany and co, etc. They have so many more fragrance brands to. They own 51% of Kylie Jenners beauty brand and 20% of kim ks beauty. They own covergirl and many other brands. They beat earnings just recently and there revenue overall has been on incline. I believe coty is flawed with the help of the new ceo come out on top. I think coty is a good stock for value investors. Thoughts?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ NIO Earnings on 11/17 I apologize if this is a silly question, but as you all most likely know, NIO is booming right now and they are releasing their Q3 earnings on 11/17. However, I’m confused on why their expected EPS is -$0.17 per share. They are selling vehicles as fast as they can make them, and the stock just keeps going up. Are analysts just low-balling this estimate, or am I just missing something huge? Thanks in advance._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ What are some quant strategies used in investment? Hello all, 

I need to conduct a quant strategy study presentation for my Investment class. Could you guys give me some recommendations with some good & easy to understand quant strategies that I can choose? It's better to have enough academic paper to support my research for the quant strategy.

Much appreciated!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ There are several recommendations online about books to read to learn investing. But is there any *program* that tells you in what order you should read them? I've found a plethora of sources regarding investing online: books on ETFs, books on options, books on stocks, books on psychology, books on history of the market, biographies of investors, books on macroeconomy, etc. I have a list of [over 100 books I've collected over the last year.](https://imgur.com/a/OeUSq4D)

But I find it hard to even begin reading one of these because I don't have a base from which to start. I may start reading one book and find terms and concepts I haven't learned yet that may appear in another book that was also recommended.

In programming there are some known "programs" that guide you through the OCW and free books that everyone recommends. For instance, [*Computer Science From The Bottom Up*](https://www.bottomupcs.com/), [*A Self-Learning, Modern Computer Science Curriculum*](https://functionalcs.github.io/curriculum/) and others offer *guidance* in how to *build up* your knowledge of the craft.

So could you recommend a guideline or at least a couple of books I should start reading in a specific order to begin learning about investing?

Thanks_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ High speed rail Just speculating here but I think any infrastructure bill/ stimulus can and should include some provisions for high speed rail investment.

With that being said I have some money to play around with, I have some energy, value stocks, aviation and REITS already... but now I’m thinking of companies that would uniquely benefit from either improving building efficiency (a big part of green infrastructure) and or these rail
Projects.

Any ideas on companies that either provide train cabs, engineering design services, tracks and suppliers?

I know some of these are or may not be us based but I am curious if anyone else thinks there may be a second renaissance in rail travel ? 

Just spitballing here, I don’t mind doing a little research or holding something for 5 years before it pays off_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Good ETFs that publish their buys/sells on a daily basis? I know ARK is revered here and it's great that they publish their daily buys/sells for their funds. MSOS, an ETF for US marijuana companies also provides daily updates. 

Before I buy/sell stocks in sectors covered by ARK, I often look at their recent trade history to see their sentiment about a certain company.

1. Are there other ETFs out there that also do this? Which ones do you follow?
