 Digital Banking will be huge for $SE - comparing market opp for them  SE is has a 98B market cap.

$SE just got the license to operate as a fully digital bank in Singapore. This is great for a number of reasons (strengthening shoppeepay) and to generating money as a bank. The data insights from one of the biggest online shopping platform giants partnered with banking can bring massive potential to the company.

Amazon only offers a creditcard, that is small compared to operating a fully digital bank. There are so many more products $SE can offer clients (mortgages, LoC, heloc). Singapore is also just the start.

ShopeePay is currently in Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines. **It is only a matter of time before $SE is able to launch a digital bank in the other countries.** Looking at the careers pay there are hiring exec level positions for SeaMoney in the Philippines.

$DHI: Such a beautiful ascending triangle play. Also a support area which is awesome. Needs to break EMA lines to show real strength, and Stoch showing divergence, and Vortex is showing life.
 
$ENBL: Rebound play, as it has bounced here before. Just needs to break the 50EMA line, and the 200EMA is your support area. Stoch is low, RSI was oversold, and VI cannot get much lower at all. Great value for a bounce.
 
$ERIC: Expensive, but perfect ascending triangle play. Once it breaks EMA lines it is will be massive. Indicators say it has room to drop still, which is fine. Could be a massive move soon.
 
$GFF: Another beautiful ascending triangle play. At support, but indicators say it may pull back but price action is what is important for this one.
 
$KTRA: Great penny stock channel. Once it breaks the 50 and 200EMA lines, it'll go crazy. Showing higher lows as well, RSI fair price. Great setup.
 
$LULU: Another beautiful ascending triangle. All Indicators say it is a great deal, and it is holding above the 200EMA. Has room to drop still, but eventually -- this will be a massive move.
 
$NGD: Simple channel up, and now a 50EMA bounce play. Stoch just reversed, RSI fair, and Vortex says good deal. 
 
$NIU: New channel play here, very good value. All indicators say it is a great value play here, and just needs to break EMA lines. 
 
$SPT: Resistance now being tested as a support; 50EMA bounce play. May drop to the channel up area, which is fine -- but for now the Stoch says it is gearing up for a move here.
 
$TAST: Channel that has higher lows over months now. Hanging above 200EMA which is great, and this channel is very strong. If it dies buy into the triangle channel and then go long.
 
$TNX: Fantastic deal here. Ascending Triangle, at support, if this breaks up gonna be fantastic.
 
$TRIL: Fantastic deal on a channel play here. Higher lows, and just has to hold above the 50EMA line. Indicators say it is tired, so it may pull back, but it is a great setup.

Thanks_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Facebook, long term hold AR/VR Hello all, first post in this sub. Have at it.


Just a opening discussion on Facebook and the future.

Tbh, most of this should be known and common knowledge. 

Regarding their recent investigation. This, IMO, is just a shakedown for an eventual fine. The Feds in this case are just asking for protection money. Reason being? Instagram and WhatsApp are key to their whole social network.  In brief terms, Facebook captures the eyes of older folk, Instagram a competitor to Snapchat / Tiktok (youth) with WhatsApp being pivoted to a payment service (akin to cashapp/Venmo).

With this, Facebook has a hold on the entire social media market, as well as being apply to profit thru ads and profit from creator content. (Think ETSY for instagram, Craigslist for Facebook ‘for sale’ and a cashapp to securely do deals.)

This should all be known. 

Now where does Oculus fit in? Facebook isn’t a hardware company?🤷‍♀️. Well, I saw a Facebook phone floated ages ago during early android boom. It obviously never took off. Too late to the game as other OSs were being squeezed out for the eventual duopoly.

Many players have tried to iterate today the next phone; smart watches, google glass etc etc, seemed nice on paper, never more than a gimmick. 

Oculus isn’t so much a diversification, but a new generation of product backed by an open blank checkbook, but why?

Facebook have bought a VR company to do portable AR/VR technology with the desire to emulate the google glass, but better, basically owning the entire mobile phone ++ market, and everyone’s eyeballs. This is key, they’ve seen Apple go from strength to strength owning an entire platform.

You can see this in their divergent approach from other VR headset makers, going wireless / cheaper / all in one. As that’s their end goal.

That’s the long game, and if it comes off, it will print.

Where do Microsoft come in? Another AR/VR investor. Currently Facebook are ignoring commercial/industry AR/VR for things like meetings /remote support / remote hardware support. This sector is accelerating quickly pushed on by lock downs. Likely don’t want to support them, despite being lucrative right now. Again, owning consumer eyeballs is their mission. Being responsible for a professional product takes A LOT of work, consumers tolerate a lot more. Microsoft are already deep in the professional market, and Teams (and other office integration) will cement that fact.

Few companies have the R+D resources to break into this market, and it looks like Apple are trying to make a car? (Why? Tesla isn’t booming because of carmaking...)

Once product hits the shelves, expect a google/Apple method of creating an entire ecosystem where they hold the keys (their preferred domain: software). Apple will be playing catch-up, google will need someone to make their hardware. I’m imaging Facebook search engine, the works. (If I’m honest, this is the REAL monopoly we should be afraid of, not Facebook / Instagram / WhatsApp, but google/Apple/Facebook platform dominance, setting their own rules for businesses trying to engage on them.)

Risks: The touted breakup, the current Apple / EPIC lawsuit. Damaging their ecosystem and making the platform holder less profitable is a RISK to Facebook. But I believe they have the resource, market cap and current profitability to buy any startup, trying to compete, out. If they are broken up, they’ll be more careful and rebuild. I doubt they will deviate from this course.

Risk2: who wants a Facebook device? You can already see the hate for requiring a Facebook account. Well if they’re the only play in town, you’re gonna FOMO people.

Side note 1: I don’t expect Facebook to make these devices, only to own the underlying technology, with a contract with OEMs to only support their OS / Firmware. Google via Android, but more possessive.

Side note 2: Regarding Microsoft, this will be a sooner AR/VR bet. I work in semi conductor, and all major OEM suppliers are pushing remote AR/VR servicing and support. Microsoft are likely to capture this market. (Consider that one semiconductor process machine that has a support contract could be 250k-1M a year, the AR/VR will be a huge part in these contracts in 5-10 years.)

>By mapping the blockchains of Bitcoin and Tether, we are able to establish that one large player on **Bitfinex uses Tether to purchase large amounts of Bitcoin when prices are falling** and following the printing of Tether. **Such price supporting activities are successful as Bitcoin prices rise following the periods of intervention.** Indeed, even 1% of the times with extreme exchange of Tether for Bitcoin have substantial aggregate price effects. The buying of Bitcoin with Tether also occurs more aggressively right below salient round‐number price thresholds where the price support might be most effective. Negative EOM price pressure on Bitcoin in months with large Tether issuance points to a month‐end need for dollar reserves for Tether, consistent with partial reserve backing. Our results are most consistent with the supply‐driven hypothesis.

But I jumped on TSLA and still bought 4 around $1600 so still in the green. Lesson here for me is I should’ve paid more focus on the growth TSLA was having and should have gone with few TSLA at $460 rather than nothing.

Would love to hear your experiences! - cheers_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Options Greeks: What you should know   The Greeks

Delta – An option’s delta is the rate of change of the price of the option with respect to its underlying security’s price. The delta of an option ranges in value from 0.0 – 1.00 for calls (0 to -1.00 for puts) and reflects the increase or decrease in the price of the option in response to a 1-point movement of the underlying asset price.  
 Used to measure the change in value of a contract from a $1 change. Also is used to measure the probability of an Option Contract Expiring “ITM” (In-The-Money). For Example, a Delta of 0.40 can be seen as a 40% chance to Expire ITM.

Gamma – An option’s Gamma is a measure of the rate of change of its delta. The gamma of an option is expressed as a percentage and reflects the change in the delta in response to a 1-point movement of the underlying stock price.  
 Measures the change in Delta from a 1$ movement in the underlying asset (stock, ETF, things like that). If the underlying moves an additional 1$ Then Delta would equal the Total of Delta + Gamma. After the First Dollar move, any additional moves in the same direction increases the value of Delta by the amount of Gamma.   
 For Example, XYZ 100 12/31/20 Call for $1.00 and has a delta of .50 and a gamma of .05.  
 The price of XYZ moves 1 dollar upwards so the new price of the contract becomes 1.50.  
 The Price of XYZ moves 1 dollar upwards again so now we add both Delta AND Gamma to find the new value. (1.00 + 0.50 = 1.50) 1.50 + (.50 + .05) = 2.05 Value now.

Theta – An option’s theta is a measurement of the option’s time decay. The theta measures the rate at which the options lose their value, specifically the time value, as the expiration date draws nearer. Generally expressed as a negative number, the theta of an option reflects the amount by which the option’s value will decrease every day.  
 For example, if your option contract is currently valued at 1.00 and you have a theta of -0.10, you will lose 0.10 worth of value off your contract every day. This number will change drastically throughout the day as will the other Greeks.

Vega – An option’s Vega is a measure of the impact of changes in the underlying volatility on the option price. Specifically, the Vega of an option expresses the change in the price of the option for every 1% change in the underlying volatility.   
 Estimates the change in premium for each 1% change in the Implied Volatility (IV). There will be higher Vega on Contracts with more time. An increase in Vega increases the cost of the contract and vice versa.

Rho – Rho measures the change in Interest rates but is rarely used since Interest rates do not move much.  
 

It is important to remember that these numbers associated with each Greek will likely change constantly throughout the life of the contract. There are other variables to consider like Implied Volatility, Volume, Open Interest, Days to Expiration (dte), the P/c Ratio, upcoming catalysts, and much more.  
 

This is a very basic run down of the Greeks. You will not learn everything about options overnight. Enjoy!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ What are some of your favorite investment online communities?

Facebook's hardware division produces Portal (video teleconferencing), Oculus Quest (Virtual Reality), and is working toward Augmented Reality glasses.

Each Oculus Quest 2 sold requires an active Facebook account to use the device, and if you delete your Facebook you lose your purchases. The Oculus Quest 2 has been reported to have a production run of 3 million units per year, and it has been backordered by a month since preorders began.

In the consumer hardware space, 3 million units per year isn't huge, but this is somewhere between 50%-100% growth on last years numbers, so it's growing fast. It isn't enough to make Facebook a major hardware producer, but is it enough to put a moat between itself and other social media companies?

**Full text:** 

 Two months ago, global investors were on the cusp of embracing a windfall from what would have been the world’s largest initial public offering. Now, returns on the hundreds of millions of dollars invested with Ant Group Co. are in jeopardy.

China ordered Ant to reexamine its fintech businesses -- spanning from wealth management to consumer credit lending and insurance -- and return to its roots as a payments service.

While the central bank’s statement on Sunday was short on specifics, it presents a serious threat to the growth and most lucrative operations of billionaire Jack Ma’s online finance empire. Regulators stopped short of asking directly for a breakup of the company, yet stressed it was important Ant “understand the necessity of overhauling its business” and told it to come up with a plan and timetable as soon as possible.

Authorities also berated Ant for sub-par corporate governance, disdain toward regulatory requirements, and engaging in regulatory arbitrage. The central bank said Ant used its dominance to exclude rivals, hurting the interests of its hundreds of millions of consumers.

Ant said in response that it will set up a special team to comply with regulators’ demands. It will maintain business operations for users, vowing not to increase prices for consumers and financial partners, while stepping up risk controls.

The Hangzhou-based firm needs to set up a separate financial holding company to comply with rules and ensure it has sufficient capital, regulators added.

Here are some of the scenarios from investors and analysts on what the restructuring could look like:

**Mild**

Optimists say regulators are merely re-asserting their right to oversee the country’s financial sector, sending a warning to the internet companies without intentions of drastic change.

Beijing could be trying to make an example out of Ma’s Ant, the largest among a raft of new but pervasive fintech platforms. Past crackdowns of this nature have dealt short-term blows to companies, leaving them mostly unscathed. Social media giant Tencent Holdings Ltd., for instance, became a prominent target of a campaign to combat gaming addiction among children in 2018. While its shares took a hit, they eventually recovered to all-time highs.

Ant’s affiliate, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., similarly regained the confidence of investors after short-run selloffs following accusations by authorities on everything from unfairly squeezing merchants to turning a blind eye to fakes on its e-commerce platform.

“I don’t think regulators are thinking of breaking up Ant, as no fintech company in China has a monopoly status,” said Zhang Kai, an analyst at market research firm Analysys Ltd. “The act is not just targeting Ant but also sending out a warning to other Chinese fintech companies.”

Some see it as an opportunity for Ant. With the industry as a whole facing tougher oversight, Ant has more resources to cope with the challenges as an industry leader, said Zhang.

**Bad**

A more troubling outcome would be if regulators moved to break up Ant Group. That would complicate the shareholder structure, and hurt the company’s fastest-growing businesses.

Valued at about $315 billion before its initial public offering was halted, Ant corralled investments from the world’s biggest funds. Among them: Warburg Pincus LLC, Carlyle Group Inc., Silver Lake Management LLC, Temasek Holdings Pte and GIC Pte.

The global investors backed the company when it was valued at about $150 billion in its last round of fundraising in 2018. A break-up would make the return on their investments uncertain, with the timeline for an IPO that was due in November now pushed into the distant future.

The government could ask Ant to spin off its more lucrative operations in wealth management, credit lending and insurance, offloading them into a financial holding company that will face tougher scrutiny.

“The emerging reality is China’s regulators are adopting similar regulation toward banks and fintech players,” said Michael Norris, research and strategy manager at Shanghai-based consultancy AgencyChina.

Ant’s payments business alone leaves much less to the imagination. While the service handled $17 trillion of transactions in one year, online payments have largely been loss-making. The two biggest mobile payments operators, Ant and Tencent, have heavily subsidized the businesses, using them as a gateway to win over users. To make money, they leveraged the payments services to cross sell products including wealth management and credit lending.

“Ant’s growth potential will be capped with the focus back onto its payments services,” said Chen Shujin, a Hong Kong-based head of China financial research at Jefferies Financial Group Inc. “On the mainland, the online payments industry is saturated and Ant’s market share pretty much reached its limit.”

**Nightmare**

The worst case scenario would be for Ant to forgo its money management, credit and insurance businesses, halting its operations in the units that service half a billion people.

Its wealth management business which includes the Yu’ebao platform that sells mutual funds and money market funds, accounted for 15% of revenue.

Credit tech, which includes Ant’s Huabei and Jiebei units, was the biggest revenue driver for the group, contributing 39% of the total in the first six months this year. It made loans to about 500 million people.

That outcome would be underpinned by the idea that China’s leaders have grown frustrated with the swagger of tech billionaires and want to teach them a lesson by killing off their businesses -- even if it means short-term pain for the economy and markets.

China’s private sector has maintained a delicate relationship with the Communist Party for decades, and has only recently been recognized as central to the nation’s future. Many commentators have attributed the recent crackdown on fintech companies to remarks Ma made at a conference in October, when he decried attempts to rein in the burgeoning field as short-sighted and outmoded.

Between them, Alibaba, Ant and Tencent commanded a combined market capitalization of nearly $2 trillion in November, surpassing state-owned behemoths such as Bank of China Ltd. as the country’s most valuable companies.

The trio have invested billions of dollars in hundreds of up-and-coming mobile and internet companies, gaining kingmaker status in the world’s largest smartphone and internet market by users.

“The Communist Party is the end-all and the be-all in China. It controls everything,” said Alex Capri, a Singapore-based research fellow at the Hinrich Foundation. “There is nothing that the Chinese Communist Party doesn’t control and anything that does appear to be gyrating out of its orbit in any way is going to get pulled back very quickly,” he said, adding “we can expect to see more of that.”_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Worthy bonds?

Any analysis/advice/feedback/comments are appreciated. I’m curious as to whether the growth in the clean energy sector will be sustainable heading into 2021. Of course a Biden administration will have its benefits, but I’m still a little hesitant that renewable energy is a more cyclical sector than the past year would indicate.   

ICLN seems like one of the best ETF’s for renewables and it’s been something I’ve been thinking about making a major investment into for a long time. Any feedback would be appreciated._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ How do I get over price-anchoring? Unlike many in this subreddit, I completely missed the investment opportunity of a lifetime in March-April. It was more to do with my greed as I was expecting the market to go even lower so that I could get my target stocks at the best price possible. Throughout the upward trajectory from May-Nov, I did not invest due to fear as I was afraid that the market will drop as soon as I got in (an experience from past investments).

Now the stocks I had in mind have at least doubled in value from their March lows. In addition, I do not see any upcoming market crashes in the near future. Logic dictates that I should get in now while I can. But there is a large part of me that is still anchored on the stock prices in March and I go into the "What if..." spiral.

Hence, I really need an advice on how to get over the price-anchoring as I am pretty sure 2-3 months down the line I am going to regret not investing now._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Are SRI/ESG ETFs a marketing stunt? Between 2018  and 2020, there has been a massive flow of money into ETFs that picks companies that meet certain ESG criterias. Within the ESG universe, you can find: ESG Selected Leaders (the top dogs), ESG without controversial weapons, ESG with low carbon footprint, etc.

What puzzles me is the following: when an investor buys an ETF, they buy on the secondary market, meaning none of the cash invested actually goes into the pockets of the companies in the index. That therefore begs the question, why are people drawn to such investment types? if the premise is to not fund these "sin" companies, then the money invested into the index doesn't actually do that. In fact weather the investor invest or not makes no difference at all to these companies.

Just wondering._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ China to leapfrog US as world's biggest economy by 2028 - think tank [Source REUTERS](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-china-economy-idUSKBN29000C)


China will overtake the United States to become the world's biggest economy in 2028, five years earlier than previously estimated due to the contrasting recoveries of the two countries from the COVID-19 pandemic, a think tank said.

"For some time, an overarching theme of global economics has been the economic and soft power struggle between the United States and China," the Centre for Economics and Business Research said in an annual report published on Saturday.

"The COVID-19 pandemic and corresponding economic fallout have certainly tipped this rivalry in China's favour."

The CEBR said China's "skilful management of the pandemic", with its strict early lockdown, and hits to long-term growth in the West meant China's relative economic performance had improved.

China looked set for average economic growth of 5.7% a year from 2021-25 before slowing to 4.5% a year from 2026-30.

While the United States was likely to have a strong post-pandemic rebound in 2021, its growth would slow to 1.9% a year between 2022 and 2024, and then to 1.6% after that.

Japan would remain the world's third-biggest economy, in dollar terms, until the early 2030s when it would be overtaken by India, pushing Germany down from fourth to fifth.

The United Kingdom, currently the fifth-biggest economy by the CEBR's measure, would slip to sixth place from 2024.

However, despite a hit in 2021 from its exit from the European Union's single market, British GDP in dollars was forecast to be 23% higher than France's by 2035, helped by Britain's lead in the increasingly important digital economy.

Europe accounted for 19% of output in the top 10 global economies in 2020 but that will fall to 12% by 2035, or lower if there is an acrimonious split between the EU and Britain, the CEBR said.

It also said the pandemic's impact on the global economy was likely to show up in higher inflation, not slower growth.

"We see an economic cycle with rising interest rates in the mid-2020s," it said, posing a challenge for governments which have borrowed massively to fund their response to the COVID-19 crisis.

"But the underlying trends that have been accelerated by this point to a greener and more tech-based world as we move into the 2030s."_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Why do I keep reading lot of comments saying "just stick to the SP500's ETF and DCA"? Hello investors,

I've been investing for some years and read lot of resources, including Reddit r/investing.

The thing is I'm always amazed when I read in every single thread the classical "hey man, just stick to the SP500 ETF and DCA".

I mean, it's obvious this people have chosen to avoid stock picking and stick to passive investing. This is actually a great way of investing praised by some of the best investors. And one I recommend some of my friends an family.

But my point is, if one has chosen to do this, why on Earth are they still reading r/investing every single day and commenting that quote every minute.

In my case, the reason why I avoided passive investing was the fact that I love researching and reading about companies, and I don't see myself without doing it.

So, why do lot passive investors keep reading & commenting all individual stock analysis posts?

PS I'm not a hater, I'm just curious why they do it. IMO they do it because they keep questioning if they really want to stick with passive investing, but I could be wrong.

PS2 sorry I'm advance for my English, it's not my first language :/

Personally, I’ve tried valuing companies from the bottom up, looking at P/E ratios and tried to revert to their mean after tough times for a stock/sector and even have used some technical analysis for entry points (though I’m still a novice at this).

Sorry if a question like this is not suitable here...

I just started investing (after doing my research and reading books) mainly into ETF's. One thing that remains unclear to me is how ETF can keep growing in value. If the S&P 500 tracks the 500 largest US companies then how can it keep on growing? I would assume that after some time a company's growth will stagnate and the total market value of the top 500 companies will roughly stay the same (or at least grow together with the inflation).

Any insight into this or things I'm overlooking would be very helpful!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ SEC Filings and what you really need to know **SEC FILINGS**

Form 8-k

This form is used to report newsworthy events to the SEC, thereby making them available to the public. Included are items such as change in management, change In the company’s name, mergers or acquisitions, bankruptcy filings, and major new product introductions or sale of a product line. A Form 8-K HAS to be filed when a member of the board of directors resign over a disagreement. The 8-K is filed within four business days of the occurrence. This form is used only by domestic issuers, foreign issuers are exempt. Although ADR’s are registered with the SEC, they too are exempt because of the underlying security of foreign issue.

Form 10-K

Most domestic public issuers must file an annual report to the SEC on FORM 10-K. This report is a comprehensive overview of the company’s business and financial condition and includes financial statements that have been audited by an independent accountant. Do not confute this with the annual report to shareholders, which also contains and audited financial information than the annual report, while the annual report will have much more detail about the company itself and its future plans.

The Filing Deadlines depend upon the company’s public float. For Companies with a float of $700million or more, the Form 10-K deadline is 60-days after the close of the fiscal year; $75 million, but not $700 million, it is 75 days; and less than $75 million is due at 90 days.

Form 10-Q

Because one year between filings is a long time and a lot can happen quickly, we also have this form, and it is filed quarterly (Q for quarterly). It contains unaudited financial statements and for all but the companies with a public float of less than $75 million, it must be filed within 40 days of each of the first three fiscal quarters of the year (no 10-Q is filed at the end of the fourth quarter—that information is taken care of by the filing of the 10-K). Those smaller firms file theirs within 45 days of the end of the quarter.

Annual Reports

When it comes to publicly traded companies, in general, all shareholders must receive a copy of the issuer’s annual report. For those too lazy to access EDGAR, this is the most detailed information they can get on the company’s financial position. Unlike the Form 10-K, this is usually a professionally prepared piece with just as much used for marketing purposes as it is for providing information. There is usually a welcoming letter from the CEO/Chairman of the board, and it is generally loaded with beautiful pictures of smiling people (employees and customers) and the company’s facilities. New plans for products and programs are discussed and voting proxies are included.

Form S-1

SEC Form S-1 is the initial registration form for new securities required by the SEC for public companies that are based in the U.S. Any security that meets the criteria must have an S-1 filing before shares can be listed on a national exchange, such as the New York Stock Exchange. Companies usually file SEC Form S-1 in anticipation of their initial public offering (IPO). Form S-1 requires companies to provide information on the planned use of capital proceeds, detail the current business model and competition and provide a brief prospectus of the planned security itself, offering price methodology and any dilution that will occur to other listed securities.

SEC Form S-1 is also known as the registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933. Additionally, the SEC requires the disclosure of any material business dealings between the company and its directors and outside counsel. Investors can view S-1 filings online to perform due diligence on new offerings prior to their issue.

Foreign issuers of securities in the U.S. don’t use SEC Form S-1 but instead must submit an SEC Form F-1.

Form S-3

SEC Form S-3 is a regulatory filing that provides simplified reporting for issuers of registered securities.

An S-3 filing is utilized when a company wishes to raise capital, usually as a secondary offering after an initial public offering has already occurred.

In order to utilize the simplified process, firms must first meet a certain set of eligibility criteria.The SEC form S-3 is sometimes filed after an initial public offering (IPO) and is generally filed concurrently with common stock or preferred stock offerings.

There are a variety of other requirements that must be met for a business to file the S-3 form. In the 12 months prior to filling out the form, a company must have met all debt and dividend requirements. The SEC Act of 1933 also requires that these forms be filed to ensure that essential facts about the business are disclosed upon the company’s registration of securities. Doing so allows the SEC to provide investors with specifics about the securities being offered and works to eliminate fraudulent sales of such securities.

Form 4

SEC Form 4: Statement of Changes in Beneficial Ownership is a document that must be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) whenever there is a material change in the holdings of company insiders. Insiders consist of directors and officers of the company, as well as any shareholders, owning 10% or more of the company's outstanding stock. The forms ask about the reporting person's relationship to the company and about purchases and sales of such equity shares.Form 4 must be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission whenever there is a material change in the holdings of company insiders .If a party fails to disclose required information on a Form 4, civil or criminal actions could result. It must be filed within two business days starting from the end of the day the material transaction occurred.

Schedule 13D

The Schedule 13D is also known as the "beneficial ownership report" and is required when any owner acquires 5% or more of the voting shares in a company. The report must be filed within 10 days of reaching the 5% threshold. It provides the following information: The acquirer's name, address and other background information, Type of relationship this owner has with the company, Whether the person has been convicted of a crime in the past five years. An explanation of why the transaction is taking place, The type and class of the security, and The origin of funds used for purchases.

Form 144

Form 144 is required when corporate insiders want to dispose of company stock. The Form 144 is a notice of the intent to sell restricted stock, typically acquired by insiders or affiliates in a transaction not involving a public offering. The stock is restricted because it must meet certain conditions before becoming transferable. The transaction, or at least part of it, is made within 90 days of filing. Form 144 is required when the amount sold during any three-month period exceeds 5,000 shares or $50,000.

Initial Public Offering (IPO)

A corporation’s first sale of common stock to the public.

Secondary Offering

A Sale of Securities in which one or more major stockholders in a company sell all or a large portion of their holdings; the underwriting proceeds ae paid to the stockholders rather than to the corporation. Typically, such an offering occurs when the founder of a business (and perhaps some of the original financial backers) determine that there is more to be gained by going public than by staying private. The offering does not increase the number of shares of stock outstanding.

Regulation D (Private placements continued.)

The provision of the Securities Act of 1933 that exempts from registration offerings sold in private placements. Rule 506(b) limits the Sale to a maximum of 35 NON-accredited investors during a 12-month period with no advertising permitted, while Rule 506(c) permits advertising but requires that all purchasers be accredited investors.  
 

Accredited Investor - As defined by Rule 501 of Regulation D, any institution or individual meeting minimum net worth requirements for the purchase of securities qualifying under the regulation d registration exemption. An individual accredited investor is generally accepted to be one who, individually or with spouse, has a net wort, excluding the net equity in the primary residence, of $1 million or more, or has had an annual income of $200,000 or more in each of the two most recent years (or $300,000 jointly with a spouse), and who has a reasonable expectation of reaching the same income level in the current year.

SEC Rule Change Effective 12/08/2020 -- Individuals who hold the Series 7, Series 65, or Series 82 Licenses, are now considered accredited investors by qualification.

There are more but these are some of the essentials to know for any active trader.  


Edit: 0 days to 40 days for 10q filing, form S-4 to Form 4, and added accredited investor information with link to EDGAR.

\- Crypto, a small percent at most
