 Avepoint - A Huge Growth Opportunity in 2021 **What is Avepoint?**

AvePoint is the largest independent software vendor of SaaS solutions to migrate, manage and protect data in Microsoft 365. They are not just a Microsoft partner, they are **THE** Microsoft Partner. They have won the *MSFT Partner Of The Year* Award 5 times.

Founded in 2001 and still growing. They have adapted to all the changes seen in software and cloud computing flawlessly. Not many companies have the pliability to adapt to market and technological innovations over the course of 20 years. There aren’t too many 20-year-old technology companies around today, especially ones that are thriving and still innovating, outside of the giant household names.

Taken from their investor presentation: [Agility and Invention](https://i.imgur.com/ThCEay8.png)

> We have consistently developed first-to-market solutions – from the days of DocAve CD-ROMs and being the first SharePoint migration vendor, to being one of the first vendors to move our solutions onto Microsoft Cloud as IaaS/PaaS and then SaaS provider, to our recent Policies and Insights SaaS product that is the first to identify, prioritize and enforce actions to prevent the exposure of sensitive information in Microsoft 365.

**Flawless Growth and Financials**

Here's the dopesauce. [There are 212 public software companies and AvePoint is one of 5 that is growing at a rate of more than 25% revenue while maintaining a higher than 10% EBIT margin.](https://i.imgur.com/QQYIpRj.png) The others in this group are ZM, RNG, NOW, TEAM. Take a quick look at the year these companies are having based on their growth and the stay at home environment. Avepoint fits this exact script.

They already have a mega client base of 7 million customers. **25% of the Fortune 500 companies use Avepoint.**

AvePoint’s 7 million customers represent a 3% share of Microsoft’s 250 million 365 users. AvePoint believes it can get to 10% share and Microsoft will hit 500 million users in the future, good for 50 million AvePoint future customers.

(TAM) Total Addressable Market: $33 billion by 2022.

They did a subscription based conversion back in 2014 and according to their CEO Dr. Tianyi (TJ) Jiang, 70% of their yearly revenue is already spoken for, leaving tremendous upside for growth. [They're already at 30%(!!!) YoY growth this year and looking to repeat that number in 2021.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD33VLw9ZOI&feature=youtu.be&t=140)

They have no debt. Cash positive with $250M in reserves. EBIT margins of 10% as mentioned. Rare qualities in the SaaS sector. The company is well over the Rule of 40 (The Rule of 40 states that, at scale, a company's revenue growth rate plus profitability margin should be equal to or greater than 40%.). Another rare quality. This company fucks. 🚀

**Valuation**

Avepoint will go public through a reverse merger with Apex Technologies in Q1 of 2021. This deal values Avepoint at $2B. In my estimation with currently market climates and demand for growth investing, Avepoint is **massively undervalued.**

A few of wall street's favorite growth SaaS company valuations:

Fastly (FSLY) - $10.6B Market Cap and $200M Revenue

Cloudflare (NET) - $25B Market Cap and $287M Revenue

Slack (WORK) - $24B Market Cap and $400M Revenue

Datadog (DDOG) - $31B Market Cap and $368M Revenue

Now compare this to Avepoint with its $2B Market Cap and $150M Revenue. There's a huge valuation discrepancy based solely on what wall street investors are willing to pay for growth companies in the tech and stay and home sector especially with COVID. Avepoint has the potential to be a 5-10 bagger.

**TL;DR** Avepoint is massively undervalued and has the potential to be a 5-10 bagger over the next year should it meet standard growth tech valuations alone. This combined with it's boosted cash on the back of going public and its already flawless financials makes it the perfect company to pocket now!

A boring grocery store wholesaler and a crazy history of fraud. TLDR:

20% margin of safety.
Full post with images (this sub doesn't allow images): https://www.reddit.com/r/UndervaluedStonks/comments/kdswr7/part_13_nasdaqwilc_with_a_20_margin_of_safety_a/


**Part (1/3) NASDAQ:WILC**

There are 3 parts to valuing this company as they have 2 other related public companies in their hierarchy and to get an overall view of the best one to buy we need to value each one.

**Background**

Willi-Food (WILC) is an Israeli supermarket wholesaler. They import food from abroad and also make in house multiple different grocery store products.

They have had a huge boost recently due to the COVID-19 pandemic and them being an essential business. Israeli's have been buying a lot more from supermarkets recently due to it and WILC revenue's recently have soared 19% YOY. This will fizzle out though now as we have a vaccine.

**Competitors**

The standard competitors are the big Israeli food supermarkets who compete with WILC for shelving space for their foods. By Israeli law the supermarkets must designate a certain amount of shelving space to other companies.

>The food law includes a temporary order to limit the shelf space of very large suppliers (defined as retailers whose annual sales exceed NIS 1 billion) to 50% of the shelf space at large stores (defined as stores with more than 250 square meters) of larger retailers. The purpose is to enable medium-sized and small suppliers, such as the Company

This is taken from the companies 10k. WILC is currently classed as a medium supplier.

WILC has sales in TTM of $446.04m NIS. So they are currently way under the threshold to become a large supplier. And because WILC is a slow grower (usually 5% growth a year apart from in COVID times) they will take some time to hit this figure (15+ years).

**Hierarchy**

Here's the hierarchy of WILC's structure of it's company. Remember this for later as it's very very important and why you should always check a companies parents and subsidiaries (especially if they are public).

Willi-Food Investments Ltd has a 62.05% stake in WILC.B.S.D Crown Ltd. has a 67.88% stake in WILC (through Willi-Food Investments).

Joseph and Zwi (Co-founders) both have a 73.48% stake in B.S.D Crown Ltd.

Willi-Food Investments Ltd is quoted on the Telaviv stock exchange under this ticker: TLV:WLFD.B.S.D Crown Ltd is quoted on the London Stock exchange under this ticker: LSE:BSD.

We will be valuing both TLV:WLFD and LSE:BSD in the follow-up posts so don't go and buy WILC just yet as there's a secret gem here.

**Co-Founders and Board History**

We cannot go further without mentioning the crazy past of WILC's history (and it's owners).As stated above BSD Crown is the company which ultimately owns WILC due to it's majority stake in the company.

In 2012 a Ukrainian corrupt oligarch called Alexander Granovsky & Gregory Gurtovoy bought a majority stake in BGI Investments. BGI investments at the time had a controlling interest in BSD Crown (which itself held a controlling interest in WILC). Mr. Granovsky then proceeded to take out a ton of dodgy loans from shady banks offering collateral from the company.

When the scandal broke he fled Israel and a bunch of people were arrested. Subsequently around 2017 (I forget the exact date) BSD Crown was taken over by the Zwi and Joseph brothers again.WILC and it's parents have had a lot of lawsuits due to this. Some of them are still outstanding but none of them are majorly impactful anymore. The Co-founders I believe are not apart of this scandal and their doesn't seem to have been anything linking them to it ever.

I believe that the market is pricing in a slight discount due to these factors.

**Relative Numbers**

- No debt
- Operating margin 14%
- ROIC 20% vs WACC 3%
- PEG  0.75, however this is inflated due to COVID so I'd say a normalized PEG of 1 is correct here.

**Absolute Numbers**

I used Aswath Damoradan's spreadsheet DCF for this.

**Value driving inputs:**

5% 1-5 yr growth rate - The growth will go back to the mean after covid is done.

9% EBIT margin - I think the margins will lower after covid and stabilize here until WILC hits 1 billion NIS sales annually (no time soon).

8 Year of convergence - The time it takes for the margins to revert from the high of 11% to 9%.

2.00 sales to cap ratio (The reinvestment effectiveness rate) - As they are a slow grower this affects the DCF very little so does not matter much.

EBIT % is the real driver of value here due to them being a slow grower.

**Cost of capital**:

0.04% Riskfree Rate - I used the israeli 10 yr gov. bond yield minus the default spread of israel.

0.52 Unlevered Beta - due to them being a grocery supplier they have little risk.

0.52 Levered Beta - due to them having no debt.

6.26% ERP - I used the Operating Country of Israel for the ERP as they are in 1 industry and pretty much just Israel.

1.63% Pre-tax Cost of Debt - I used a synthetic rating from Aswath's Sheet and got 1.63%.

3.29% Cost of Capital - Due to all of the above. This will be used as the discount rate.

**Valuation**
Images not allowed here so cant post.

I personally got a 20% margin of safety.

Current price: $20

Estimated price: $25

I'm not very bullish on WILC itself, I'm bullish on one of it's parent companies which I will come to in the follow up post.

Also a lot of people hate Israeli companies on reddit because they think they are all scams and downvote any post about them. This isn't the case, some are gems.

In parts 2 & 3 DCF's I will show you why the parent companies TLV:WLFD and LSE:BSD are far superior purchases and why it pays to do due diligence._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Concern Over Falling US Dollar Value Is anyone else concerned at the staggering drop of the global reserve currency lately? I looked at some old charts of the USD Index and I’m a little worried at the coming year. The last time the USD fell this sharply was at the end of 2018, anyone remember what happened then? (Drop in the market, everyone thought the recession was here). The time before that was 2007, everyone remembers what happened in 2008. The next big decline that caught my eye was 1985-1986, which again, predated a recession. 

However, these are unprecedented times in the market due to the government intervention in the form of liquidity injections into the market via the treasury and federal reserve. Is the market healthy? Is a drop coming in the next 6-18 months? No one knows for sure, but I would like to know some opinions on the matter. Because whether we like it or not, the USD is going to continue to fall._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ SNOW lockup expiration will increase the float 10 times, time to buy put options?

Like a lot of you I have been following Cathy Woods and Ark Investments recently. As many of you probably know, Cathy's investment strategy is based on Wright's law, which states that for every cumulative doubling of units produced, costs decline at a consistent rate. According to Cathy, ARK's research strategy starts by discovering when the costs in various innovative industries have declined to a low enough point to indicate exponential growth in that industry, and therefore the leading companies in that industry. 

Seems simple enough, but I'm curious as to how a retail investor would ever be able to find the relevant information to use a similar strategy. I can only assume that ARK has tons of research vehicles in play to analyze how quickly costs change and at what price level customers will start entering into the market. I've been trying to think if there is a way to find this information in a companies financials, maybe hidden within some relationship of numbers but I just don't know.

Does anybody have anything to contribute? I'm really just curious if other people have gone down this path and whether they have gotten anywhere with it._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Trading individual bonds Hi, I want to buy individual TIPS.

Indoor farming uses 90% less water than traditional farming, and Appharvest is promising to be completely water independent, operating on collected rain water alone; Water futures trading will be the catalyst for Greenhouse and Vertical Farming to boom, they're effectively a hedge against destructive droughts that are projected due to climate change.

There is potential for a correction in the miners. I've noticed for about 3 months now whenever gold drops 1% the miners are down 2% and when gold goes up 1% miners are only up 1%. This reached the point of what I consider unsustainable and irrational sometime this month, most gold miners are down 33% in value trading around pre covid levels, while gold prices remain for the most part unchanged except for its recent drop that it recovered, yet still no signs of life in the miners. These sustained elevated gold prices have given time for miners to generate substantial revenue and increase in yields that will only continue. My long long term outlook is bearish on gold but there is not a doubt in my mind that gold miners are oversold right now in anticipation of some sort of gold crash that if doesn't come soon makes the miners way to oversold.
For example HGU might be a good buy... it went all the way from $34 to $21 with unchanged gold prices and that seems a bit excessive IMO. Golds even close to breaking its three month trend line if we get one or two more greens days I think the change in investor sentiment would be substantial driving miners to new highs if we see $2000 again. No guarantees but I feel confident the risk to reward ratio is looking super sexy on barrick gold or basic gold etfs._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ IBKR withdrawals to any Indian/Middle East Bank.

Anyways, the company has solid execution, big growth factors and a cheap share price.


Check it out, do your own DD!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Short Term Profit Taking Considerations Profit taking. You're up a large percentage and you're afraid that the market will take your profits away as it's done many times. You're also afraid of selling too early and watching your position rise shortly afterwards, like it's done many times. How can you decide whether to sell or hold? Well, here are **a few things to think about.**

1- Selling on the news- Some good news comes out for your position and your stock pops 6 percent in the premarket. Now you should consider selling. Why? Look at a recent examples- Boeing's positive 737 Max news on Nov 18th. There was a large buildup in price in the days prior. (buying the rumour) The stock opened much higher at 223 and ended the session around 203. Example 2- Pfizer's positive vaccine news yesterday. The market sold the covid recovery stocks on the news. Cruises, airlines, and hotels all got rocked.

2- When your position has run up an insane amount in a very short amount of time and may be due for a pullback. Example- snowflake- in 4 days this stock went from 280 to 429. Now it's trading at about 317 a few days later. Any big moves like this should be viewed with suspicion. Example 2- XPEV- After nearly doubling in about 3 trading sessions, the stock plummeted from 74.49 to a low of 42.84 over the next 11 trading sessions. Example 2- Big Tech's massive rally from March to September. It eventually got too hot and [corrected.](https://corrected.It) It's December now and MSFT AAPL AMZN and others still haven't recovered. (google is an exception).

Also note that big upward swings attract the attention of short sellers (think Citron and PLTr) and momentum traders just looking to pump and dump. When this happens, don't think of it as an investment. You should be pumping and dumping too. The bigger the top, the bigger the drop.

3- Going into earnings or some big event that could have a big effect, especially highly anticipated ones and ones that could possibly go wrong. Example- (SPCE) Virgin Galactic's failed space mission. It dropped about 16% or something afterwards.

4- When the uptrend in your position breaks. (technical analysis) Example- NIO- The uptrend broke around the 50 dollar mark. This happened a couple of days after the high of 57. About a week later, it reached its low of 38.43.

5-When your position changes to a consolidation period. (technical analysis) Example- Tesla- spent about 2.5 months consolidating from September to mid November. You would have been better off taking profits at a higher level of the range and either getting back in when Tesla broke out again, or buying back in at a low level of the range and just holding and waiting (for patient people) Example 2- Amazon and MSFT are still consolidating since September.

6-Consider selling when Goldman Sach's upgrades a stock.

**Please note**\- I understand that many of the buy and hold investors here will be offended. But I also know that profit taking is something that many people here are interested in doing better. As I am.

With profit taking, there may also a time to get back in. Example- if you got out of tesla during it's consolidation period, you would have rightly got back in when it broke out again.

With profit taking, you can try to get every dollar. But your focus should be on catching the big move. Worry more about catching the big move, rather than getting out at the very top. It's more efficient.

Obviously there are plenty of counter examples to what I've said. And I've cherry picked examples to express my point. However my point is that these are **things to consider** in profit taking, not any hard fast rules.

I'm not a professional and I don't have a lot of experience. I'm an amateur trader with a shorter term mindset who spends a decent amount of time trying to figure these things out.

There will still be many times when you sell too early or don't sell when you should. It's all part of the game. Don't beat yourself up too much and try to learn from it.

I'd like to trade in EU stock markets and be able to obtain dividends from European companies.

However, my experience is that this tends to be quite annoying if you deal with a bank in the EU, because they do not give you the forms you need for your tax declaration in US (i.e., 1099-DIV), and you end up needing to calculate commissions, currency exchanges, tax paid/withheld, etc. all by hand.

Any financial institutions you can recommend that make this process easy?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ BABA Hi guys,

I want your opinion on BABA. It seems an extremely solid stock with good PE ratio etc. It seems to be struggling to grow in the market in recent times but I can see strong numbers in terms of revenue and earnings etc. My question is do I keep dumping my money into this stock that I believe in or do I just cut my losses and hold what I have. I got in at 305, 286 & 266. Do I invest again at 255 or do I leave it. Are there risks/ blind spots I am missing? It is approx 10% of my stock portfolio currently. Any advice or criticism will be taken on board, relatively new to this (past 9 months or so)_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ BIG?! problem with NIO , LI, XPEV, BABA So i was just doing some research into these big-name Chinese stocks as I have been very interested in buying the dips. So as I'm guessing we all know Chinese stocks are at risk of being de-listed if they do not allow a US auditor to double-check their books, so i decided to look into who these companies are using as their auditors and turns out they ALL use this company PricewaterhouseCoopers, and they are far from squeaky clean having faced many scandals and whistleblowers coming out talking about mal-practice.   
However on a better note PricewaterhouseCoopers also audits a lot of big-name US companies like Bank of America, Chase bank,  Goldman Sachs, IBM, Ford and the list goes on, I would like your thoughts on this

From what I understand, dividend yield is what drives the prices of dividend stocks. If the earnings and by extention dividends are expected to grow by 10% next year, the stock price may also increase by 10% to mantain the yield. Some companies that are very fast growing may have yields that are much lower than other companies because of expectations of high future earnings and thus dividends that investors are willing to pay a premium for.

However, when dividends (or any other form of distributing earnings to shareholders such as share buybacks) are throw out the window, what exactly do investors gain from speculating on future earnings? Sure they can sell their share for a higher price than they bought to another guy who can sell it for an even higher price down the line but why do earnings affect us shareholders if it will ultimately never be passed down to us?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ How much money should I take grom my invesment? I want to do long-term investing in stocks and mutual funds, so i can hopefully be financially independent in the future. But, i have some question about this:

-Do i just keep holding into my stocks until the future?, or can take some portion of my invesment every month?

Sorry if this is a weird question, i am very new to this_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Multi-Home and Apartments New to the world of investing, but can someone explain to me how some properties bring in more monthly revenue compared to the estimated monthly payment. For example This 8 unit apartment complex is on the market for 650k and in the description it states that it brings in 5,800 in monthly revenue, but the monthly payment for the propriety is only 2,200. On paper this seems like it’s free money, but it can’t be that easy to make money right? Would this be a solid investment or a money pit? How long would it take to start seeing profit?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Investing in water through proxies, and the "apocalypse index" Hello!

Before anyone asks "Did you just watch the Big Short?", no (but I did use reddit search for this question and I can see why people might think that).

I became interested in water investing recently because I am of the opinion that climate change is going to fundamentally alter the world as we know it. I'm therefore interested in profiting off of this (dubious as that may be) so that I can ideally provide for myself and my family as the world becomes a more dangerous place. This means I'm interested in investing in anything that may be in higher demand due to the effects of climate change, which could include:

* Mitigation technologies (carbon capture, renewable energy, nuclear energy, hydrogen, etc.)
* Adaptation technologies (genetic modification of crops, passive cooling technologies, etc.)
* The arms industry (I did say I think the world will become a less stable place)
* Water (it's only becoming more and more scarce)

The above are fairly straightforward, except for water. While water futures are newly available for trading on Wall St, and there's a water rights market in Australia (where I live), I'm interested in Michael Burry's approach which I don't quite understand. He invests in water by investing through proxies that use significant amounts of water, such as almond farms (a very water intensive crop). 

The basic logic is that you spend a lot of water to create an almond, but 100,000 almonds are a lot easier to transport than the water needed to grow those same almonds. I'm not sure I fully understand how this works though - I suppose that the "embodied water" of the almond is priced in to the final cost of an almond, but unless the margins on water intensive crops are quite large, isn't there a fairly significant risk that farmers of water intensive crops will actually fail during droughts and in the future as water becomes more and more scarce?

I'm interested in any feedback that people may have on my so-called "apocalypse index" of industries that will boom as climate change progresses further, and super interested in feedback on unusual investments in water (such as water rights in Australia, or water-by-proxy investments). Thanks in advance!

As title says Iv invested 5k USD in overseas crypto trading. I was quite skeptical at first however the 1% per day had paid out after the first month and I have withdrawn around 1.2k after the first month. It’s only 6 day week where the 1% profit is given so it’s $300 a week. I know these figures are extremely high and it is very risky but I want to know what your thoughts are ?

It's essentially a CDO made up of 3 ARK funds, leveraged 1.5x. It is a note, but yet there is no dividend, or coupon payment. Your only payout is principal plus the risk-adjusted return of the lowest performing ARK fund in the set of the 3.  They're only offering about $500,000 in total, which makes me wonder what's the point? It's probably some CPS (Cross Product Sales) asshole trying to get a Christmas bonus.

I always thought JPM was the moral, sophisticated older brother of the big banks. Anyway, the full prospectus is down below.

Ass app in, ass app out._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ ISA equivalent (or thereabouts) in Australia? Hi,

I'm currently reading "I Will Teach You To Be Rich (2nd Edition)". The author talks about investing into ISAs as a strategy for wealth accumulation. 

Only thing is, the book is targetted for UK readers, and I'm in Australia. I've done a bit of research and it seems there is are no ISAs here. 

Could anyone point me towards something equivalent to an ISA for Australia, that's suitable for someone just starting their wealth creation journey and (and doesn't have a great deal of starting capital) ? Also something you can use a 'set and forget' approach on, as I have no intention of micromanaging my investments.

I'm trying to work out the best way to continually invest in my positions over time to ensure that I'm building my positions over time while limiting the downside.

The two strategies that I'm thinking about are; buying the dip (every time a stock hit a negative, add to the position) or, just adding to each position each day irrespective of whether the stock is up or down.

I found this article which put some math behind these strategies - [https://theirrelevantinvestor.com/2020/02/24/what-happens-when-you-buy-the-dip/](https://theirrelevantinvestor.com/2020/02/24/what-happens-when-you-buy-the-dip/)

I'm still not sure which one suits me best and am interested in hearing how other medium/long term investors do this.

Initially I was going to buy a set amount (let's just say $20 to each position where I'm down 1.00%) until I'm not down less than 1%). There's an obvious flaw here, as the position grows the amount ($20) becomes less and less as a percentage and will have less of an effect over time.

So, the stop price is pretty much based on the highest market price since entering the trailing stop order. However, is there a way to calculate the stop price based on the previous closing price? I'd like to avoid intraday movements and only limit my losses based on the previous closing price. With penny stocks for example there's quite a bit of intraday movement and I'd have to set my trailing amount too big to be sure not to have my stocks sold too early.

However, now I am thinking about investing part of my portfolio in some mining stocks, and there are few reasons for it. However, homework first. Never was in this, so trying to do proper research before jumping in.

&#x200B;

**$CDXC:** Right above the golden ascending channel; but holding support right now at the Point of Control. It also is above the 50 & 200EMA as well! Stoch is super low as well, it is a great setup. 

**$CTLT:** This beautiful channel play just confirmed and holding life over this support. which is also an important volume area. Just broke the 50EMA, but indicators are a little worn out, might see a small pullback. 

**$ETN:** Gorgeous channel play here. It is at a support area, channel line, and right near the 200EMA, which is dope. RSI & Stoch are oversold, and showing a Bullish Divergence! 

**$FEYE:** Long term ascending triangle, at its channel support area. Holding support as well, recently oversold, and Stoch is fair. Both EMA's are above so they will be resistance eventually.  

**$GSKY:** This support is very strong, but it has a chance to break down to $3.45. RSI & Stoch oversold which is awesome. Once it breaks this downtrend, it is going to go crazy. 

**$JILL:** Such a beautiful channel for potential massive plays. 200EMA is what it is riding safely, and it is above the 50EMA as well. It broke the downtrend now going back up, this thing has Bullish Divergence and power. 

**$LL:** Very strong channel that is now a rising wedge, and it is perfectly riding the 50EMA line now. Stoch is low, and if it dies more, but at wedge trendline, if it dies more just bounce off 200EMA! 

**$NEW:** Obvious channel but also obvious room for earnings. Support, RSI oversold, Stoch oversold with divergence, and MACD can't get lower -- what a value. 

**$NIO:** 2 Loooooong term channels meeting here, but in an obvious downtrend. If it breaks above here it will go crazy once again. Above 200EMAand such, Stoch and RSI recently oversold as well. 

**$PNW:** The middle golden channel is a great value, and if it lives here it has plenty of room to run. RSI and Stoch oversold, with divergence as well. Great setup. 

**$PSNL:** Previous trendline resistance being tested as a support. If it dies here, re-test the 50EMA then 200EMA, but watchlist this one. Indicators show room to drop. 

**$SWI:** Textbook sell off play into Volume POC and support, and showing life. I you like these type of plays, all indicators show reversal soon - and a good area for it to show life._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_
