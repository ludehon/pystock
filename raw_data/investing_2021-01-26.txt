**Stock:** Denison Mines Corporation  
**Ticker (Share price):** DNN ($0.69 USD), DML.TO ($0.86 CAD)  
**Market Cap:** $685M

**Overview**

Denison  is a Uranium junior with assets in the famous Athabasca basin in  Northern Saskatchewan. Their flagship asset is the 90% stake that they own in their Wheeler River project which they believe will be one of the  uranium mines which will be first to come online in the new cycle. The  Wheeler River project boasts some incredibly low OPEX costs and all-in  costs for the project. The Wheeler river project contains two extremely  high-grade uranium deposits (Phoenix and Gryphon) which combined hold  estimated U308 reserves of 109.4M pounds.

**Management**

CEO:  David Cates was appointed as CEO of Denison in 2015 and is a director  at other Uranium companies such as Goviex and SkyHarbour Resources. I’m  torn on him as CEO. I really like what he is trying to do with ISR  mining but at the same time I think he could have had much better timing  with some of his previous financing rounds. I think the expensive  financing is likely over at this point so his success/failure will  likely hinge on whether or not ISR mining becomes successful.

**ISR Mining (IN SITU RECOVERY MINING)**

Part  of the sell of Denison is the question as to whether or not they can be  successful with their ISR mining methodology in order to realize the  low opex and total costs that they have currently laid out. If this were  to be built it would be the first ISR mine in Canada to reach the  execution phase. 50% of the world’s Uranium production currently comes  from ISR production and for Denison it is now in the testing phase and  getting Canadian regulators on board. ISR has been used in the US and  around the world.

At a high level,  ISR mining involves pumping a solution down into the uranium orebody,  dissolving the uranium, and pumping it back up with minimal CAPEX  expenditures. Once it is pumped up the Uranium is removed from the  pregnant solution and then transported for processing. There are videos  online available if you are a geologist at heart.

What  Denison is claiming is that they are introducing a “contained”  methodology of ISR mining. What this means is that the solution they  pump into the ground to get the Uranium will be contained to prevent the  contamination of the surrounding environment. The contamination is  usually the biggest issue regulators have with ISR mining. **Denison  is essentially proposing a mining methodology that is at the intersect  of extremely low capex, extremely environmentally friendly, and  extremely large margins.**

**Financials**

As of Q3, Denison has $7M of cash on hand along with $11M of working  capital. Their Q3 revenues were $3M, which is down 21% YoY primarily due  to the timing of processing at McClean Lake mill. Their net loss per  share was ($0.01) for Q3. The McLean lake mill is one of the world’s  largest uranium processing facilities and is currently processing ore  from the Cigar Lake mine that is owned by Cameco. Cameco has shut down  Cigar Lake twice this year due to COVID 19 concerns so you can imagine  that would have an impact on Denison’s operating results.

From a pure uranium perspective, in Q3 Denison sold 26,004 pounds of U308 at an average price of $32.76.

For  the Phoenix deposit, Denison estimates that their all-in cost is $8/lb  of U308. With the current spot-price at $30 you can certainly see the  appeal in that cost. Most producers do not have the cost basis to be  successful at $30 and need $40-$60 in order to profitably mine their  Uranium. With the Uranium spot price expected to increase to align with  the average majority’s incentive price, you can quickly see where the  appeal for Denison mines comes into play. Phoenix has about 60M lbs of  the 109M pounds in the Wheeler River deposit so if you expect the spot  price to double (which people are rarely questioning at the moment)  you’re looking at >$3B of uranium at just Phoenix and slightly  smaller amounts at the Gryphon deposit. If it triples? Well, you can do  the math. The takeaway here is that they would be profitable even at  today’s prices and that is not true for 99% of mines. Denison was 15x  higher than today’s stock price during the last Uranium bull-run.

**What could go wrong?**

Permitting.  Exploration and mining all require permits in order to be able to  execute properly. As with other companies in the Athabasca Basin there  is a Native Canadian population with which the land is shared and who  need to be consulted. A good uranium company will work collaboratively  with these stakeholders and not in spite of them. It is always a  possibility they may oppose/block any actions.

ISR:  ISR mining still needs to be approved by Canadian regulators. There is a  possibility that the regulators come back and are not ok with this  methodology and that would have a significant impact on Denison’s  Phoenix deposit.

If anyone's read Rule #1 by Phil Town, I'm curious if y'all have found companies that match the financial requirements he set, and are at the proper value? (For those who don't know, the company has to have an average ROIC of at least 10%, and growth for EPS, Equity, Revenue, and FCF have to be at least 10% for the last 10 years).  I've seen Amazon and iRobot, but I'm looking for more.

If anyone else has any more they've found, let me know I want to look at them!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ ATAC Ever heard of ATAC? Probably not. However, I believe this SPAC will prove to be a lucrative investment with limited to no downside. 

After thorough research concerning SPACs (Special Purpose Acquisition Companies) and the unique merger between Owl Rock Capital Partners and Dyal Capital Partners (a subsidiary of Neuberger Berman), I have concluded that this opportunity classifies as a standard “Dhando investment” (for those of us that know Mohnish Pabrai); the limited downside of Blue Owl Capital (the newly merged company) becoming publicly-traded via ATAC (the SPAC enabling this transaction) is substantially offset by the attractive and likely upside of this investment. Moreover, due to my appealing buy-in price of $10.39, there is limited liability as I will explain later on. 

However, in the case of any purchase, an investor must both assess and limit his/her downside. Through implementing and focusing my decisions on Warren Buffett’s two rules, I have done significant research into SPACs as a whole and their potential downside. Coming to the conclusion that if the deal was to fall through or I deemed the prospects to be unappealing, I am protected through a redeemable purchase price of $10 a share + Interest. Therefore, my investment is limited to around $0.34 per share assuming a conservative $0.05 interest payment. However, I believe that I have done a successful job hedging that loss due to my research.

In regard to a SPAC, one of or if not the most important factor is management. As in any stock, management plays a significant role in the success of a company. However, there is more dependency on management in a SPAC than in any other business due to the Sponsor’s responsibility to (1) acquire a company, and (2) successfully merge. After performing my due diligence I have concluded that Tom Wasserman - with about 30 years of experience in alternative asset management, direct lending, and capital solutions - is extremely qualified to be the Sponsor of such an endeavor. Furthermore, HPS Investment Partners has publicly expressed their support, with over 13 years of experience and $67 billion of AUM. Not only does HPS Investments bring talent/insight to the newly emerged company but they have vouched for ATAC as a viable sponsor for such a merger due to the company’s experience in a similar field. The management of Owl Rock Capital, Dyal Capital, and Neuberger Berman - with principals bringing an average of 18 years of experience - has confirmed that all companies have unanimously agreed to the merger. The likelihood of a successful merger is high and consequently has eliminated the outstanding risk of a SPAC concerning their ability to find a company to bring public. 

As with any investment, investors should take the time to understand the industry in which they are investing in. After a plethora of time, I believe I have a substantial grasp of credit and alternative asset management. With the knowledge I have acquired, the post-merger market cap of about $12.5 billion and 1.25 billion shares issued dictates that there will be an initial per-share price of $10. With that said, after evaluating SPACs as a whole, Owl Rock Capital, Dyal Capital Partners, and ATAC individually, I have come to the conclusion (after reviewing their pro forma financial statements) that Blue Owl will initially earn about $0.25 cents per share with a conservative 18% growth → leading to a conservative price of $12 per share. Blue Owl Capital has reassured my evaluation through various actions that they have taken. For instance, management has issued warrants and founder warrants to the public and Sponsor respectively at a pro forma value of about $14.29, only furthering my belief that the share price will go behind $14.  Further, management has illustrated their internal belief by providing incentives of issuing more equity with a raise in equity price. For example, 100,000,000 shares of Class E common stock will be issued if the stock price was to stay above $15 for a limited period of time. Additionally, Blue Owl Capital has underscored the fact that their P/E ratio will be higher than their industry due to appealing prospects such as immediate growth, doubling AUM, lowering costs, widening profit margins, attaining a larger customer reach, acquiring the backing of various institutional investors, a recovering economy, higher earning power (a business' ability to generate profits over the long haul, assuming all current operational conditions generally remain constant), and an already established monopoly by Owl Rock being the second-largest BDC in the country.

As a futuristic outlook, I believe the rising interest rates on loans through a recovering economy will play in favor of Blue Owl’s direct lending and alternative asset management. Specifically, the leveraged loans towards unfavorable candidates that may struggle to get a loan as the economy recovers and credit begins to tighten. Blue Owl’s potential and likelihood to deem profitable to me has only grown after assessing Owl Rock’s competitors such as Monroe Capital and Stellus Capital Management through a simplistic view. These competitors are priced at about $8.50 per share and $10 per share with $7 billion and $1.6 billion of AUM respectively. Creating market caps of $180 million and $202 million. Without any further research into the outstanding shares and possible dilution associated with these firms, the large values assigned to Blue Owl concerning AUM and Market Cap will likely generate a view of a monopolistic company and further push them towards a larger market share.

There are numerous posts on this sub and others diving into the technical guts behind some of the recent moves behind GME, so I will keep it high level for everyone scratching their heads wondering what's going on.

There has been much talk on CNBC and in other financial media calling what's happening in GME a distortion of the market and an unjustifiable departure from the fundamentals. That is undeniably true. That being said, the distortion is not what's playing out now, but rather what happened about 1.5 years ago when short interest in GME first began to approach (and later exceed) 100% of the available float.

Short selling is usually a tool that aids in price discovery, but like most market mechanisms, at the extremes things get more complicated.

Short sellers, having borrowed shares, are guaranteed (indeed obligated) future buyers of the stock. They put themselves in that position on the thesis that there are reasons to expect the stock price to go down, such that when they buy the shares back they can return what they borrowed at a lower price and pocket the difference. As such, as short interest grows, there is a short term downard push on the price (the initial sale of the borrowed shares), but also future upside pull on the stock price as a natural result, kind of like gravity, but pulling the price upward. Normally that pressure is so slight and subtle that short interest in and of itself should not be a mover of the stock price.

That being said, a common rule of thumb is that you should start to concern yourself with that pressure when short interest crosses the threshold of between 20% and 25% of the effective float (shares actually available to trade). At that level and above, the pressure starts to become noticeable, kind of like the moon causing currents and tides.

GME short interest was recently **140%** of the float. In recent days, short interest has actually continued to accumulate (I'll explain why later).

There is, in effect, a critical mass of short interest hanging over GME's price exerting not subtle pull, but face-ripping force like the gravity of a black hole. A short singularity, if you will.

Previous short squeeze case studies such as VW or KBIO were all about someone engineering a way for effective float to evaporate, suddenly leaving what was previously a relatively reasonable aggregate short interest position in a world of hurt. This is the first time where we're seeing a situation play out where it wasn't someone engineering a shrinkage of effective float, but large market-moving players simply blowing up the short interest to the point where it simply overtook effective float by a large margin. Why would they do that? Because they expected GME to declare bankruptcy in the very near term so that returning borrowed shares costs $0, as the shares are worthless at that point. Also, an arguably intentional side-effect of this massive artificial sell-side pressure on the stock is that it becomes more difficult for GME to obtain any kind of financing to avoid bankruptcy, making it, in theory, a self-fulfilling prophecy. GME, however, did not go bankrupt for reasons that are well explained by other posters.

In order to close their positions and limit their exposure (which remains theoretically infinite otherwise), short interest holders need to collectively buy back more shares than are available on the market, and especially since GME is no longer at risk of imminent bankruptcy, that buying action would push the price into a parabolic upward move, likely forcing brokers to liquidate short interest-holding accounts across the board on the way to buy shares at any price to cover their otherwise infinite liability exposure (and that forced covering will push the price further upward into a feedback loop--like crossing the event horizon of the black hole in our analogy).

So what is happening now, and where do we go from here?

Right now, short-side interests are desperately trying to drive the price down. There has been an across-the-board media blitz to try to scare investors away from GME. But there is really only one way to drive price down directly, and that is selling. In fact, given that most of the large holders of GME long positions are simply sitting on their shares, it means selling. even. more. shares. short.

Even as price has been grinding upward, and liquidity has been evaporating, short sellers, who have lost billions mark-to-market currently (my guess is on the order of $10bn by the end of trading today), can only keep selling, piling on even more exposure and losses, staving off oblivion hour by hour, minute by minute.

GME might also decide to issue more shares to recapitalize its business on the back of the elevated share price, but it is unlikely they could issue enough shares to change the overall trajectory of the stock at this point (especially not given their fiduciary responsibility to current stock holders). It might, however, run the clock out a little while longer.

At this point it looks like there will either be some type of external market intervention by regulators (though I can't see any reason for them to step in myself), or we will soon see what happens when short positions representing \~$8bn in current mark-to-market liability goes parabolic.

Etrade will not give me an answer as to why I was prevented from buying more Palatin stock in December 2020.

This was their customer service response:

Currently, all orders on Palatin Technologies Inc (PTN) require that instructions be provided over a recorded line. Reasons for such a requirement vary but may be due to a reorganization or other corporate action that has not been fully disclosed.

\_\_\_\_\_\_

I finally got through today after 53 minutes on hold and the representative said he would reach out to another team. The other team said they are not allowed to tell me why.

Today I was able to purchase more shares, of course after missing the huge upswing since december. This is strike two etrade...

1. Why is BB's revenue decreasing year on year or quarter on quarter despite so many government business wins?
2. I am under impression that security is crowded field. Is BB so good at end point management/security and miles ahead of the competition that competition doesn't matter to its prospects?
3. Is QNX revenue from automobiles a recurring thing or one time and less than $10? If one time and majority of 175 mn vehicles being non-connected, they don't mean much for direct future revenues.
4. BB IVY is still under development and expected to start deploying in 2023 that at net revenue (post AWS share) of $10-11. So meaningful revenues are likely to start in 2025 and there is a huge execution risk between now and 2023.
5. How to go about valuing BB, is price to sales good measure? If yes, what shall be a reasonable number?

Any thoughts/opinions?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ I wanted to share Matt Levine's discussion on Market Manipulation and GME, it's a good laymen's explanation of the legal ambiguities in securities law Do me, and everyone else a favor and read the entire thing before commenting.  There's a significant trend on this sub of people just commenting bullshit based on what they think a post might say before reading it.  There's a lot of explanation and context here so take your time if you're looking to learn. 


Just a straight copy/paste from his newsletter today: 

If a lot of people on Reddit band together to drive the price of a stock higher, is that illegal? I have been asked that question a lot recently, and I want to be clear that:

1.	I don’t know, and

2.	If I did know, I wouldn’t tell you, because I do not give legal advice in this newsletter, and I particularly do not give legal advice that people on Reddit might read while pumping up stocks.



That said I suppose we should talk about the question in general and extremely not-legal-advice terms. I guess my answer would be that it might be illegal in all sorts of ways, but it is not obviously illegal, and if the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission were to go after WallStreetBets for this stuff they will be breaking new ground and going beyond their previous cases. I do not want to say “this stuff is all fine,” but I will say I am not all that bothered by it.

There are two main things that are illegal. One is “securities fraud.” This basically means lying about a stock. The other is “market manipulation.” Nobody knows what this means. Legally, it means something like:

>To effect, alone or with 1 or more other persons, a series of transactions in any security … creating actual or apparent active trading in such security, or raising or depressing the price of such security, for the purpose of inducing the purchase or sale of such security by others.

So if you buy stock with the purpose of pushing the price up so that other people will buy it, that’s market manipulation. If you buy stock hoping that the price will go up because other people buy it, that’s not market manipulation; that’s just normal. Those things are not so different. There is a “traditional four-part test for manipulation that has developed in case law”: 


1.	I buy some GameStop stock.

2.	I put out rumors—in my subscription newsletter, on Reddit, in fake press releases, whatever—about some catalyst for the stock to go up. “Hey I hear from an inside source that GameStop just got an exclusive contract to supply downloadable video games in Tesla cars,” etc.

3.	People see these rumors, believe them and buy GameStop stock, pushing the price up.

4.	I sell the stock to them at the higher prices.


So consider the general concept of a “pump-and-dump” scheme. The most classic pump-and-dump goes like this:

1) I buy some GameStop stock.


2) I put out rumors—in my subscription newsletter, on Reddit, in fake press releases, whatever—about some catalyst for the stock to go up. “Hey I hear from an inside source that GameStop just got an exclusive contract to supply downloadable video games in Tesla cars,” etc.


3) People see these rumors, believe them and buy GameStop stock, pushing the price up.


4) I sell the stock to them at the higher prices.

This is very straightforwardly illegal and the SEC goes after this stuff all the time, alleging securities fraud. Lying about stocks. Here is the SEC’s “Investor Alert: Social Media and Investing -- Stock Rumors,” which pretty much defines a pump-and-dump this way:

>For example, in a “pump-and-dump” scheme, promoters “pump” up the stock price by spreading positive rumors that incite a buying frenzy and they quickly “dump” their own shares before the hype ends. Typically, after the promoters profit from their sales, the stock price drops and the remaining investors lose money.

There are variations. The SEC has gone after forms of dishonesty that aren’t quite lying about the stock. For instance, if you are a widely followed stock promoter with a subscription tip newsletter, and you email tips to your subscribers and then sell your stock to them while saying that you’re buying, that seems dishonest, and the SEC will go after you. Or if you are a promoter or research firm and you put out positive research about a company, but you don’t disclose that the company paid you to put out the research, that is also bad. 

Now, I think you could do a pump-and-dump without any actual lying. For instance:


1.	I email subscribers to my expensive private newsletter saying “hey let’s pump GameStop.”

2.	We all buy GameStop, knowing that we’re just doing it for the pump, with no real or fake catalyst for the stock to go up.

3.	It goes up, because we bought a lot of it. 

4.	Other people, innocents and high-frequency trading algorithms, see it go up on heavy volume and think “hey this is a good stock, we should buy it.” They buy it, pushing the price up.

5.	We sell the stock to them at the higher prices.


In this version, I have not lied about a stock. On the other hand, I have effected transactions in the stock to create trading activity and raise the price, for the purpose of inducing people to buy it. Seems like market manipulation, “painting the tape” or something. The SEC goes after stuff like this occasionally.

I think that in modern markets you could even do a bit better than that and have a completely honest pump-and-dump:

1.	I show up on Reddit and say “hey let’s pump GameStop.”

2.	We all buy GameStop, knowing that we’re just doing it for the pump, with no real or fake catalyst for the stock to go up.

3.	It goes up, because we bought a lot of it. 

4.	Other people see us doing this, read my Reddit post, know we are pumping the stock, and also buy it, because we seem to be having fun, and they like fun too.

5.	Eventually some of us get bored and start selling and the price collapses.


The point here is that it is at least theoretically possible that no one buys stock for any reason other than “hey it’s a fun pump.” That is, no one is deceived about the fundamentals (there’s no fake news about the company), and also no one is deceived about the technicals. No one says “huh this stock is up on a lot of good buying pressure, I should buy some”; everyone who buys says “hey this stock is up because it’s being pumped, and if I get in now I might still get out before it collapses, and that’ll be fun.” It is “respect the pump” as a quasi-mystical mantra.

I bet the SEC would say that’s market manipulation, but I am not so sure. I suppose we did our trading “for the purpose of inducing the purchase or sale of such security by others,” but not by deceiving them about what’s going on. “Join us in a fun game of chicken,” was our basic message here. Did we try “to create or effect a price or price trend that does not reflect legitimate forces of supply and demand”? Who’s to say what’s “legitimate”? Surely the price did not reflect expectations about future cash flows, but just as surely the price reflected supply and demand: We all wanted to own it because we were having fun, so the price went up. 

Anyway, the actual GameStop situation. I suppose it’s possible that someone on Reddit has posted fake rumors about GameStop’s business, but I haven’t seen any. The posts I’ve seen about GameStop have been either (1) substance-free “GME to $1,000” stuff or (2) arguments based on publicly available information plus personal opinion and guesses about the future. They might be wrong or exaggerated or misstated, but it’s not, like, core fraud.

Is it manipulation? Well, there is not a lot of deception here. No one is buying GameStop stock because they think to themselves “boy this stock is going up a lot on heavy volume, must be a bunch of big institutions who see fundamental value here.” There is absolutely wall-to-wall coverage of GameStop in financial media, and it pretty much all says “lol those crazy redditors, pushing up the stock for no reason.” So at worst this is a sort of honest pump, people banding together to do it for the lolz and hoping they can get out before it collapses. 

I’m not even convinced it’s that though. The stock closed Friday at its all-time high. Roaring Kitty was up $11 million. Everyone came back on Monday and did it again. My model here—and I should emphasize this is purely a guess—is that the people most identified with the GameStop trade on Reddit, at this point, are much more interested in securing their legendary status on Reddit than they are in taking profits at the expense of whoever came in later. 

You could have other miscellaneous theories about words like “collusion” and “short squeezes.” Is it illegal for people to band together to all buy stock at the same time? “If institutional investors had an internet site or chat where they arguably cajoled each other or coordinated to buy stock to move the price higher,” one reader asked me by email, “wouldn’t that be stock manipulation and wouldn’t the SEC get involved?” 

Well, a while back there were reports that the SEC was looking into hedge fund “idea dinners,” where hedge funds get together to pitch each other on their third-best ideas. 1  That sounds like institutional investors having a chat where they cajole each other to buy stock in a coordinated way. But the SEC wasn’t concerned about market manipulation. The SEC was concerned that the hedge funds might be a “group” under the securities laws, if they teamed up to own more than 5% of the stock, and that they hadn’t made the necessary group disclosures. This is less of a concern for small retail investors, just because they are less likely to get above 5% of the company. 2  Also it doesn’t seem like the idea-dinner probe went anywhere. Telling your friends that you like a stock and they should buy it is, more or less, fine.

Or is a short squeeze illegal? One popular topic on WallStreetBets is recalling stock borrow. Kochkodin’s article describes one call to action in April 2020:

>The final all-caps sentence imploring GameStop owners to call their brokers and tell them to not lend them short opened a new theater to wage war against short-sellers.

>It’s a little known fact, and one that you wouldn’t expect to learn on a Reddit message board, that a stockholder can request that shares they own outright not be lent out to short-sellers.

If everyone bands together to recall stock borrow, there will be fewer shares available for short sellers, and the short sellers will be forced to cover their bets by buying stock, pushing the price up more. Is that illegal? Is it illegal to make borrow impossible with the goal of messing with short sellers?

The SEC might think so, actually. In 2012, it brought charges against Phil Falcone and Harbinger Capital Partners LLC for, among other things, having “conducted an illegal ‘short squeeze’ to manipulate bond prices.” I confess I do not understand why the SEC thought a short squeeze was illegal, or what they think the fraud was, but the Falcone short squeeze is one of my all-time favorite financial stories and I advise you to read the complaint for humor and inspiration. Quick summary: Falcone owned some bonds of a company called MAAX Holdings Inc. “After hearing rumors that a Wall Street financial services firm was shorting the MAAX bonds and also encouraging its customers to do the same, Falcone decided to seek revenge.” So he bought all the MAAX bonds. Then he bought more: Short sellers would borrow MAAX bonds (presumably from him), and then sell them to him, so that he ended up with “22 million more bonds than MAAX had ever issued.” Then he stopped lending them out, forcing the short sellers to buy bonds to cover their shorts. But there were no bonds to be bought, since he owned them all (and more). At some point an executive from the “Wall Street firm” called up Falcone to talk about the situation, and even in the SEC’s dry language you can tell that it was one of the greatest conversations in all of Wall Street history:

>At some point, the conversation turned to the trading in the MAAX bonds. The senior officer asked Falcone how the Wall Street firm might satisfy its obligation to Harbinger. Falcone stated that the Wall Street firm should just keep bidding for the bonds. Falcone acknowledged that the Wall Street firm would suffer some losses doing so, but told the senior officer and the others that sometimes you are just on the wrong side of a trade.

>In the course of this discussion, Falcone stated that he knew that the short position in the MAAX zips had created a “long” position in excess of the issue size. When the senior officer asked how he could possibly know this, Falcone stated that he was working the position himself and that he (i.e., Harbinger) had acquired approximately 190 million bonds. The senior officer and the other the Wall Street firm personnel were stunned.

“Just keep bidding for the bonds,” “sometimes you are just on the wrong side of a trade,” I love it so much.

Where were we? Oh, right, GameStop. I suppose a really coordinated successful effort to squeeze borrow might count as market manipulation, at least in the SEC’s view, but I’m not sure how serious this effort was. In any case it hasn’t worked. “Despite a punishing two weeks and relentless chat-room taunting, GameStop Corp. haters are showing no signs of surrender,” Bloomberg reported yesterday; short interest has barely budged, and there are still shares available to borrow.

I don’t know. Taking a step back: Should the SEC care about all of this? On the one hand, I do not see a whole lot of deception in this GameStop situation. The SEC’s core concerns, about people lying about stocks and tricking the innocent, don’t seem especially implicated here; everyone is having reasonably informed and consensual fun. 

On the other hand it is all pretty dumb? Like if you are a securities regulator, you can think of your job narrowly as preventing people from lying about stocks, or more broadly as encouraging capital formation and fostering confidence in markets and moving markets toward efficiency and perfection. And, you know, this is the opposite of that. A popular conclusion from the GameStop story is “well I guess the stock market is nonsense now,” and I’m not sure that conclusion is wrong. Seems like the sort of thing the SEC wouldn’t like. But what can they do about it?

Would a trailing stop work on GME after it peaks or is there a chance there are *no buyers* for shares?

Holding of course but just curious. Is the trail stop limit could be hit, but it won't sell for that price or even close?

I vaguely recall someone saying this but don't quite understand it._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Interest rates at zero means that it's highly likely that the economy's prospect of growth is zero or less than zero If interest rates have to be set at zero to stimulate growth, that means that investors aren't willing to pay a single dollar in interest for their investments. Short term, this means what everyone thinks, that money is free and investments will shoot up.

Longer term, it's a sign of zero growth and when the market reaches it's true value with such low interest rates - the forward growth will be zero or negative. Really what these interst rates mean is that we cant even get an investor to pay a 2 % per year to invest in the future of several countries.

Think about it. Isn't that pretty messed up? People here will now say that with zero interest rates, the roof for markets is infinite - that is correct. But if interest rates go up to even 0,1 % with an infinite valuation - even that tiny raise could lead to a huge crash.

So the question is. Why are so few willing to pay to borrow money to invest in Americas (and several other countries) future? Because the future outlook is awful, just awful. Sooner or later this realization will hit people and the markets will react.

It also means that inflation isn't coming. More likely if my assumptions are correct, fall of asset prices is the first step, then delation of money and then we hit inflation. Why? Because if the prospects for growth is zero and stocks go up. As soon as the interest rate rises, stocks go down. People sell stocks, stocks go down even more. People won't spend money, leads to deflation. Then people realize that commodities and other things are getting more and more expensive and harder to come by, that leads to inflation. Problem here is that there is no guarantee that stocks will go with that inflation, rather we could have a terrible situation with inflation of money, lower stock prices and higher prices of living.

Position:194 shares at $19.28


Disclaimer: I started trading this January and my views are purely informational and I do not condone anyone making financial/trading decisions based on this post. Do your DD before you trade. This is a bullish take on BB and may have some holes in it.



So I have been watching BB for a while now and feel the company is undervalued. Forgive me as I have not made a DD post before, I failed English in high school, and I am typing this up on my phone.


BB originally caught my attention because it struck me that it survived being primarily a phone company and shifted its business to its cyber security and other software. I Put it on my watch list to swing it a little bit and recently sold 140 shares at $11.


Seeing the price go up and the volume I decided I would jump back in since the trend analysis looked pretty good. Bought in at 19.28 and it almost immediately crashed, I suspect likely due to the pullback the whole market had this morning with stimulus talks being delayed.


Canada Halts trading today due to the volatility followed by BB making a statement in response basically saying idk why investors are buying up the stock we haven’t made any announcements 
Trading resumes and the price rises back up beyond open in AH, closing at nearly 20 dollars.

THEN as you have already probably seen, BB announces partnership with Baidu - coincidence? Probably not, investors probably coaxed that information out of them and they likely didn’t want to get caught in some insider trading schenangians. 

Speculation for tomorrow: BB Will open strong and meet or exceed the 40% growth of today since it just got that huge news. Baidu is Chinese google, and they partnered with BB since they need a operating system platform to mass produce their maps software in autonomous/ev vehicles with their partner GAC. Now this is a lot of China talk but BB is headquartered in CANADA which is much friendlier in regards to trade than the U.S.


A little bit of information about GAC, they are a Chinese automotive giant that has came to the United States National Automobile Dealers association expos begging for investors, however has not had much success since the last 4 years have not been good for U.S. and China Trade.


The LONG game: Once our new administration warms up to China after those in charge of trade take their cuts, (and they will because history repeats itself, but right now the bear case would be that Biden is not looking to change tariffs on China, playing tough until he gets some leverage is what I think is really going on) GAC will have lots of opportunity to start putting their vehicles on our roads. 
GAC is the highest rated car brand in China so it may have a chance in the United States if it plays its cards right, which means we could have Blackberry powered Autonomous EVs on our streets in the next 5 years. 

This company has a lot of value in our up and coming future of Electric and Autonomous vehicles.

Speculations, euphoria, hype, "prodigy" investors.... It has happened and will continue to happen for as long as the stock markets exist. 

However, no matter the market conditions, the fundamentals and logic behind investing should not change. Here is a little quote from the timeless "the intelligent investor" book.

>*An investor calculates what a stock is worth, based on the value of its businesses. A speculator gambles that a stock will go up in price because somebody else will pay even more for it. As Graham once put it, investors judge “the market price by established standards of value,” while speculators “base \[their\] standards of value upon the market price.” For a speculator, the incessant stream of stock quotes is like oxygen; cut it off and he dies. For an investor, what Graham called “quotational” values matter much less. Graham urges you to invest only if you would be comfortable owning a stock even if you had no way of knowing its daily share price.*

To all fellow investors, have fun and invest smartly.


EDIT: 

Getting a lot of flak from some users because apparently it seems as though I’m implying that traditional value investing is the only true way.

This is not my point. There is a wide spectrum between speculation and investing. There is skilled speculation as there is skilled investing. Likewise, there is unskilled speculation and unskilled investing. 

My reminder to all is simple.

If the speed limit is 100km/h and you so decide to drive at 300km/h, my reminder is please know that you are speeding, be careful at the bends, have both hands on the steering wheel, wear your seatbelt and keep your eyes extra wide. Is driving at 300km/h necessarily bad, if you were a skilled Formula 1 driver? Probably not. It is, however, incredibly dangerous if you just came out of driving school. That is my point. Too many investors these days are speeding because everyone else is, thinking they are driving safely. Without any precautions, plans or skill, your risk of crashing and burning is incredibly high. Right now, we are on a straight road and I don’t know how far the straight road extends, but when it gets bumpy and winding, how sure are you that the same speed that is getting you to your destination quicker, isn’t going to be the same speed that kills you?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Winners in the retail REIT space?

What do you guys think?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Why would Gamestop (GME) succeed in selling games online? Gamestop's business model back in the days was to sell games in brick and mortar shops. This worked well for Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo because they didn't have to deal with running a retail business; it was cost effective to just give a cut to GME. The gaming console companies were effectively paying Gamestop for the service of running stores to sell their games. In the digital world however, why would someone buy games from Gamestop when they could just buy it on the Playstation Store or the Nintendo eShop? I don't know a single person who buys iOS apps outside the Apple App Store. I don't know a single person who buys Android apps outside the Play Store.

I don't know if this is the right place to post this, but here goes. 

For a little background I work as a hedge fund analyst, so researching stocks is essentially what I do on a daily basis. The discrepancy between the research and resources an institution has in comparison to a retail investor is astounding, and I was hoping I could narrow this gap. Looking around there doesn't seem to be a quality service that offers quality stock research with unbias analysis for the everyday investor. There are things like Morningstar and Zacks but they are either expensive or terrible (talking about Zacks). So I wanted to ask the community would you be willing to pay for a service that can provide high-quality research on stocks with a unbias view. Rather than paying for a subscription and not using 90% of the offered resources the investor can simply request a report for a specific stock and will only be charged for that report. Therefore you can pay for only what you want. 

My thought is I would get together a group of my hedge fund buddies who love equity research as much as an I do and we would do the analysis on a per request basis to start off. 

Let me know what you guys think? Is it something people on this forum would actually pay or am I just over-analyzing the situation?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Question: Incurring taxes now for better returns later Hi all, I'm relatively new to investing and have a general question about the implications of selling a stock in order to then buy another with the proceeds.

So, to be exact I was planning to sell shares of VFIAX in order to buy VOOG with the proceeds (and by all means I welcome better suggestions). This is money I expect to leave for at least a couple years and I welcome extra volatility for better gains since I don't expect to really need it in the near future. My question is, is there a way to figure out how long I would have to let the VOOG shares grow in order for it to make up for the 15% tax I'll be accruing on the VFIAX sale? My rough math with the numbers I used showed that I'd be taxed \~$340 on the sale and then I'd be gaining an extra \~$60/year if I were to make an extra 2% with VOOG (conservative estimate). The way my simple mind sees this is that I'd need to let it sit for 5-6 years before the extra gains made up for the taxes on the sale.

I feel like I'm missing something or not taking something into account. Let's just say I'm not a math whiz. Can you let me know if my logic here is sound, or if not can you set me straight?

**$SOLO** \- SOLO graced my buy zone today, barely, and immediately bounced back up. This is still going to be a hot EV stock that I believe will have no problems getting to $11 next EV bull cycle. Specifically I like this company because it is a cheap stock that beginners with low account balances can sell covered calls with. If you believe in the EV industry, and don't mind holding this mid-long term, it is a good choice with decent premiums.

**$CC IV** \- Churchill Capital Investment holdings that is rumored to merge with Lucid Motors. This is a risky play if you just buy naked calls, therefore I recommend buy the rumor, sell to fools. Premiums for covered calls are high right now as this stock is gaining a lot of online attention and hype. If you can afford $2500 for 100 shares, you'd be a to profit off the rising premiums. Be aware that if the merger falls through, share prices will fall to $10.

Wait for the gap to be filled, if it will at all, and get comfortable in a cheaper position. This one could be the next huge gainer. I would personally sell covered calls, or short term OTM option that isn't heavy on the capital.

* Entry: <$3.80
* Risk: 4.5

**$REGI** \- Renewable Energy Group is a company that is focused on providing cleaner, low carbon intensity products and services. Anything clean energy or renewable energy is a yes for me and lately this one is a little overlooked by some clean energy ETFs. Currently my Technical Analysis shows a strong trend that REGI has formed. I won't be in any rush to buy this and will wait for it to hit my trendline again. After it does, I expect a movement towards $125. I'd save capital and go with mid to long term calls.

Disclaimer: The comments opinions and analysis expressed herein are for informational and educational purpose only and should not be considered as individual advice or recommendations._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Can an investor make money (through buying the shares) off a stock which is being shorted? And how does the short make the stock go down in the long term? Lets say as an investor, you find a stock which is shorted. The number of shares shorted is almost the same as, or even more than the float. The share price has declined over time steadily. 

However, you believe in the company and can't see any huge problems with it. Is it simply a case of investing there and then and waiting long? Because in 3 or 6 months, that stock will have to go up? If this is the case, does this mean short sellers can short sell a stock over several months, and if so, how? I thought shorts were short term positions? Wouldn't they lose money every time they go through the cycle, becuase when they buy the stock again at a lower price, it should get pushed up? Look at GME as the example, it's been in slow decline for 6-8 months, and has only changed when investors have all piled in at once to drive the demand up. Or is it a case of investing when you think the shorts will re-buy, thus 'piggybacking' onto their purchases and getting on the price climb associated with their short?

With the above being said (and assumed correct), how are the shorts continually able to make a stock go down? If a stock is shorted at $20, and it drops to $15 and the short makes the $5 profit, doesn't the stock then go back up when they buy it back? 

Again, lets take the GME example, how are the shorts able to make it continually go down over the course of several months and not see it rise, and it needs thousands of investors to dump all their cash in at once to cause a Gamma squeeze before it goes up? 

The shorts must be making it go down, otherwise they wouldnt be shorting it, right?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ SPCE Okay so currently the three highest shorted stocks are: GME, SPCE, and AMC.

Now unlike GME, SPCE has a TON of legitimate potential. They're vying to become the future of fast long-distance transportation, and are one of the most future oriented companies. Now that said they're still an extremely risky play, but they're no where near as risky as GME is. 

Could SPCE be ripe for a short-squeeze? 

What do you guys think of this play? 

\-  This is not investment advice. You can do whatever you want with your own money._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Why do institutions continue to allow shorting? This is no doubt about GME, but arent investment institutions like, fidelity, schwab, etc absorbing a bunch of risk by allowing short selling to continue? Shouldn't they stop short selling rentals?

How do these Institutions hedge this risk of a short squeeze? It seems like Interactive Brokers hedges their risk through the stock enhancement program._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Werner Invests in TuSimple to Spur Autonomous Trucking It is intended to demonstrate, among other things, Werner’s focus on the growth and deployment of automated driving systems, the regulations required for increased safety, reduced carbon emissions and eventual industry adoption, according to the Omaha, Neb.-based company.
TuSimple is focused on improving truck safety and fuel efficiency through its SAE Level 4 technology, in which the vehicle can travel without driver input or backup assistance, at least within specific areas and conditions.


“Our customers are experiencing continued business transformation, one that requires immediate fulfillment, industry leading service and safety and a greater desire for solutions that further their business and the sustainability of our planet,” Werner CEO Derek Leathers said in a press release.
At the same time, staying current with emerging technologies helps improve drivers’ lives, keeps them safer, provides drivers with “best-in-class equipment and helps them achieve long-term careers in the trucking industry,” he added.
In related news, TuSimple announced it added to its executive advisory board Schneider CEO Mark Rourke. Motor carrier and logistics company Schneider took a “nominal investment” in TuSimple and will provide a test fleet as it, too, shapes the future of autonomous trucking.

In recent years, Green Bay, Wis.-based Schneider has invested in advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) such as collision mitigation and adaptive cruise control, which are the foundation of autonomous vehicle technology. 
Schneider ranks No. 5 on the Transport Topics Top 100 list of the largest for-hire carriers in North America. It ranks No. 18 on the Transport Topics Top 50 list of the largest logistics companies.
Werner's investment in TuSimple followed Werner’s announcement in May of Werner EDGE, an initiative that promotes technology-rich driver solutions — including machine learning to improve critical event management, cloud-based breakdown management and tablet-based telematics.
Werner Enterprises ranks No. 16 on the for-hire TT100 and No. 17 on the logistics Top 50.


Meanwhile, TuSimple, which has offices in San Diego and China, added other partnerships over the past year.
In September, TuSimple and Traton Group, Volkswagen AG’s heavy-truck unit, announced a partnership to develop SAE Level 4 self-driving trucks, calling it a first in Europe. Traton also took a minority stake in TuSimple.
In July, TuSimple and truck and engine maker Navistar International Corp. announced a strategic partnership to co-develop SAE Level 4 self-driving trucks targeted for production by 2024.



In November, the boards of directors at Traton and Navistar approved a definitive agreement to merge as part of a transaction valued at $3.7 billion.
TuSimple President Cheng Lu told Transport Topics at the time of its announcement with Navistar: “What we are doing is designing, basically a new truck. The brains, what the body looks like, where you put the sensors, how you get the power. They’re not just buying a component from us. So you can imagine the amount of work that takes. It is something we have to be very selective about in terms of partnerships.”

N&B shares will then be exchanged 1-1 for shares of International Flavors & Fragrances (IFF). So IFF is buying Duponts N&B division?


At first glance it seems like this is free money. But then there is some language that you aren't guaranteed the full amount if too many people elect to take the exchange offer? And I could end up with shares worth less than before if we do?


I'm not sure what to do. I don't fully understand what happens if I do nothing, or what happens if I take the offer. Any help appreciated.

 Offer terms

Latest Update:01/05/2021 2:18 PM ET
CUTOFF DATE: 01/28/2021 7:00 PM ET
EXPIRATION DATE: 01/29/2021 3:00 PM ET
WITHDRAWAL DATE: 01/28/2021

DuPont de Nemours, Incorporated is offering to exchange all of the outstanding 
shares of Nutrition & Biosciences, Incorporated (N&B) Common Stock, for shares 
of DuPont Incorporated Common Stock, at a final exchange ratio to be           
determined. The offer will be subject to proration.                            
                                                                               
The exchange offer is designed to provide shareholders an opportunity to       
exchange their shares of DuPont Common Stock for shares of N&B Common Stock,   
which will convert into shares of IFF Common Stock at a 7% discount to the     
per-share value of IFF common stock.                                           
                                                                               
For each $100 of DuPont Common Stock accepted in the exchange offer, you will  
receive approximately $107.53 of N&B Common Stock, subject to an upper limit of
0.7180 shares of N&B Common Stock per share of DuPont Common Stock.            
                                                                               
Upper Limit: If the Upper Limit is in effect, you may receive less than $107.53
of N&B stock for each $100 of DuPont stock. Based on the average DuPont price  
and average IFF price you could receive much less. The exchange offer does not 
provide for a lower limit or minimum exchange ratio.                           
                                                                               
If the upper limit is in effect, then the exchange ratio will be fixed at that 
limit, and you will receive 0.7180 shares of N&B Common Stock per share of     
DuPont Common Stock.                                                           
                                                                               
IMPORTANT: Immediately following consummation of the exchange offer (and, if   
necessary, the spin-off), Neptune Merger Sub I, Incorporated, a wholly owned   
subsidiary of IFF will merge with and into N&B, whereby the separate corporate 
existence of Neptune Merger Sub I, Inc. will cease and N&B will continue as the
surviving company, and a wholly owned subsidiary of IFF. In the Merger, each   
share of N&B Common Stock will be converted into one share of IFF Common Stock 
common stock. Accordingly, shares of N&B common stock will not be transferred  
to participants in the exchange offer: such participants will instead receive  
shares of IFF Common Stock in the Merger. No trading market currently exists or
for shares of IFF Common Stock.                                                
                                                                               
The final calculated per-share value of DuPont Common Stock and N&B Common     
Stock for the purposes of calculating the exchange ratio will be equal to:

     daily volume-weighted average prices ("VWAP") of DuPont Common Stock on   
     the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE") for each of three consecutive    
     trading days ending on and including the third trading day preceding the  
     expiration date of the exchange offer period (the "Valuation Dates"), as  
     reported by Bloomberd L.P. through the Price and Volume Dashboard for     
     "AQR."                                                                    
  2. With respect to N&B Common Stock, the simple arithmetic average of the    
     daily VWAP of IFF Common Stock on NYSE for each of the Valuation Dates,   
     as reported by Bloomberg L.P. through the Price and Volume Dashboard for

The final exchange rate will be announced in a press release to be issued 11:59

three consecutive trading days ending on and including the second trading day  
preceding the expiration date of the exchange offer, currently expected to be

But that doesn’t mean you SHOULD invest when interest rates are low.
