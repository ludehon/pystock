Sold for a big loss and watched it go up the very next day _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ SOLO, electromecanica _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ YSG IPO. I’m surprised I haven’t seen more here. _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $TLS - A baby Palantir has hatched! Welp, I have had the extremely good fortune of being one of the people who jumped into Palantir with both feet on IPO day, and I am here today with another tip.

I have been watching all these tech IPOs, and most of them have been doing exceptionally well for the past few months. So any time I see an IPO now, I check it out.

**Today a tiny little baby Palantir was hatched - Telos Corporation - $TLS**

# Ties to big brother. ✅

Like Palantir, Telos is a cyber security company. And like Palantir, these guys do work for the military and US government.

# Connections with the right people. ✅

They have a board member who is a General that was in charge of the US cyber security:

&#x200B;

>*General Keith B. Alexander, USA, served as the Commander, U.S. Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM) and Director, National Security Agency/Chief, Central Security Service (NSA/CSS), Fort George G. Meade, MD. As Commander, USCYBERCOM, he was responsible for planning, coordinating and conducting operations and defense of DoD computer networks as directed by USSTRATCOM. As the Director of NSA and Chief of CSS, he was responsible for a Department of Defense agency with national foreign intelligence, combat support, and U.S. national security information system protection responsibilities.*

# Topical. ✅

As I am sure you all have noticed, once one industry leader blazes a trail, all their little competitors seem to follow suit. (See TSLA -> NIO -> XPEV -> MGNI)

So my DD is quite a simple one, Palantir is blazing the trail and these guys are just a mini Palantir.

I think there is a real chance this stock sees some major movement in the coming days. I wouldn't go balls to the wall and dump your whole portfolio in. I would recommend you just put a little play money in to see what happens.

# Cool name. ✅

Plus, their name is pretty fuckin cool. Telos has something to do with some Greek gods and a philosopher or some shit.

# Room to moon. ✅

TLS has a current market cap of about $1B and Palantir is on track for $35B.

# Priced like a McDouble.  ✅

These guys did 159.22 million in revenue last year. With a roughly 1B market cap they're only trading around 5x annual revenue. Compared to our dearest Palantir... trading around 47x last years revenue?

&#x200B;

**Caution:**

I want to add a cautionary note, these guys are NOT in the same league as Palantir, and I am in no means trying to suggest that they are. Instead, I just think these guys are a very cheaply priced company that looks and smells like Palantir.

&#x200B;

Happy hunting folks.

Dollar General, in terms of stock or options, seems fairly undervalued considering their earnings is coming up. Friday would probably be the best time to get in some long $220/$230 calls. 

#IV is very low

1) Average Same store sales have not been negative since 1983, in a pandemic too! All positive sales growth.

**2) Recently opened 17,000th store, now imagine if avg same store sales growth has been positive every year, then if they have more stores, then overall growth is going to be bigger. Especially in a pandemic where people want cheaper supply.**

3) Open stores in the perfect markets(ie. small towns and food deserts) Where WMT is 30 minutes away, why not shop at Dollar General 10 minutes away, and it’s cheaper!!

#They prey on poor white Americans 

^^^ If you’re from /r/politics this might be the play for u, i know y’all AOC supporters really HATE poor, traditional marriage preserving, whites from ALABAMER (pls mods this is joke, i am not politic man)

**4) DG is not a dollar store, which is why they’ve outperformed DLTR. They are closer to a BIG, which surprise surprise, has also outperformed discount retail with DG**

**5) To my point 4, they’re a discount store, not a dollar store. People are being cost-effective in this pandemic so shop at a cheaper grocery place**

6) I lived in AmityVille and had a new Dollar General open in Amityville. Lemme tell you, i’ve see mad people go there and DGs target market is areas where min wage is 8-10$ not $15! (i’ve never entered though because i’m scared of people darker than my mother (she is from india)). love ya mom!!! 🥰😘😘 

So yea, something has to be going good for DG, i got that macro DD and that local, micro-DD, about a newly opened store in my areas

Again, **points two and four** are highlighted for a reason. I’m not manipulating data, technical wise LOOK AT THE stock chart. it’s held $208 pretty well and i’ve actually flipped a pretty penny the past days just buying at open when that happen.

again, read points 2,4,5 those are the biggest reasons this stock is up 24% since march or some shit

ARCT saw a bounce back because PFE's vaccine proves that mRNA treatment works. Now ARCT is back at $60 from a 50% drop.

GDRX will see the same bounce back, for similar reasons. Amazon validates their business model. GDRX also had their CEO go out today and explain how GDRX business model is better than Amazon's for prescription drugs:

the focus on inflammatory disease is what got me interested in this in the first place.  Huge unmet need, treatments are long antiquated.

\----

 Chronic inflammatory diseases are the most significant cause of death in the world. The World Health Organization (WHO) ranks chronic diseases as the greatest threat to human health. The prevalence of diseases associated with chronic inflammation is anticipated to increase persistently for the next 30 years in the United States. in 2000, nearly 125 million Americans were living with chronic conditions and 61 million (21%) had more than one. In recent estimates by Rand Corporation, in 2014 nearly 60% of Americans had at least one chronic condition, 42% had more than one and 12% of adults had 5 or more chronic conditions. Worldwide, 3 of 5 people die due to chronic inflammatory diseases like stroke, chronic respiratory diseases, heart disorders, cancer, obesity, and diabetes.

  Dr. Woody shares a little about himself and the world class team of scientists, physicians, and executives that now comprise the 180 Life Sciences management team and board of directors. He also discusses the company’s drug pipeline and plans moving forward, including what lies ahead and anticipated critical milestones. “I started my career in biotech as the Chief Scientific Officer and Senior Vice President of Research and Development at Centocor, where I led the team responsible for developing Remicade, the first of the TNF (tumor necrosis factor) inhibitor biologics,” Dr. Woody states in the letter. “This was in collaboration with Prof. Sir Marc Feldmann, one of the founders of 180 Life Sciences and the current Co-Chairman of the Board of Directors. Marc and I go back a long way, to the late 70s. Remicade was a breakthrough product, it was the first anti-TNF to show dramatic efficacy and triggered the ‘antibody revolution.’ According to a report in FiercePharma, Remicade sales topped $7 billion USD in 2016 and were $5 billion in 2019.”

TL;DR - IVE COMING OUT AS A GAY BEAR??? MTN 170P 4/16  


This will be a simple DD (shitpost?). I am on the ground in Breckenridge, Colorado and I’m seeing this all develop in person. Summit County (county where the ski resort is located) is about to be shut down. The ski resort is going to be forced to close. There’s really no doubt. It’s coming and the ripples are going to tear through Vail Resorts.   


(I was told to add a chart)

https://preview.redd.it/05bah0qj79061.png?width=1446&format=png&auto=webp&s=37e13b47a061016826260b1a8025f742ba660d7f

So let’s look. What is working against MTN?

1. Government Shutdowns & COVID  
2. Hiring the Seasonal Workforce  
3. Impact on Revenue During 2020-2021 Ski Season  
	Mountain Capacity  
	Concession Sales  
	Epic Pass Carryover

  
**Government Shutdowns**

Shutdowns are coming. They may not be like March but they are coming in some form. These shutdowns will stop unnecessary travel. People are not going to be allowed to go on their ski vacations this year. And with mounting pressure from the public based on the exponential number of cases, politicians will look to save face. 

These shutdowns not only affect the resort directly but indirectly by limiting vacation housing as well. I have friends in the vacation rental management biz here who are seeing a skyrocketing number of reservation cancellations...not just from travel restrictions, but because travelers are getting sick. More people are sick now than March and we’re still open. Does that make sense?

&#x200B;

Let’s look at the three biggest mountains in the United States:

Breckenridge Ski Resort  
\#1 most visited mountain in US   
Last Summit County Health Order - 11/13 [LINK](https://www.summitcountyco.gov/DocumentCenter/View/27752/Amended-and-Restated-PH-Order---COVID-19?bidId=) (NEW ONE COMING TOMORROW 11/20)  
As I said I am on the ground in Breck. Almost everyone expects Summit County to get shut down on 11/20. Last time the county went to “Stay at Home” everything shut down. Short term rentals (where everyone stays) were closed down, all existing reservations were cancelled. People could not travel and the ski resort closed for two and a half months. Summit County closing could be the first domino to fall.

Ownership: Vail Resorts

Vail Ski Resort  
2nd most visited mountain in US  
Last Eagle County Health Order - 11/18 [LINK](https://www.eaglecounty.us/PublicHealth/Documents/Public_Health_Order/)  
Eagle County is in Colorado’s “Orange - Safer at Home” levels

Ownership: Vail Resorts

Park City Ski Resort   
3rd most visited mountain in US  
Utah State of Emergency Order - 11/8 [LINK](https://coronavirus-download.utah.gov/Governor/EO-2020-75.pdf)  
Last Summit County (Utah) Health Order -  10/21 [LINK](https://summitcountyhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Joint-Public-Health-Order-2020-10-signed.pdf)

Ownership: Vail Resorts

(Just for fun Keystone is the 5th most visited mountain in the US is also located in Summit County just like Breckenridge)

Ownership: Vail Resorts

  
This is a seasonal business that is going to be shut down during its only season. The 1st and 5th biggest mountains are tip toeing critical levels. The 2nd and 3rd are moving towards them.

&#x200B;

**Locked Down Resort Making No Revenue With Mounting Expenses**

If you do not know, Vail Resorts brings in international seasonal workers to operate their resorts during the winter. Now imagine this scenario…the mountains are all opening up. Your seasonal work is here from all over the world ready to go. Your mountain gets closed down. What do you do with the seasonal work? Send them home? You do that and the mountain reopens you have no employees to run your mountain. Fire them? All the restaurants and businesses are closed, how are they going to make money to live? Vail Resorts is going to have to keep these workers around paying them to do nothing. 

MTN is going to take an ice cold bath this winter.

&#x200B;

Now let’s pretend in a fairytale world no shutdown comes and Trump finds those 650,000 missing votes. Vail is going to thrive right? Well I wouldn’t be wasting my time here on you idiots if that were true. 

&#x200B;

**Impact on Revenue During 2020-2021 Ski Season**

There are three major issues with Vail making money this year and those are mountain capacity limits, concession sales, and Epic Pass carryover. 

&#x200B;

Mountain Capacity Limits

Vail is implementing a reservation system to get on the mountain. If you hold an Epic Pass you can reserve a number of ski days. Breckenridge is already capping the mountain and we are only in the early ski season. You cannot reserve a spot for Friday and Sunday this week. Even more Vail is ONLY ALLOWING EPIC PASS HOLDERS on the mountain right now. On December 8th, lift pass holders will be able to make reservations. With only early season Epic Pass holders they are hitting capacity. They have not released how many people they will be allowing on their mountains but this is a telling sign.

&#x200B;

Concession Sales

There will be no indoor dining. Only to-go options will be available. No beer sales. They’re even encouraging skiers to bring their own food. 

&#x200B;

Epic Pass Carryover

2020-2021 Epic Pass holders were allowed to transfer their pass to 2021 with no charge. Epic Pass holders account for 50% of sales each year. If you listen to their investor call, half of that is already in their bank account from being carried over. Epic Pass riders are already capping Breck so how will people buy lift passes? How are they going to make money?

&#x200B;

If any of you even could read I doubt you made it to here anyways. Back in March this thing crashed 50% to $135/share. The market overreacted but my opinion this stock is going to fall to similar levels at some point this winter. They lost out on 1 month of revenue last year (mid-March to mid-April) post lockdown. This year they are looking at a lockdown at the BEGINNING of their ski season rather than the end. If the stock went down to $135 after the March lockdown, where will it go if they miss December through April of revenue this year?

**Intro**

TL;DR for Intro,

\- RKT lends money to people, primarily, but not restricted to, mortgages

\- I think RKT is going to start an uptrend very soon

Rocket Companies, Inc. Negative sentiment towards this stock is prolific on WSB, yet fear not, fellow autists, for I am here to break down this company and let you know how to make some sweet (maybe slow) tendies. Mortgages, we all need them. RKT does them, but they have recently branched out into other forms of lending to include personal lending and auto sales. Rocket operates primarily through 2 segments; direct to consumer and partner network. Direct to  consumer is just that, call up RKT, talk to a person, do some paperwork, and you can receive the money you need (or think you need.) The partner network uses the “Rocket Pro” platform to support clients with a “superior” experience, taking advantage of modern technology to make complex lending problems simple (for people who require a large number of mortgages and the management of those mortgages).

I think RKT is going to go up. I’ll explain why in the next sections.

Positions: short (3) 12/18 $20.00 puts and long 100 shares. Want to be assigned below $25 on 300 more shares. Price target $45 by December 31, 2021 (I’m Theta Gang, going to wheel).

**Technical Analysis**

TL:DR for TA

\- RKT had a pump and dump during IPO

\- RKT had a massive buy back of 30 mil shares from 1-5 Oct

\- RKT RSI 14 is 11.21, oversold

Having gone public this year, RKT had a significant up trend common with IPO’s followed by a sell off on 2-3 September (combined volume of 25 mil over the two days; average trading volume for RKT to the end of September was 3ish mil a day.) This sell off dropped the price from its ATH of $33.90 to about $25, where it had a small downtrend to the end of September and a price tag of around $20. Pump and dumps are incredibly common on stocks during IPO, and often it takes a while for the stock to stabilize. Here’s where things get juicy, from 1-5 Oct there were about 12.5 mil shares purchased in bulk.

RKT has been undergoing a consolidation and I believe that its done. RKT RSI 14 is sitting at 11.21 at the time of writing, indicating a supremely oversold stock. Look at Figure 1, all of these things discussed are there. I used Robinhood, you’re welcome.

&#x200B;

Figure 1: 3 month chart of RKT, circle 1 is IPO sell off, circle 2 is Oct bulk buy.  RSI is bottom orange line, very low at time of writing.

That’s about all the TA I’m going to do, I don’t believe in micro level TA.

**Fundamentals**

TL;DR for Fundamentals

\- RKT did very well on their 10Q, but hard to compare as its their first one

\- Mortgage and refinance demand is higher YoY than 2019 as a result of low rates

\- Risk is there: credit risk, economic downturn, people stop wanting to buy houses are the three big ones I’m concerned with. Credit Risk is what RKT is concerned with (according to the 10Q).

*The Quarterly Report*

RKT released its first quarterly report ending on 30 September 2020. One must be weary when reading a first report because there is little to compare to, BUT, might as well. All the numbers were absolutely astonishing. The YoY growth was incredible when compared to their claimed values from last year. Read the below statistics in (4) columns: Stat, September 30, 2020: December 31, 2019: % change. (in thousands, except %, that is just %)

\- Cash and Cash Equivalents: $3,485,137: $1,394,571: 150% increase

\- Total Assets: $37,752,829: $20,122,846: 87.6% increase

\- Total Liabilities: $31,392,093, $16,607,291: 89.0% increase

Read below in (4) columns: Stat, 9 months ending in 30 September 2020: 9 months ending in 30 September 2019: % change. (in thousands, except %, that is just %)

\- Net gain on sales of Loan: $10,856,135: $3,399,941: 219% increase

\- Total Expenses: $4,393,365: $3,041,945: 44.4% increase

\- **Net Income: $6,558,512: $$142,964: 4,487% increase**

\- Net Cash Used in Operating Activities: ($3,661,620): (5,901,871): 37.9% decrease

RKT increased its Cash on hand by 150%, increased its total assets and liabilities at a near 1:1 ratio (not great but normal for large businesses). The second set of stats is the interesting YoY stuff, from Jan to 30 Sep in 2020, they increased their Net Gain on Sales of Loan by 219% and they’re NET INCOME BY 4,487% as a result of limiting the increase of their expenses to only 44.4% all while decreasing Net Cash Used in Operating Activities by 37.9%. SO. If what they put on their balance sheet is true then they’re business is simply exploding.

On November 10,2020, the board of directors approved a share repurchase program, authorizing (but not requiring) the Company to repurchase outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock, of any Class, not to exceed $1 billion. This is in effect for 2 years. (THIS DOES NOT MEAN IT IS GOING TO HAPPEN, IT MEANS IT COULD HAPPEN.)

*The Market*

Transitioning from the 10Q to the market. Mortgage demand increased during the COVID-19 pandemic ([https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/03/mortgage-demand-from-homebuyers-spikes-18percent.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/03/mortgage-demand-from-homebuyers-spikes-18percent.html)), being 17% HIGHER in May then in April. People began to take advantage of the COVID-19 interest rates to take out new mortgages ([https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200703005149/en/Number-of-Mortgage-Applications-Increases-due-to-COVID-19-Implications---ResearchAndMarkets.com](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200703005149/en/Number-of-Mortgage-Applications-Increases-due-to-COVID-19-Implications---ResearchAndMarkets.com)). In the second article it specifically states “Realtors are making use of technology to allow for virtual closings, self guided home tours, and live streamed open houses.” NOW, the reverse side of the coin, a Nov 11 2020 CNBC article ([https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/11/mortgage-demand-from-homebuyers-drops-to-lowest-level-in-6-months.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/11/mortgage-demand-from-homebuyers-drops-to-lowest-level-in-6-months.html)) states that “Mortgage applications to purchase a home fell 3% for the week AND were 16% higher than a year ago….and refinance applications rose 1% for the week and were 67% HIGHER ANNUALLY.” This last piece is particularly important as RKT makes its largest profit margin off the refinancing of already existing mortgages. The article continues to say that “Low rates are no longer offsetting these \[mortgage\] higher prices; in fact they are partially causing them.”

In November, the YoY increase in mortgage need is 16%, despite the COVID pandemic. Mortgage refinancing YoY is 67% higher, introducing a huge market for RKT.

Finally, opinion time, COVID-19 validated RKT main business model by proving that real estate buying and selling can be accomplished almost entirely online. Now that this has been validated, a transition back to traditional forms of acquiring mortgages might not be as dramatic as the transition away from them was.

*Risk Management*

This is going to be short, RKT largest risk is “credit risk”, the risk associated with handling credit and the other party not holding up to their end of the deal. RKT mitigates this by selling around 70% of their mortgages while only managing about 30%, with an average hold time of about 18 days.

Next, a large economic downturn happens similar to 2008. This is unpredictable and is a risk in all businesses.

Finally, people stop wanting to buy houses. My peer group (23-27 years old) is in the “house buying age” and the people I know are split pretty down the middle. Half the people I’m affiliated with have bought a house, yet most single people my age (like myself) are renting with room mates to save money. This risk exists, I can’t predict what will happen, but this is the Panda thinking out loud.

**Conclusion/Disclaimers**

RKT lends people money, have been expanding their business model, and mortgage and refinancing demand are both higher YoY despite the pandemic. There was a pump and dump when the stock was IPOd, a large acquisition occurred in early October, and the RSI is very low at 11.21. RKTs balance sheet looked good \*with caution as there is nothing to compare it to\*. Very bullish, goal is to be assigned below $25 via shortting puts, wheel to price target of $45 dollars by December 31, 2021.

Pretty lines on a chart that show we’re still going UP UP UP!! Good news everybody! The market has experienced two Browning Slopes since mid-September. 

**The Fuck’s a Browning Slope?**

A Browning Slope is a nerdy complicated math thing that I won’t explain because you don’t actually care and won’t understand it anyway. What matters, and what you should care about, is that when these typically innocuous events are followed by a few sideways or slightly red weeks (what I call a “Slight Slide”) they start to indicate the market is setting up a pretty damn bullish scenario. 

When we see *two* of these Browning Slope + Slight Slide cycles *within a 3 month window* they are almost *always* followed by a nice solid growth period lasting a few months. How can I be so sure? Well, guess what dingus? IT ALREADY HAPPENED ONCE THIS YEAR. After the 'Rona crash we saw two of these cycles and the July/August rally came right after. I drew a picture for those of you who ate the scratch n sniff books as a kid:

[\(Insert random \\"this is not investment advice\\" disclaimer here.\)](https://preview.redd.it/szxv21crt8061.jpg?width=1276&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bdd6c5f1e2aa39461d60486693a0d640b24573e9)

**What does it mean for me today?**  
It means we are currently 3/4 of the way through the setup to a bull’s dream. If another Slight Slide happens, we should be on the train to Tendie Town. Now, if you’ve made it this far you might have actually done a little bit of your own research and Googled “Browning Slope” and realized it’s just that: BS. I made it up. Anyone can draw red and green lines connecting candles and claim it’s a crystal ball. But it’s not. It’s a bunch of horse shit. These people are predicting all sort of events and they’ll *eventually* be right but like my deaf uncle says “Even a blind squirrel nuts every once in a while.” The truth is that no one really knows what is going to happen next until it's already happening. And anyone claiming they do is usually trying to sell you something, like VZ FDs.

* It's oversold and PE ratio is low (30) compared to some comparable companies (amazon is at 90)
* IV is also relatively low compared to others in the sector 
* As soon as the Ant IPO is back on we're back to where we were near the $300+ mark

Really weird that their vaccine efficacy jumps 6% within days after a competitor comes out with a better efficacy rate. No I don't have empirical proof of my claim, but I'm sure I am not alone in saying this. The efficacy rate you tell the whole world (which Pfizer and BioNtech said was 90%) is the single most important number when it comes to giving vaccine news to the world. How, when a competitor (Moderna) comes out with a 94.5% efficacy rate, does Pfizer's 90% become 95-96%. Logically, they are lying because the efficacy rate is not a number which can change 5/6 % all of a sudden. Thats the most important number, and it should be right the first time. You don't have to believe me, but this has BS written all over.

Edit: ok, the efficacy can change, but it’s really suspicious for it to change so much in such a short span of time.

Sellers enrolled in managed payments are not allowed to list the following items:

* Gift cards & coupons
* Lodging, timeshares, vacation packages, and car rentals
* Memberships for campground and RV parks
* Motor vehicles
* Tickets for travel, events, or experiences
* Wine  


This is set to roll out in 2021 and unless something changes Ebay is essentially banning the above categories on their site. I know their is a good volume of Bullion and Coins that move through the site not to mention Motor vehicles is an easy revenue stream for them.

Let’s fkn go._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ GME Bull Case Mid-November 2020 This is rather going to be summary of what happened to GME.

1.The smartest autist in the world Dr. Michael Burry is still in the game and in June this year, he voted to back the board.

>"Scion believes CEO George Sherman, appointed by the Board in 2019, is progressing quickly in reshaping GameStop to thrive into and beyond the coming console upgrade cycle. Scion believes that under Sherman, GameStop is approaching its own reboot in a sensible and innovative manner. Scion noted that Sherman, along with CFO Jim Bell, have revamped working capital management for improved efficiency. Most crucially, it appears to Scion that GameStop is now succeeding in transforming vendor partnerships to unlock high-margin revenue streams. Scion believes that this is a direct result of current management's expertise and focus and is a complete gamechanger for GameStop beyond the coming console upgrade. "

Basically he says new board is adaptable to change and he believes current board can "reboot" Gamestop.

2. Ryan Cohen- the guy who beat amazon by selling dog and cat supplies, sent angry letter to Gamestop board to adapt to new era of digital gaming this week. He acknowledges that with the console cycle, Gamestop will have better revenue streams. However, he calls the board members to close the non-profitable stores and adapt to new era of gaming.

He ended the letter with urging board members to quickly announce roadmap for future.

>" In this spirit, we urge you to quickly provide stockholders with a credible and publicly-available roadmap for cost containment, prioritizing profitable retail locations and geographic markets, and building the e-commerce ecosystem gamers deserve. "

And Ryan Cohen is a bad motherfucker who turns stone into gold.

>"I look at almost everything that comes to me, but I say no to 99.9% of it. That was true at Chewy too in terms of just programming all of our executives that generally the best answer is no. As Warren Buffet says, the difference between successful and really successful people is really successful people say no all the time."

This dude saw Gamestop and he saw potential. And we have this guy on our side. His fund owns 9.98% share of Gamestop.

If coherent roadmap is announced soon, it will open big bull case for Gamestop's future. Most likely, they will have official communication on their earnings day when announcing their guidance.

3. Mobile gaming. Ryan Cohen mentions huge mobile gaming market in his letter to Gamestop board.

>"The explosion of mobile. "

Gamestop is aware of this and they are trying to create community of mobile gamers. Recently, they've partnered with Niantic to attract Pokemon Go players.

4. Partnership with Microsoft . It's a developing story, we do not know full details of the deal. However, it's been rumored that Gamestop will help Microsoft to sell more Microsoft products through their stores (Gamestop has around 5000 stores). And Microsoft will give portion of their digital sales to Gamestop on Xboxes purchased from Gamestop. I think this is honorable attempt to rob some PS5's market share.

[Source: Gamestop partnership with Microsoft](http://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-announces-multi-year-strategic-partnership-microsoft)

5. Undervalued on paper.

>"GameStop has over $5 a share in net cash and over $12 a share in cash, making it an extremely undervalued security given expected positive future cash flows from the next generation console cycle. "

Source: Seeking Alpha (reddit won't let me link seekingalpha)

6. Short Squeeze.

Well fuck this. Y'all know all the itty bitty about this, and read how it could shoot GME to the Mars like SpaceX.

Personally, I think any good news, any growth opportunity will shoot the stock up, and there are too many potential catalyst.

**5x NKLA 25p 12/31**  
**4x NKLA 25p 1/15/21**_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Another quick options trade with EOLS I told you all about CORT yesterday and we broke the system. Now it's time to do the same with EOLS.

Evolus is a biotech company that makes fancy name-brand botox. Sensible people have been shying away from voluntary medical medical procedures like botox injections, as they have been hit hard by the virus. We aren't sensible people.

H.C. Wainwright has the stock listed as a buy with a price target of $8, the average target prices I have found so far has been $9. The target price range has been from $5-$13.

None of that matters because we are focused on options. The $3 11/20 put option has a premium currently at $.25

For people who don't know what they're doing, that makes the cost basis $2.75 per share. So long as it stays above 2.75 you'll make money off of the trade. If it dips below that price you get 100 shares of a high potential growth stock, or you use cash to close the contract. **Selling puts doesn't leave you completely broke if you're wrong**

There are legitimate concerns that an influx of retards from this sub can ruin the option price. And since it is a small company, they could even potentially ruin the immediate stock value. In that case go for the December ($.20) or January ($.35) $2 puts. They are much safer as $2 would represent a new 52 week low for the stock.

**TL:DR** Sell EOLS $3 11/20 puts for an immediate risky play, or $2 12/18 / $2 1/15 for a safe bet that's hedged against the WSB retards. Stock also has potential but that shit is boring

The stupid ass SEC isn’t going to imprison him he’ll be fine._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ What did you degenerates do to my bud. _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ S&P Inclusion and the TSLA Hug of Death Listen up kids,

If you haven't noticed, TSLA is on a moon mission, even as we speak. While this is nothing new for our favorite meme stock, this price movement has insanely strong support.

**Catalyst:**

TSLA Inclusion in the S&P effective 12/21.

**What this means:**

Funds that track the S&P, with NAV in the multiple trillion collectively, need to come up with a collective **122 Million shares of TSLA** which as of this post was the equivalent of **$60B of buying pressure** by their respective inclusion deadlines.

**Why this is a big deal:**

TSLA is nearly a 560B Market cap company. It isn't your typical inclusion. This is why the announcement to include them came out *5 weeks* before their inclusion date, instead of the 3-10 days we typically see.

Most index funds tracking the S&P do not purchase these shares until the several days surrounding inclusion. Usually +/- 3 days on either end, so in this case 12/21 (so 12/15-12/24). This is the case in the prospectus of your boy SPY, while VFINX is deliberately vague on the topic. Just these two funds will need more than **$12B of TSLA shares** to get their AUM to reflect the new S&P accurately.

The free float of TSLA is about **16% of all shares**. TSLA only has ~**970M shares outstanding** meaning that only **155M are being actively traded**. You may recall from earlier that these funds will ultimately need about 122M. This means that the indexes ultimately need to end up with an *incredible* % of the free float in their bagholding hands by 12/21. This is going to create buying pressure the likes of which you have never seen. Traders seeking to squeeze the indices will simply buy TSLA up as high as they can, fully aware that the indexes will have to purchase from them in Dec. This will cause the stock to temporarily go *very, very, high*.

**What can go wrong?**

1. The S&P inclusion committee is aware that this might happen. They know it is a problem. They have said as much. They have solicited feedback from the finance community, and depending on what they hear they might decide to modify how they include TSLA, making a break from how they typically perform inclusions. They may ultimately decide to include TSLA in multiple tranches, breaking the necessity of buying for these indices into more than one wave, and taking a shot at the Dec squeeze thesis.

2. The committee or major institutions may press Elon to perform another massive share issuance. This would lesson the buying pressure by dramatically increasing the float. Recall that a $5B offering would result in an increase of 10M plus shares at the moment, or an increase in the float of something 8%+, resulting in the pressure being lessened. This seems unlikely given that TSLA has tons of cash and the index has publicly snubbed TSLA once before.

3. Most funds allow for wiggle room in their purchasing strategy, allowing them to hold derivative contracts in lieu of shares, or to materially differ from the index they track if an unusual situation causes shares to become unattainable or impractical. This would most likely be one of those situations. If squeezed extremely hard, most major funds would seek any and every remedy they could to avoid the window of death mentioned earlier.

**Conclusion:**

Buy 12/24 expiry call contracts for TSLA, and sell them Friday 12/18, when funds get squeezed the absolute hardest. Keep eyes peeled for any of the above risks, and be prepared to adjust down your strikes or ditch. Barring these risks becoming realized we should see a bull run on TSLA that lasts nearly a full month, and I personally imagine it could crack $600 before a steep retreat.

What's going on lol_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Special Situations Play Fellow retards, I present to you a special situations play unfolding on a Canadian casino operator. 

TL;DR-Great Canadian Gaming (GC- TSX) had an unsolicited bid by Apollo to take private, it’s going to be rejected due to the lack of process that was ran. Expect Apollo’s bid to be upped or they run a real process and multiple contenders come in. Given this April OTM calls offer a very strong risk-reward.  

Great Canadian Gaming (GC- TSX) is a casino operator that is beaten up but in a healthy position to outlast the off and on closures with a vaccine on the way. They were trading in the mid 20’s and Apollo came in with an unsolicited bid for the company at $39. 

This was presented just prior to the Q3 earnings and discussed with shareholders on the call. 

On the Q2 earnings call the CEO was extremely bearish on their outlook causing the stop to drop into the 20’s. This despite the company having positive EBITDA due to the operating nature of casinos in Canada (Government reimbursements for CapEX, etc). This caused some to question when Apollo approached the company and if there are some nefarious dealings going on. 

The vote is on December 23rd. Shareholders were vocal in the Q3 earnings call they were not taking this, they feel it's dramatically undervalued. Management wanted to take it despite having run no process for the company. There is a misalignment of incentives, minus the CEO board owns less than 0.5% of the stock and the CEO gets a $30m payday on his options if it goes through. 

There is a strong risk-reward play in April OTM calls. Here are the scenarios for these calls to pay off. 

1. Apollo ups their bid

2. Another contender comes in and starts a bidding war (Brookfield, the worlds second-largest asset manager is already a JV partner with GC on several casinos) 

3. The deal could fall through and no one else could show up to bid. With April calls if this deal falls through there is a good chance the stock recovers by then and is back in the 40’s as it was pre-covid. The pre-covid stock price was low for such a great company, they had a large amount of CapEx on the books from the construction of new casinos and they had not yet opened. Those casinos are now finished and all they have to do is open the doors. 

It’s also worth noting that Canada is currently set to start receiving vaccine doses in January. The CEO has previously said the casinos are cash flow positive with just 50-60 patrons inside. 

Here are some noteworthy moments from the Q3 earnings call. 

Lastly, I feel this is a great opportunity, that does not present itself very often. But do you own DD, I am long GC.

Hello again. SVM/??? here with another fuckin banger. LET'S GOOOO!!!!!

# Introduction:

The market is going to tank. Let me just give a bit of background so you know why my opinion is better than yours...

I am not a bear. I am not a bull. I go where the market tells me to go, I bet where it tells me to bet. And right now, the indicators are telling me to take a strong bearish position. So that's what I have been doing.

I've been trading more than 20 years. I was trading the great financial crash while most of you were watching fucking Spongebob or whatever the fuck you kids jerked it to. This is not my primary job, but I make a good deal of cash on the side every month, timing the market and swing trading broad market ETFs. I do my research, I know my shit, and I rarely touch your shitty meme stocks. I'm doing you all a favor of once again sharing my insights into this market, so you too can share in my profits and maybe learn a thing or two.

I will lay this out as cleanly as I can, offering multiple premises for my bearish bet and explaining them in detail. I've covered some of this in the past, but wanted to consolidate everything and more in one place. **This post will be long. If you want to cry about that rather than thank me for my service, you will go broke soon and deserve it cuz you are a lazy fuck.** PRESSING FORWARD!

&#x200B;

**Primary Bearish Premises:**

**Premise 1: The Market is Massively Overvalued (Macro)**

**Premise 2: SPY is Topping Off and Running on Vaccine Fumes (TA)**

**Premise 3: The Fed CANNOT Print Money You Retards (Facts)**

**Premise 4: Quantitative Easing is Deflationary (Theory)**

**Premise 5: Credit Markets are Contracting (Data)**

**Premise 6: Banks are Loading Up on Safe Bonds While Retail Loads Up on Stocks (Data)**

**Premise 7: Unemployment is Still Sky High (Data)**

&#x200B;

# Premise 1: The Market is Massively Overvalued

There are plenty of small, detail arguments for a bearish position. Covid cases rising, election uncertainty, stimulus failing, and so on. Plenty of others have made this case, so I won't focus on the small scale issues such as these.

What I want to give you is a larger, macro picture. Because the market is simply overvalued, period. The market has become divorced from the overall economy. I understand tech, and why they have a bullish case for growth in the face of Covid lockdowns... My point here is that you need some REAL WORLD measures to tie "future earnings" down to reality, to prevent irrational euphoria from taking over your mind.

There are plenty of indicators out there showing that stocks are overvalued. We could talk about insane P/E ratios, about euphoric meme stock flops like NKLA, and so on. The metric I'm going to present here is not new by any stretch. It isn't unique or original. But it is undeniably useful, and carries strong weight, whether modern traders wish to shun it and its originator or not. I'm talking about the Buffet Indicator.

https://preview.redd.it/oem2uhz714061.png?width=1008&format=png&auto=webp&s=b1f7e97544eba52859b986af68b4b80556660e43

For those of you new to this concept, it is simply the total stock market valuation divided by GDP. The point is to compare total market valuations with some hard, trailing, real-world metric, in this case GDP. When market valuations uncouple strongly from actual market conditions, it is a strong signal of irrational stock valuations. And that presents opportunity for those paying attention.

Note that **this chart has already been detrended down to account for historically rising P/E ratios**, and it still shows a strongly overvalued market, equal to what was seen during the DotCom bubble. That's bad news, folks.

This is the REAL issue in the present market, and why buyers are becoming exhausted. Covid, instability, elections, stimulus... These are all just catalysts to give that equity bubble a little prick. Only the dumbest of the dumb are still "buying the dip" under current market conditions, which means mostly clueless retail gamblers on WSB. All these perma-bulls are doing is offering liquidity to the institutional investors to help get them out of their positions. In the end, we all know who is left holding the bag.

# Premise 2: The Market is Topping Off and Running on Vaccine Fumes

I'm not a big believer in technical analysis. Most of it is bullshit, astrological voodoo if you ask me. But some of it works, and when technical analysis works, it is simply being used as a proxy for assessing market sentiment and emotions. Let's take a closer look at the teaser SPY chart I posted above.

https://preview.redd.it/h0ndq2a914061.png?width=1808&format=png&auto=webp&s=3fe30a5ad23952719c69c6634debe7fe8c0832af

As you can see, the market has been repeatedly rejecting multiple new highs. This process was briefly interrupted by positive vaccine news. We breached a new high on Pfizer vaccine results, but even that new high was instantly rejected and resulted in a sudden reversal selloff. The Moderna vaccine news created another short rally, lower than the Pfizer high, and that too was followed by a selloff. **In other words, the market is continually rejecting current market valuations.** As they should be, if you were following the point above. We are running on vaccine news fumes, and those will not last long. If you develop an instinct for these things, you can almost feel it in your gut: The market WANTS to head down.

If this isn't the top, it is close to it. $366.77 will very likely be the high for SPY for the year, and will soon unwind downwards.

# Premise 3: The Fed CANNOT Print Money

I know this will come as a shock to most of you idiots but the fucking money printer does NOT GO BRRRRR.

The Fed has to follow the laws that govern it's actions. The Fed does not have the legal authority to simply print cash and hand it out. Go ahead and read the Federal Reserve Act, and take a look at the Fed's actions, for proof of this. It doesn't even have the authority to print cash to buy corporate bonds or anything else.

What the Fed "prints" is called "reserves."

[ Source: https:\/\/www.stlouisfed.org\/open-vault\/2019\/august\/open-market-operations-monetary-policy-tools-explained](https://preview.redd.it/8ibo0kud14061.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=626a1464cd76296ee9d435a5c69f182e4286f9d6)

So what, you say? So everything. The key point about reserves is that they cannot be spent like cash can. When a bank gets reserve funds in its reserve account at the Fed, it CANNOT SPEND that money. All the bank can do is use that account as collateral to lend against. Which means **if the banks are not lending, those QE funds are NOT entering the economy.** They might as well not exist. And banks are not lending, as we will see below.

This is the counter argument to all the ignorant retail traders who will argue that the Fed is "backstopping" stocks, or that the Fed will not "allow" the market to crash. The Fed has no power to print money, and therefore no power to buy stocks, and therefore no power to prevent a crash. The Fed's power is illusory, but enough people buy the illusion to make it effective. That won't last forever.

Just think about it. If Fed actions and QE really made stocks rally the way people claim it does, why isn't the Japan Nikkei constantly breaking new all time highs???

# Premise 4: Quantitative Easing is Deflationary

Quantitative Easing is not Cash. In fact, QE is deflationary.

Here is how QE works, in a nutshell. The Fed buys bonds from the big banks. Except the Fed isn't buying them with cash. In exchange for the bonds, the Fed puts funds in a reserve account held by the bank. These reserve funds CANNOT BE TOUCHED by the banks. All the banks can do is use this account as collateral to lend against.

In fact, it's worse than that. Because the Fed is removing assets from the open market, and not paying cash for them. It is purchasing liquid assets with illiquid reserves. Despite all the Fed's talk about "creating liquidity," what the Fed is actually doing is REMOVING liquidity from the system!

Why would they do this? Answer: To lower interest rates. Don't take my word for it, the Fed explains this itself!

[ Source: https:\/\/www.stlouisfed.org\/open-vault\/2019\/august\/open-market-operations-monetary-policy-tools-explained ](https://preview.redd.it/bzl5jfpf14061.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=b4c96c8e3b741867281f43b5472c634c85cba5bf)

See, the Fed has to follow the laws that govern its actions. Despite what the public believes, the Fed does not have the legal authority to simply print money and hand it out. The Fed knows that the true source of inflation in a debt-based economy is through **credit expansion.** So the Fed does everything it can to reduce interest rates, both by setting reserve rates near zero and by using QE to drive rates down further.

Only when credit expansion revives will we begin to see inflation and a true recovery. The Fed knows their hands are tied, which is why they keep hammering Congress to pass more stimulus.

Perhaps the greatest strength of the Fed is in "forward guidance." The Fed simply uses words to convince the public that money is being printed, that inflation is coming, so that people go out and spend and buy assets. They are playing a trick on the public, and the trick is working. People actually believe inflation is coming, that stocks are being held up by the Fed, that money is pouring into the system. The public is wrong on every count.

The Fed is trying to contract credit markets in order to lower interest rates in order to eventually spur lending in order to eventually create inflation. But in the meantime, QE is deflationary. As stated above, if reserve funds are not being lent out by the banks, they do not enter the economy, and thus QE serves a deflationary role. Let's take a look at the next premise, that banks are contracting the credit markets.

# Premise 5: Credit Markets are Contracting

The question of whether banks are lending or not with their QE reserves is simply a matter of looking at the data. Practically every data source we can point to suggests contracting credit conditions. This means QE reserves are not entering the economy, and therefore are not producing inflation nor holding up stocks.

**The SLOOS data from the Fed, Oct. 2020:**

Real Estate lending is booming, you say? Not so....

**Banks Lending is TIGHTENING:**

Note: The decline near the end doesn't represent growth in credit, but represents a reduction in the RATE of tightening.

**Consumer Demand for Loans is SHRINKING:**

**Even Credit Card debt growth is negative!**

# Premise 6: Banks are Loading Up on Safe Bonds While Retail Loads Up on Stocks

If you are like me, you look forward to the H.8 data every Friday from the Fed (yeah right haha). A continuing trend in that data, month after month after month, is that major banks in the US have been loading up on bonds with no end in sight. They are piling more and more cash into safe assets, now up to a whopping $4.6 TRILLION in securities.

[Source: https:\/\/www.federalreserve.gov\/releases\/h8\/current\/default.htm](https://preview.redd.it/tn38ss3p14061.png?width=1219&format=png&auto=webp&s=7dc1c06695685a883599315abc9e36047128e687)

Meanwhile, retail traders (that means you) keep piling into stocks at all time highs. A record amount of cash was dumped into the market after the vaccine news breaks. I'm just gonna go ahead and call it now. This is the top.

[Source: https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2020-11-13\/stock-funds-get-record-44-5-billion-inflows-on-vaccine-optimism](https://preview.redd.it/xogj0z2q14061.png?width=1314&format=png&auto=webp&s=c466b29277d6f047781fd9156bd476b3b1c011f1)

# Premise 7: Unemployment is Still Sky High

I bring this up just to reiterate another real-world metric that is gloomy as fuck and yet completely ignored from market valuations. Why are stocks breaking all-time highs when we still have MILLIONS more unemployed than we did this time last year? Hello McFly?

https://preview.redd.it/jda435zq14061.png?width=1164&format=png&auto=webp&s=3929064c0e9d6ae120201ad4295e02cca2bdcf45

# Conclusion:

**Shit's fucked up son.** Real world economy is still in shambles. Market is more overvalued than it was during the DotCom boom. Still millions unemployed. The market is topping off and rejecting highs again and again. The Fed is not printing money and not backstopping assets, despite claims to the contrary. We are heading down, folks!

**Positions:**

**SPY 350p 12/18**

**VXX 22c 12/18**

Also anything else that strikes your fancy. IWM, GLD, SLV puts are all fine (dollar is going to rise). Longer dated TLT calls will print as well due to QE reducing bond yields, eventually. Go longer or shorted dated depending on personal risk tolerance.

**Timing can be difficult. My strategy is to periodically enter bearish positions when short-term indicators look good, and hope to eventually time the major dump. If things begin to stabilize short-term I exit the position quickly with a small gain or, rarely, a small loss.**

Currently the stock is quite low most likely due to the low demand of Aluminum as there are full warehouses slowly emptying and also delays in production with COVID. However with the production of new lines of cars with a shifting market from diesel and gas engines towards EV and FCEV/FCV more car bodies will be produced. For example Tesla model S bodies are produced from 98% Aluminum.

This in effect with Americas Green Future plans means their new tech will be especially in demand. 

May be good long term hold.

We all know EV stocks are on fire right now.  Yet the pump has not been equally distributed.   We Americans need to drive cars because we've morbidly obese after slurping up tendies for every meal in our mom's basement.   So we forget that across most of Asia that scooters, not cars, are by far the most numerous type of vehicle.

Introducing NIU. this company is growing fast,  has the same governmental promotion for EVs, and doesn't have anywhere near the same valuation as LI, NIO, and XPENG.  Market cap is only 2.5 billion for over 450k electric scooter deliveries so far this year.   

You want growth?  This company is growing 40% YoY.  It gets better.  They're actually profitable despite being founded the same year as NIO.

Let's do some math.  Nio has 660m q3 revenue versus 100m q2 revenue for NIU.  Nio market cap is 60 billion versus 2.5 billion for NIU.  Let's be conservative and say the price/revenue multiple for NIU should be only half of NIO due to lower growth.  That means NIU should be worth 4.5 billion - 80% up from where it is now.  

As an extra bonus, Q3 earnings are expected Monday so it's time to load up before they smash expectations and rocket to the moon. This is as close as you can get to free tendies.

NIU 12/18 35C_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Hmm, should you buy TESLA 12/24 Calls at 600, 700, to the f*king moon strike prices? _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ DD: RIOT, MARA, MSTR and CAN Greetings, fellow autists, if you missed out on NIO and PLTR, here’s the next play! We’re riding the cribtoe wave this time. If you haven’t heard the news, shillcoin is close to reaching its 2017/2018 ATH, so instead of buying that shit coin ourselves, we’re playing companies with exposure to shillcoin.


**RIOT and MARA**: These two are involved in the shit coin mining business. As the price of shillcoin rises, so does their stock price... well that’s how it worked last time at least. If you refer back to shillcoin ATH and view the price of both tickers then vs. now, they clearly aren’t tracking the price as strongly. I’m going to chalken this up to the fact that there is less media hype surrounding shillcoin this time around. Last time when shillcoin peaked, RIOT was worth ~$30, now it’s only trading at $5. However, institutions are FOMOing into shill coin HARD recently. The shillcoin train is starting to leave the station and hype is mounting. If shillcoin breaks it’s previous ATH, you can expect MARA and RIOT to have an insane break out. 


**MSTR**: This one is slightly less risky, kinda. MSTR runs some sort of SaaS business and supposedly it’s pretty good. But their market cap is super small. The CEO is real big into the whole shillcoin stuff and has nearly $500,000,000 worth of shillcoin in the company’s cash reserve. This guy is probably more autistic than most of the fuckers on this subreddit, but I digress. When shillcoin moons, I expect the share price of MSTR to reach ~$300. 


**CAN** : Saving the worst for last, I present Canaan. CAN manufacturers shillcoin mining equipment. They also have received prior fraud allegations. They’re from China so you do the math. They haven’t been publicly traded for very long though and their currently down like 90% from ATH. Think of that retarded quote you always hear: “The gold miners didn’t get rich during the gold rush, the shovel salesmen did.”


TL;DR: Shares/calls on CAN, MSTR, RIOT and MARA.

What do you think?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ RKT - Tesla of mortgage industry Long time lurker, first time poster. Hope I meet the mark!!

Listen up retards! Some of you might have heard of Rkt mortgage. It had a hyped IPO in August at $18. Went up to 30+ in September with strong Q2 earnings and then down to 18 again in October. It's Q3 earnings were way above expectations of most analysts and even Jim Cramer recommended it a strong buy! (Link: [https://m.benzinga.com/article/18257619](https://m.benzinga.com/article/18257619))

Here's why Rocket can go 2x or more soon:

1. Rocket is just not another mortgage company. It is the biggest home mortgage player in US! Plus they are more of a Fintech company than a pure mortgage player. Just like Tesla used technology to make driving easier, Rocket technology makes the loan process simpler and faster!
2. Their Q2 and Q3 earnings were way above analyst expectations! Q4 will be bigger and better! Why? Read this: [https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2020/11/12/investing/rocket-mortgage-buy-home-real-estate/index.html](https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2020/11/12/investing/rocket-mortgage-buy-home-real-estate/index.html)
3. Realising the current price of their stock is too low, Rocket announced $1bn share buyback program. This will drive the share prices in near term! Link: [https://m.benzinga.com/article/18309890](https://m.benzinga.com/article/18309890)
4. Institutional ownership is just beginning to build-up for Rocket. Point72 (Steven Cohen) holds some minor stake in Rocket. More hedge funds are going to jump soon.
5. Finally, given the near zero interest rate environment, mortgage players like Rocket will continue recording major gains for next 1-2 years!!
6. Last bonus point (speculation and not confirmed) - Buffett recently filed 13f didn't include some of the stocks that he is secretly building a position. Rumours are that he is investing in Fintech company. Buffett is known to be investing early into companies and RKT might be part of his portfolio!!

Summary - Rocket will be $40+ or $50+ stock soon. Get in early , do your own research!

TLDR (for retards who can't read):

RKT 30c 18 Dec 20 (aggressive and retard play)

RKT 30c 19 Mar 21 (Safer and conservative play)

Edit for position update: holding 100 calls for 30c Dec 20 and 50 calls for 30c Mar21._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ For those who aren't already all in on GME, here's why you should start thinking about picking up a few shares Aside from everything else that's going on with GME right now, there's something interesting about the price movement.

After hours trading closed at $11.52 last night, and as of writing this the price is sitting at $12 in premarket trading with a total volume of **51** (in premarket). Even if we assume that all **51** shares were bought and none of those specific shares were sold, that's an increase of 4.17% from a mere **51** shares bought.

65 day average volume is 11+ million, yesterday's volume was 3+ million, yet the price is refusing to move past $12. That can only be explained by one thing. There is still a ridiculous amount of short selling happening. We need to buy and hold GME and lock up as many shares as possible. I'm seeing people almost every other day putting their life savings into GME * **after** * *doing their research*. If you look at everything going on with GameStop right now, without any sort of bias, I'm certain you will conclude that picking up at least a few shares of GameStop may be worthwhile.

The Big Short 2 incoming. Shorts are fucked.

Don't say we never told you.

Hope you enjoy it.

# TL;DR and Positions:

**This is a reasonably short-term bet that WYNN, which rose over 25% on vaccine news, is overextended and will pull back.**

* Dec 18 ’20 $75p and 85p
* Jan 15 ’21 $80p and $90p

https://preview.redd.it/vt2w0cvda6061.jpg?width=1242&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f13f6b240e8e72e55cce658080a23f21552763c9

# Thesis, for anyone interested:

This is partially a play on vaccine exuberance (targeting cyclical/reopening names), and partially a play on Wynn specifically

***Vaccine Exuberance***

* As everyone knows, Pfizer and Moderna have recently reported stellar efficacy data on their COVID-19 vaccines. Last week’s Pfizer vaccine pump, in particular, sent cyclical names (i.e. cruise lines, airlines, casinos, AMC, etc.) soaring.
* IMO, these names went too far ahead of themselves. It’s true that the strong data is a triumph for science and signals that there’s a light at the end of the COVID-19 tunnel. However, once the euphoria dissipates, we have to confront a basic truth-: the vaccine isn’t going to be widely available until sometime in 2Q 2021, possibly later.
* For context, PFE and MRNA will apply for Emergency Use Authorization (EUA), with an FDA decision expected sometime in December. But even if the FDA issues EUA, the limited doses of vaccines that are currently available will only be provided to very select populations, e.g. high-risk populations. Full approval (not EUA) for the vaccines are expected in 1Q 2021, meaning most people will not be getting vaxxed until next year.
* This means that in the short term, nothing about the cyclical names has fundamentally changed. Their businesses will continue to struggle, especially with the looming threat of additional stay-at-home orders. Further, those who have watched the market this year know that every subsequent vaccine news generally provides diminishing pumps (unless it's something new altogether, like the Pfizer/Moderna efficacy data). **I believe that the recent pump in the cyclicals was built on euphoria that will fade in the coming weeks.**

***Wynn***

* Disclaimer: if you think the thesis above makes sense, **you might also consider playing names like CCL and AMC**. I personally chose WYNN for a couple of reasons-:
* The stock has been hovering in the $70-75 range for a while (since April 8, it has closed below $70 only thrice). I consider the recent runup to $100+ way too much given that no material news was released by the company specifically.
* Nevada is having a hard time with covid right now. On Nov 10 Governor Sisolak advised citizens to stay at home for 2 weeks, giving them the [ultimatum](https://www.tahoedailytribune.com/news/sisolak-gives-nevada-2-weeks-to-get-virus-under-control/) that if things don’t get better, “I will be forced to take action in 14 days,” he said, although he mentioned that “I don’t want to take enforcement. I want to lift restrictions.”
* Yet the [usual facts abound:](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/nevada-coronavirus-cases.html) cases are at an all time high and continue to grow, while hospitalizations are rising as well. I expect that this trend continues post Thanksgiving.
* Clearly shutdowns and business restrictions are unpopular, but the [latest news](https://www.reviewjournal.com/news/politics-and-government/nevada/sisolak-restrictions-to-slow-spread-of-covid-19-coming-very-soon-2186014/) is that Sisolak might take some sort of action soon. **Any talk (or action, of course) of shutting casinos down may send Wynn spiraling back down.**
* (Sidenote: Puts on LVS, CZR, MGM seem viable too, but Wynn has run up the most)

***Several Counterarguments/Things That Can Derail This Trade***

* It is unclear that casinos will close down again. From the [same article](https://www.reviewjournal.com/news/politics-and-government/nevada/sisolak-restrictions-to-slow-spread-of-covid-19-coming-very-soon-2186014/): “in responding to other questions about potentially keeping casinos open, the governor said he doesn’t want to “shut down all of the economy if we can avoid it.”
* In fact, Sisolak has [encouraged tourists to continue coming to Nevada](https://news3lv.com/news/local/tourists-welcome-in-nevada-locals-asked-to-stay-home-for-two-weeks). There is pressure to keep businesses open, so he may not bend the knee for shutdowns.
* Additional good vaccine news (particularly an EUA approval) might send all the cyclical names rocketing up again, and Wynn would be no exception.
* J Pow turns on the money printer and massacres all puts.

***Positions***

* I’m thinking that a stream of bad news will overshadow the good news in the next few weeks. That said, December puts are a little risky because the timing will probably coincide with further good vaccine news, so slightly smaller positions here. The bulk of the position is in Jan puts as you can tell.
* For strikes, I just chose a few that make sense to me, along with a speculative $75p. I reinforce once again, with some exceptions, Wynn does not stay below $70 for long, so if the stock does drop bigly, I will be cashing out before it teases low $70's.

If you want to follow the conspiracy theories, follow yolocapitalmgmt on twitter. The co-founder of stripe began following him today because of all the attention the posts are getting. The co founder is a billionaire and he is following a degenerate from WSB that lives in his moms basement.

Small updates might just be coincidental: 

* T Rowe price has taken a large position, 
* Soroban capital has taken a large position.
* Bill Ackman sold some Hilton recently

Some more conservative plays: 

* Sell 25.00 puts - effective cost for psth would be 24.00 ish if assigned. a 2% discount compared to todays price.
* Wait for a pullback: I expect there will be at least one more small pullback.
* If FOMO is too strong, space your buys out.
*  Buy Deep itm leaps. 15c june expiration.

Retard plays: 

* Buy warrants
* buy deep OTM call options

This isn't investment advice, do your own research. Dont get FOMO and just be patient._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Karp Selling PLTR Shares (SEC Form 4) _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ All the DD you need on PLUG Power to know why it’s the best clean energy investment you can make First off, to get your attention, Blackrock has a Billion USD down on PLUG power. This company will be worth trillions by 2030

Understand that PLUG’s fuel cells already power thousands of commercial equipment such as forklifts and other supply chain hydraulic equipment. Seen a whole lot of people that think fuel cells don’t work, but I can assure you, it’s not the EV competitors that keep Elon Musk awake at night, it’s Andy Marsh and Plug Power. 

PLUG will be providing hydrogen units to power vehicles in the mid 2021, are prepared to assist OEM’s in installation and service (four major OEM’s confirmed and purchased). In other words, cars on the road in months, not years. But cars are just a side project for PLUG. 

That’s right, cars are not even the main focus of this company, they are about to control the whole green hydrogen supply chain, and I’m going to break it down for you simply. I’ve been periodically rolling over options since PLUG was at $6, and it’s going to be my early retirement. 

Here’s why: 

1) Hydrogen power allows for instant refueling, and is optimized for engine sizes on long distance hauling compared to electric- yep, this means clean energy that you don’t have to charge. This means hydrogen can be used for planes, and logistically is the best choice for trucking. 

2) Plug power doesn’t just do cars and engines they also control the refueling stations. They already have a refueling line all along the east coast of the US. For those that purchase their drive units. 

3) They are the the main processor and distributor of green hydrogen, and are investing highly in its production 

4) They have developed large scale commercial power stations (the size of a tennis court) that can generate enough energy to manage major data and cloud businesses. This is the first efficient and green independent energy source ever created. This could would allow you to put a Walmart in the Sahara Desert, and it also means you don’t need to run electrical utilities from the grid to the business. 


The Issues: 

1)first off understand that there is already electrical infrastructure across nearly the entire world. This is not a reality with hydrogen, which is why PLUG is so dedicated to building fueling stations right now. 

2) The next and main problem with PLUG power isn’t whether hydrogen works, it does, the problem is with making it a 100% clean energy, or green hydrogen. Right now most hydrogen comes from the separation and purification process of natural gasses, which is considered a dirty process, making that hydrogen not classified as green hydrogen. In order to achieve 100% green hydrogen, they must process hydrogen using solar and other forms of clean energy processes. PLUG and it’s associates in the sector must build a strong enough infrastructure in order to process and distribute enough green hydrogen to drop the price of clean hydrogen to a competitive price with other clean energy forms. 
Plug power is solving this, and well on its way to making, processing, and distributing enough clean hydrogen to drop the price of clean hydrogen to make it competitive with the price of electricity

With big moves being made to clean energy, PLUG is perfectly positioned and is a necessity for businesses that can’t stop moving to charge their equipment, and to get clean, commercial level power to areas that you can’t or isn’t financially feasible to run electrical utilities. Plug power is going to be one of the largest energy distributors in the world by 2030.  

They control nearly every bit of the process of bringing clean hydrogen to their own products, and control all the infrastructure. Best Buy you could ever make.

Here are my roll over positions, total of around 1300% : [Positions](https://imgur.com/gallery/HXqWcrn)

Edit of Edit: I’m not telling anyone that right now is the best time to buy weekly call options on PLUG. The reason I’m doing this is because I’ve come a crossed a variety of posts saying fuel cells don’t even work, along with a lot of incorrect, misinformation. I’m trying to explain simply what the company is doing outside of vehicles and because the engineering behind fuel cells, in addition to bringing hydrogen vehicles to the road is unquestionably more challenging then electric. However it actually opens up the ability for green aerospace, trucking and 24/7 commercial business.

All that glitters is gold
And she's buying a stairway to Heaven

If the stores are all closed
With a word she can get what she came for
Oh oh oh oh and she's buying a stairway to Heaven
  
 (She obviously thinks she’ll be able to YOLO it to the top) 


There's a sign on the wall
But she wants to be sure
'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings

(She’s on WSB daily to get her DD, trying to find the best play)


There's a feeling I get
When I look to the west
And my spirit is crying for leaving
In my thoughts I have seen
Rings of smoke through the trees
And the voices of those who standing looking

(China’s to the west of US... something about COVID)


And it's whispered that soon, If we all call the tune
Then the piper will lead us to reason
And a new day will dawn
For those who stand long

(YOLO all on NIO and go long)


And the forests will echo with laughter
If there's a bustle in your hedgerow
Don't be alarmed now
It's just a spring clean for the May queen

(People will die and in May we shall have the vaccine)

Yes, there are two paths you can go by
But in the long run

Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow?
And did you know
Your stairway lies on the whispering wind?

And as we wind on down the road
Our shadows taller than our soul
There walks a lady we all know 
Who shines white light and wants to show
How everything still turns to gold

(She goes long on NIO, and it moons $420)


And if you listen very hard
The tune will come to you at last
When all are one and one is all
To be a rock and not to roll
And she's buying a stairway to Heaven

(She diamond handed, held fast and didn’t roll out her YOLOs and is a WSBillionaire)

Curiosity Stream is the love child of Netflix and Animal Planet, a streaming platform that exclusively caters to documentary and factual content. I'll give you the bullet points on why this company will grow into a streaming heavy hitter in the next 2 years:

\-they've doubled revenue year over year for the past 2 years and they project they will do it again in 2021 with profitability in 2022

\-13 million subs and climbing, they did not update this number after Covid hit and I suspect that they are growing much faster while keeping it quiet (9 different execs filed form 4's early November if you know what I mean) 

\-one of the highest retentions of subscribers in the industry, people love the price compared to the content offered and much more often purchase a yearly package instead of the monthly, that's 11 fewer chances to unsubscribe

\-partnership with TataSky (Indian cable company) projects 20 million new potential subscribers

\-non-fiction content is cheaper to make compared to scripted content, this gives the company an edge on production value and content investment

\-factual content is uniquely attractive to advertisers because of its family-friendly nature

\-stacked executive team full of industry connections, the founder is John Hendricks

\-Mkt Cap of 400mil that's projected to grow to 10 billion potentially

\-Analyst price targets are favorable

**CNK**\- Cinemark is a movie theatre company and before you roll your eyes and scroll on, take a look because it has a lot more potential than you think. Cinemark owns theatres in 42 states and 16 countries totaling over 6,000 screens. Granted they are not being used right now but that is a lot of assets. For being shutdown, they are doing surprisingly well. They have more than enough cash on hand to last many more months and that is if they make no profits at all which is highly unlikely. Even if this were to last longer than their cash, they have very manageable debt and more than enough assets to cover it. The majority of their debt is long-term and most of it isn't even due until 2023 which gives them more than enough time to either roll it over or generate enough capital to pay it down. The positive information above isn’t even taking into account the [deal they just made](https://ir.cinemark.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/478/universal-filmed-entertainment-group-and-cinemark-theaters) with Universal (which includes DreamWorks) to release in their theatres for at least 3 weeks before they can release the movies anywhere else. This is fantastic news because it gives them exclusive access to the opening few weeks of any movie which historically is when they make their most money. 

What can you take away from this? This is a company that is being managed very well given the circumstances. Long term movie theatres are not going away. They may change but for many people, nothing beats going and seeing something on the big screen. Given the fact that AMC is gasping for air, CNK has the potential to become the leading movie theatre in the nation. To me, shares are the best idea. Long term and at this discount they will net you some good profits. But I know that's not how you fucks work, you want options. The [original poster](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jvxjpu/cinemarks_cnk_free_tendies/) advocated for 20c for 4/21 and 30c for 12/21 which is very reasonable. THIS IS A LONG TERM PLAY. For more info take a look at their [10-k](https://ir.cinemark.com/sec-filings/all-sec-filings/content/0001564590-20-005646/0001564590-20-005646.pdf) and previous [earnings](https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_529fa8877bd02a78fc90e3d84715e621/cinemark/news/2020-11-05_Cinemark_Holdings_Inc_Reports_Results_for_the_475.pdf).

**EBAY-** We all know eBay. A substantial online consumer sales company that has been around for years. What some of you don't know is that they are at 3-month lows GOING INTO BLACK FRIDAY. Are you fucking kidding me? An online store that makes money every Black Friday is down on a year where online shopping is at numbers never seen before in history? Seems like people are confused. Last year they made 2.8 billion in their [4th quarter](https://ebay.q4cdn.com/610426115/files/doc_financials/2019/q4/Exhibit-99.1-ER-eBay-Q4-2019_FINAL.pdf) which includes Black Friday and Christmas. Just last earnings (3rd Quarter 2020) they [reported earnings](https://ebay.q4cdn.com/610426115/files/doc_financials/2020/q3/Exhibit-99.1-ER-eBay-Q3-2020_FINAL.pdf) of **2.6 billion**. A quarter without Black Friday and Christmas made almost as much as they did last year doing those times. Using just 9 out of the total of 15 brain cells I have and a little bit of extrapolation, I can say that they are going to crush last year's Q4 numbers. [This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jwls84/ebay_call_the_safest_option_you_can_get/) has some more information you can take a look there and at the other links to further decide for yourself. OP says 55 or 60c for January 21 which seems like a safe bet, but if you want a shorter-term play, I would say around 49.5-51 for mid to late December would work just as well. This will be closing the holiday shopping season and locking in profits for eBay.

**HDS-** I'll just pull stuff straight from the [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jwk6iq/the_knock_off_home_depot/), 

>HD Supply is an industrial distributor in North America. Their revenue is 7.39 billion. Home Depot has decided to acquire it...

After news of the acquisition hit the price jumped to 55 from 44. Home Depot plans to acquire them for 56 a share cash. This news, however, disregards the fact that FOUR INDEPENDENT LAW FIRMS for possibly breaching their fiduciary duties or violating the federal securities laws in connection with the company’s acquisition by The Home Depot, Inc. Uh oh, that's not good. If these firms find anything, and they very well could, expect acquisition talks to breakdown completely and the stock price to tank. And guess what, they dropped a bit after market close as well. Watch the news closely because this is quite possibly a slamdunk for puts given how quickly the price rises and falls. The price may hover around 55 for a while given Home Depot but just watch. This could be a nightmare for both companies. Given all that, make sure you do a little of your own research. 

&#x200B;

**Knowledge-** Now back in May, I made [this post explaining how to play earnings](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ge06g7/how_to_play_earnings_like_youre_not_a_retard_tldr/) like you were not completely incompetent. There is a lot more that goes into it than just earnings. You also have to understand the psychology of the market which is really fucking difficult. We have all lost a shit ton of money because a company did good on earnings and the market decided it wasn’t good enough. Or they took a shit on earnings but not a huge shit and the market sent it to the moon. I have a bit of experience in this sector knowing quite a bit about mass psychology so if you would like a post similar to the earnings one about market psychology then let me know.

&#x200B;

That’s all I’ve got for today. Good luck fuckers and, for those of you that remember, instead of doing these summaries 3 times a week I will be doing them after market close on Wednesday and Sunday nights so that you can work through all the big words in your head before market open the next day.

&#x200B;

**TLDR;** Cinemark has a pretty good chance of pulling out of this a bigger player in the movie industry. eBay is undervalued given their extremely high likelihood of killing earnings and raking in cash because of the holiday season. HD Supply is being investigated and acquisition talks could take a turn for the worst. I know about market psychology, would you like to?

**Plays;** CNK 20c 4/21 or 30c 12/21, EBAY 55-60c 1/21 or 49-51c 12/20, HDS 55p 12/20 1/21 or 3/21 with 3/21 being the safest bet.

Sumo Logic (SUMO) 

Earnings date: 12/7 After Hours

Closing price (11/18): $19.01

https://preview.redd.it/dp2dkg2gw2061.png?width=1068&format=png&auto=webp&s=85327d356d29999fad27b8756a21635efa096ec7

Quick Facts:

* SUMO is growing quickly and is positioned well to compete in a $50B-$80B market.
* Cloud native DevSecOps platform is gaining more traction.
* \~8.2 P/S (significantly lower than competitors).
* Peaked at $28.45 right after IPO.
* CEO stated they are making progress with sales channels that are targeting CISOs (Chief information security officer) due to their holistic approach.  (Link to presentation at the bottom)
* Option volume is overwhelmingly bullish. 
* Tiger Global Management has an excellent track record or picking winners and they own over 5 million shares, which is \~5% of SUMO. (Take a look at their holdings, link at the bottom)

Cons:

* Article in Barron cited slowing growth due to shrinking IT budgets as a significant challenge for SUMO. 
* CEO leaves something to be desired. He has a good track record of positions, however, it seems that he has had a difficult time convincing Wallstreet. 
* SUMO has not received much press the last month. The market we are in feeds on press. 

&#x200B;

Final Thoughts:

SUMO is perfectly positioned for a run up to earnings. It is currently trading at a discount and could easily take off. Some respectable whales have taken large positions. Low public float (est. 50m shares) means that is could go up very quickly. It has strong revenue growth and has been significantly hurt by the little press that it has had. Analysts have price targets ranging from $24-31. If we see anything close to the post IPO price, this will be a big win. Any thoughts or additional DD will be appreciated!

&#x200B;

Scenario 1: SUMO gains over the next two week to $23-25. I will sell half before earnings in scenario 1.

Scenario 2: SUMO continues to trade flat between $18.75-$21.00. In this case I will hold through earnings but I will buy OTM 12/18 puts to hedge my calls.

Scenario 3: Flat until earnings, flat after earnings. Diamond hands through earnings. Sell for 50-60% loss. 

&#x200B;

TL;DR SUMO has earnings on 12/7. It is trading at a significant discount to its peers. A little bit of good press could send this thing up to $25+ before earnings. 

Position 12/18 $17.50C

At this level it’s definitely oversold and will be a good earnings run up. People are currently being frugal and spending less since no stimulus. Also, because of the riots some neighborhoods don’t have a Walmart or Target no more, especially in the poor ones. Poor people would rather buy stuff from dollar tree or even family dollar too. Looking back on previous earnings during this time November, it has always ran up. Just look at the chart📈. If it stays around this level tomorrow, I will be yoloing my whole account on this play. We finna go to the moon boisss🚀🌝🚀🌝🚀🌝

Getting the DLTR $96 Call 12/11_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ PYPL long, possibly retarded but YOLO **Note:** *This thread involves the discussion of PYPL future earnings based on sales of cryptocurrencies and is not meant to discuss cryptocurrency as an investment.* *No opinion is given on cryptocurrency itself, and it is purely being viewed as revenue growth for PYPL moving forward.*

Ok, so, I've been thinking about SQ revenue growth and comparing the numbers for PYPL and I need someone to convince me not to yolo a good chunk of my life savings on PYPL calls for June 2021. Here are some basic facts to look at.

* SQ has generated $1.63B in revenue from cryptocurrency sales in Q3 2020
* SQ has generated $32 million of gross profit from this cryptocurrency revenue
* SQ Q3 revenue was reported **before the massive cryptocurrency price rally** and Q4 revenue can be expected to be much higher

Seems simple enough to me that SQ can expect increased profits in Q4 with significant revenue growth directly correlating to increased volume in cryptocurrency markets. Now, for PYPL and my admittedly retarded ideas.

* PYPL launched a beta program to allow cryptocurrency purchases on a very limited amount of accounts
* Since the beta program launched, Paxos, the partnered exchange handling the actual sales of cryptocurrency through PayPal, has seen significant volume increase
* Daily volume on ItBit, the Paxos exchange, ranged from $3-8m on average before PYPL partnered with Paxos
* Daily volume on ItBit has now increased dramatically, spiking as high as $25-50m daily volume, all happening while PYPL *is* *still in the beta program with very limited access*
* PYPL has announced they intend to open the program to the public in the next couple of weeks
* PYPL has 361 million active users, and SQ has 32 million active users, over 10x the base

&#x200B;

Am I crazy or is PYPL really a no-brainer? Revenue growth could be enormous with net profits easily added to their bottom line._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ I don’t think I’ve ever seen a more define cup and handle. $SPCE to space?

Listen up degenerates as I have an easy 65% gainer(commons) or 2200% for your December calls:  

AOBC (ticker: AOUT) was spun out from SWBI in August.  AOBC was valued at $250M per investor deck and independent valuations (see SEC filings).  This $250M value corresponded to the value of AOBC’s assets in the SWBI consolidated financial statements at 4/30/20.  AOBC is currently valued at market cap of 208M which represents 17% discount to book value.  This is good for a boomer return, but not the lotto ticket we are all looking for.  Here’s the hidden secret.....

In it’s 4/30/20 year end financials SWBI took a $98M impairment charge against the intangible assets of the AOBC business.  The impairment was calculated in March (GW impairment testing was triggered by overall market sell off) and was based on forecasts of sales and cash flows at that time in the unknown COVID world.  Why does that matter?  Amazon is the largest retailer of AOBC products and what was Amazon  only selling in March?  “Essential” products such as toilet paper and tampons.  Other brick and mortar retail outlets were also closed at that time thus severely impacted cash flow forecasts. All of this information is in the FY 20 10-K filing and SEC filings if you want to fact check .  Fast forward to today -  RGR, SPWH, BGFV, VSTO. Etc. are reporting record demand for outdoor products, guns, and accessories. This means it’s extremely likely that sales are at least as strong or likely even better than in February 2020.  Reasonable argument is therefore AOBC is at least worth book value prior to the one-off impairment taken because of COVID.  Based on my analysis, AOBC should have a market cap of at least $350M (pre- impairment value) or even higher which equates to $25+/share.  At current stock price of $15/share this stock should return at least 66%.

To top it off,  the company is not going to disappoint in its first quarterly report.  The execs with juicy unvested stock rewards will not let that happen.

AOBC reports it’s first separate company quarterly results in early December.  Look for this to be the 🚀 event that puts this under the radar small cap stock back on the map.  

TLDR:  buy commons of AOBC and sell at $25 if you are a boomer.  If you want to get rich(er), Buy the December $17.5C for .35  and sell them at $8 after the rip back to FMV.
