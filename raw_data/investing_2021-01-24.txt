And he did. He sent his broker a cable. "COVER ALL RESORTS." At that point the stock had blown by $130 a share and was headed higher.His broker, however, did not get the cable. Wilson discovered this when his broker telephoned him at the Grand Hotel in Taipei and asked, "Resorts is at $190.

Hi all, wondering what your guy's thoughts are on this penny stock \[HIGH RISK\].

Some quick (small) DD:

Pros:

\- Lots of 'assets' (about 200mil)

\- Update on masks coming this week, could drive an increase

\- Medical mask mandate in Europe and States; which is what they produce

\- High PT by the analysts that have looked (not many, $5.00 from one, and $13.00 from others)

\- Has announced no offerings for a month (This is also a con, why should a company need to announce NOT having offerings?? Potentially need cash - but then why are their assets so high?)

\- Offering closing right now.

\- High volume as of late.

Cons:

\- Assets say they have $100mil in 'property' which is extremely suspect, potentially lying as cheap Chinese company could be unregulated.

\- Update on masks could be no approval; although unlikely

\- Not likely that the USA or Europe will purchase masks from China although no guarantees.

\- Analysts' PTs are old; haven't been updated for a while.

\- Has a history of pumps and dumps.

Curious what you guys think of this? In my opinion, regardless of it's movements, this is definitely a short-term play if any._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $Tell DD Long Term Outlook and Value Proposition Edit: Thank you all for the comments. I've incorporated much of the discussion and feedback.

Below is a recap of why I believe whole-heartedly in Tellurian and the potential growth in this company. As full disclosure and being transparent,  I currently hold 117k shares and calls Jan 22 $3, $5, $10, $15 sprinkled in. I began buying Tell at the COVID crash in the .70s. I've wheeled options while rolling money into shares as I've gone. It's been an emotional roller coaster (especially October dips) In one year I started with 60k YOLO and now I'm at 417k at Friday's close. Even with the recent growth in the last 30 days, this is just the beginning for Tell. I'm holding for the long term at least until 2024 when Phase 1 construction is completed.

I could make this post a college essay, but I'll aim to keep it short and to the point.

**Who is Tellurian?**

Tellurian is an LNG (liquid natural gas) provider/exporter that will be a market disruptor with their proposed Driftwood Project, which will make them the first end-to-end (well for sourcing, a pipeline for transportation, terminal LNG for exporting) exporter with an at-cost LNG acquisition independent of domestic HH prices as they'll be selling on JKM.

Driftwood has received federal permits and is 30% engineered. Capital will be funded by equity partners, most likely long-term buyers of future LNG. The equity partner will receive future contracts for at-cost LNG in exchange for the front load of capital. Current partners already include Total and GE. $5B capital is needed for the Final Investment Decision.

Link to Tell's latest presentation: [https://www.tellurianinc.com/news-and-presentations/new-corporate-presentation-2/corporate-presentation\_tellurian\_january-2021\_final/](https://www.tellurianinc.com/news-and-presentations/new-corporate-presentation-2/corporate-presentation_tellurian_january-2021_final/)

The Management team is comprised of heavy hitters and LNG legends including the LNG godfather Charif Souki who was the founder of Cheniere Energy.  If they can do it once, they can do it again.

**LNG**

Over the next decade, there will be a large difference in demand to supply for LNG as countries transition from Coal/Nuclear to "cleaner renewable" sources. Green Energy is forecasted to be 74% of energy generation. For renewables, Solar/Wind is forecasted at 10%-15% of the renewable sources with Bio Mass as 70%-80%. In addition to the domestic shortage of natural gas with the number of offshore rigs shutdown during COVID. Even if they turned them on, it would be 1-2 years before production would be online again.  Tell will be exporting to Asian LNG market (JKM) and European LNG market (TTF) where local markets for natural gas extraction are limited and will rely on imports from providers such as Tell.

LNG will be the source for heat/cooling as it will be used for power generation including all those EVs and Tesla's that need to charge from the grid.

**Price Targets**

At max capacity, Tell valuation would be 100B made by Souki the chairman. Break down the math from there. Tell will retain 40% of capacity for themselves.

2021 - February = $4-$6 (1B valuation / 329M shares)

2021 - March/April = $8-$12 - Deals announced gap up (3B valuation / 329M shares)

2021 - May/June or FID announced = $15-$20 - 5B in capital in (5B valuation / 329M shares)

2023 = $45 at Phase 1 Project completion (15B in valuation / 329M shares). Note: I would expect 1 year delay to 2024 due to hurricanes or natural events.

Mid-decade will see a peak in Demand/Supply pricing where LNG company's valuations could get frothy, much like early to mid-2000s with oil peaks.

Future: 40% capacity equals $80 a share

Future: 100% capacity equals $130 a share

Max would be 100B valuation / 329M shares at $300. Equity partners could comprise 40%-60% of equity that would eat into total available shares._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Spreadsheet to calculate GME Exit Strategy, ROI Calculations & Breakeven Analysis **PLEASE DROP AN UPVOTE AND/OR COMMENT IF YOU USE. IT TOOK ME A FEW HOURS TO MAKE THIS SPREADSHEET AND I WOULD LIKE TO HELP AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE. I SEE A LOT OF PEOPLE OPENING AND DUPLICATING THE SHEET, PLEASE HELP PAY IT FORWARD.**

Disclaimer: I originally created this tool for WSB, but it looks like I am muted there for some reason, so I figured I would share on some other subs where people are also talking about GME.

This whole experience has been (and will be) a crazy trip, but you don't want to be the one caught holding the bag when it eventually comes crashing down to earth. **HAVE AN EXIT STRATEGY.** Everyone has different levels of expendable capital and risk tolerance. Some of us can afford to YOLO away six-figure investments, while others would be more than happy to simply turn a few hundred dollars into a grand.

Your exit strategy should depend on how much money you are comfortable losing, and how much profits you would be happy taking. I'm not here to tell you what your strategy should be, but I did make a tool so you can figure it out for yourself: [Exit Strategy Calculator (Google Sheet)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13twJC8Ldy3p7iS7fp5htOjfhTYZIE_Fqa5Rn9wgqv8c/edit?usp=sharing)

&#x200B;

**HOW TO USE THE EXIT STRATEGY PLANNER**

\- Note 1: **This is for shares only**. I'm not smart enough to make this work for options.

\- Note 2: The link I provided is READ ONLY, so the first step is to **make a copy** for your own use (File --> make a copy)

\- **Now, enter your current position.** Provide the number of shares you have in A3, and your average cost basis in B3 (these cells are highlighted in yellow). Your total investment will automatically calculate in C3.

\- **Columns E-F are the ROI calculator.** Column F tells you what the share price will need to reach in order to hit the ROI listed in Column E. Column G tells you what your total value would be at that share price.

\- **Columns I-K are your break-even analysis**, which basically tells you what the share price would need to be for you to break even by selling X number of your shares, and what your profit would be if you sold all of them at said price. *You will probably want to adjust the #s in Column I based on how many shares you currently have in your position*. Columns J & K will automatically update when you do.

\- **Columns M-N calculate your profits at different share prices.** How much money will you make if you sell when GME hits $80? What about $100, or $250, or even $1,000? These columns will tell you. Feel free to adjust the share prices in column M if you want, but I have most of the big milestones covered.

\- **Columns P-R are your exit strategy planner.** *You will need to provide the following information: # of shares (if any) you want to hold long term, post-squeeze \[cell P4\]. Maximum dollar amount from your initial investment that you can stomach losing \[Q4\]. Profit amount you would be 100% happy cashing out with no FOMO of future gains \[R3\].* Cell Q6 will calculate your "worst case scenario" sell price. **Set a stop loss order at this price to maximize your losses** to the amount you entered in Q4, while still holding your desired # of long-term shares. Cell Q7 will calculate your "best case scenario" sell price. **Set a limit order at this price to cash out with your "100% satisfied profit"** you entered in R4, while still holding your desired # of long-term shares.

\- **Columns T-V is an incremental sales planner.** Some of you may want to sell a portion of your shares when certain benchmarks are hit (ie sell 10 shares when it hits $100, another 10 at $150, etc.). Simply enter in how many shares you want to sell at each price point \[column U\], and the sheet will calculate your cumulative revenues, net profit, and remaining shares.

TLDR: Use this spreadsheet to avoid getting caught holding the bag on GME when all of the shorts are officially squeezed. Make a copy for yourself and change the cells highlighted in yellow to account for your personal position and risk/reward preferences.

Of course you can use this spreadsheet for your other investments, but let's be honest... half of us seem to be all in on GME right now. Big week ahead, may all of our profits be plentiful!

  [https://tos.mx/hb4nEML](https://tos.mx/hb4nEML)_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Perception An Ames room is a distorted room that creates an optical illusion. It was invented by American scientist Adelbert Ames, Jr. in 1946 and was constructed for the first time the following year.

An Ames room is viewed with one eye through a peephole. Through the peephole the room appears to be an ordinary rectangular cuboid: a back wall that is vertical/at right angles to an observer's line of sight; two vertical side walls parallel to each other; and a horizontal floor and ceiling. The true shape of the room, however, is that of an irregular hexahedron. Depending on the design of the room, all surfaces can be regular or irregular quadrilaterals so that one corner of the room is farther from the observer than the other.

I chose to lead with the Ames room because I think it is fitting given the current environment. Recently, renowned value investor Jeremy Grantham wrote that the U.S. stock market was “a ‘real humdinger’ of a bubble that would pop by late spring or summer at the latest.” It is easy to see why he would think that: the rise of Wall St bets pumping stocks like Hertz, Gamestop, etc; Carole Baskin (the Tiger Queen) giving stock endorsements for $300; Elon Musk causing a spike in a stock for recommending an unrelated app (Signal) while each Tesla car ever sold is valued at over $1 million dollars based on the companies market cap; CAPE and P/E ratios at all time highs;  record out of the money call options being purchased… the list goes on. 

#### We definitely are seeing behavior that seems too speculative. So while one can easily sympathize with this viewpoint, we must also ask ourselves:  How does Grantham claim to know these things?  Is he still looking through the peephole or can he see the full dimensions of the actual room? Do we ever see these dimensions?

#### This is the same Jeremy Grantham who wrote a bubble outlook in April 2010 (see white arrow). When you look at the chart below (couldn't add image from post) , it becomes very obvious that he was very wrong. So how do legendary investors get it wrong so often?

 The problem with forecasting any phenomenon (like a bubble) is that we tend to forget that we are always looking through the peephole. And through this peephole our limited viewpoints are confined by our personal environments (the past and present). And it is within these environments that we project what we want to see into an unknown future. We fail to account for the fact that there is no way we can see the whole room because we never actually see the infinite possible scenarios. We cannot rely on our limited perspective (opinions and narratives)  to give us an accurate depiction of the grander scheme.

#### So instead of pontificating, we would much rather use some of the most objective data we have...Price, Volume, and Volatility . We would much rather try to map the moves as they happen. If the bubble is popping, price, volume, and volatility will give us signs. Until then, the trend is to the upside. Of course things can change quickly and all of the bubble talk could be right... but it could also be just like 2010. _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Recommended ETFs for low risk, non-hype Canadian retirement savings (5-7 yr timeline) Cashed out on a Canadian RE investment and intend to put about 50k in a RRSP before the deadline this year. I intend to start withdrawing in 5-7 years so I think want lower risk, dividends over growth.

I try to avoid "beating the market" but I have to overarching opinions that inform my strategy:

- I'm bullish on tech/green energy etc. in the long term, but in the short term (5 yrs) I think there's too big of a correction risk. Theres just so much money being pumped in by retail these days. So I think I want to weight my portfolio against hype stocks like TSLA which are disproportionately weighted in total stock ETFs.

-I also want to avoid interest rate risk, so I lean towards common share equity over preferred shares and bonds.

My initial thought is something along the lines of:

40% - NOBL (ProShares S&P 500 Aristocrats) - good exposure to industrials and consumer staples I believe to be lower risk than large cap tech over the next few years. Consistent with low risk dividend focus.

20% -  XDV (iShares Canadian Dividend) - good exposure to Canadian banks which are reliably high dividend yield. Bit of a hedge against USD vs CAD depreciation (ultimately I will be withdrawing these funds in CAD).

40% - VT (vanguard total world equity) - basic anchor so my portfolio doesn't deviate too much from a large basket of equities. While I think tech is a bit of a bubble right now, I don't want to bet my whole portfolio against it.

There have been many comparisons to Blockbuster and traditional retail that I think underappreciate the difference in product. I still enjoy playing the N64 version of Super Smash Brothers that came out in 1999 when my childhood friends and I get together. Setting aside my nerdiness, the engagement and loyalty of a video game far exceeds that of a movie or apparel. The demographics are increasingly female (reportedly half). So GME is selling a product that can span generations and potentially engage entire families.

Does this mean there needs to be a physical retailer? When Amazon emerged, there was a lot of speculation that physical retail was on its way out and Wal-Mart was becoming obsolete . And while the physical retail landscape has certainly changed, its total demise was hyperbole. Amazon acquired Whole Foods and Wal-Mart is thriving. Smaller retailers have had to shutter but the ones that have survived have emerged stronger. The point here is even if video games move to a digital delivery option, there remains room for a physical retailer of scale in the market. With a ~$4.5bn market cap, GME still has potential to grow with a slice of this industry.

I’m sure people smarter than I have opinions as to what GME needs to do to stay relevant and value-add to game developers, but my view would be to evolve into experiential visits with excellent customer service (incidentally, Chewy’s competitive advantage). Video games have massive budgets with well-known characters. They are brands with potential for licensing of additional products. In addition, e-sports is quickly growing in popularity. The entire physical ecosystem around gaming has immense potential that we are in the early innings of.

Last point, there is an experienced founder aligned with shareholders. I’ve seen great management teams make money in crappy industries and poor management teams lose money in great industries. People can take their own view on his capability, but his money is where his mouth is.

**Valuation**

By any traditional metric, GME is currently overvalued. But part of the reason is because it’s so heavily shorted. The market’s ability to price discover is completely out of whack here. However, the potential for a near term bankruptcy is now gone (incidentally thanks in part to the short sellers) with a more resilient shareholder base than they could’ve expected. Yet shorts continue to stay the course / rise, presumably now holding onto the idea that the valuation will come back down to earth and help recoup their losses. If I pushed to invest in a company only to later discover that a meaningful part of my original thesis was broken, I would be fired much less advocate to invest more.

Shorting a company only because it’s overvalued is not a good thesis in this market. GSX is very likely fraudulent. SFIX is a people based apparel retailer that will have to compete against its suppliers because they need to develop their own D2C platforms. There’s overvaluation everywhere and better short plays.

**Conclusion**

This brings me to my ultimate point and hope. For those that have been long GME – congratulations. It’s impressive to see the support and conviction and it's made me rethink aspects of how I invest. I hope for the company’s sake you are long-term holders. For those thinking about getting in now for the short term, know that you are gambling. You do you, but you could also go to the roulette table and put your money on black which would be faster and more straightforward than trying to time this play.

For those that are short, stop being your own worst enemy. This is not the hill in which I would choose to die on. There's enough notoriety now that new institutions and retail investors may come in to try and break you which undermines the market and the system we’re trying to support. I don’t have a position in GME nor do I intend to start one. I’d just like for some rationality to return to the market.

Good luck to all!

Growth potential:

$MT has grown 150% the last year, forecasts indicate that the growth is likely to continue into the near future as the global economy is recovering from the pandemic and infrastructure production ramps up again. Steel demand is expected to rise and $MT being the largest producer of steel globally is set to be a main player in the game. 

In December $MT announced a binding agreement with the state owned Italian company - Invitalia

Either way.

In my opinion $MT is a stock to keep your eyes on, demand for steel will definitely rise as production ramps up again, and also $MT may play a role in Biden’s-10-year-infrastructure-plan. $MT is in for some good years ahead, it’s a long term play for long term gains._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ MSCI US vs MSCI World performance since 2013 Hi everyone,

Thanks_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Is it too late to get in on BB or GME for a yolo play? As you are probably well aware, two r/wallstreetbets meme stocks have been on fire so far this year. While I feel like I’ve generally missed the boat on these two opportunities, I have some yolo money and I’d like to participate. Is there still short term opportunity with GME or BB? If not BB or GME, are there any other similar short term opportunities out there?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ When is it considered a pump and dump? Serious question. I was reading (a lot) about PLUG Power and have become a little disturbed at the stuff that's apparently allowable. They exchanged shares for purchase orders to where they are basically paying Walmart and Amazon to buy from them, accounting for 70% of their revenues. In this exuberant market that is paying for multiples of revenues on poorly understood technologies, that can obviously skyrocket stock prices. Companies know this. Then they sign an empty MOU with Renault just to generate some buzz. Now that the stock has gone up, insiders (directors and  c-level execs) are selling every share they can get their hands on, they're even vesting their options early.

My question is, when is something actually considered to be a "pump and dump" that warrants SEC intervention? What parameters have to be breached? Does the SEC ever actually enforce, or do they consider it too tricky an area, and generally turn a blind eye?

I know it's not allowed to fake revenues by exchanging purchase orders with another company, for example, so why is it allowable to give away equity for fake revenues? Why does a company that gives away an equity stake to someone credible, get to claim them as an "investor" in the company? What, if any, regulations are there on insiders fire selling their shares when they know their company is grossly overvalued?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Could professionals start using Reddit match the returns of retail traders? I don't understand why professionals find it so hard to beat the market. I've only been investing for about 6 months, but so far I've made 150% returns. I know this isn't much compared to some people here, but it's a lot when you consider professionals struggle to even beat the market.

I know I'm not the best investor. So far I've just been listening to advice on TikTok and Reddit and it's been working out great. I guess professionals are older and don't realise how much information there is on sites like TikTok and Reddit? For example the other day I learnt that Ryan Cohen was added to the board of GME and that this made it a good buy. Now I'm up 60%.

So why do professional investors spend so much time analysing stocks if statistically they don't beat the market? Why don't they just use sites like TikTok and Reddit to see what the most popular stock is this week and invest in that? This seems to be a good strategy which has worked out for a lot of people here.

I guess I'm just surprised at how easy this is given how difficult professionals make it look. Like I said, I've only been doing this for 6 months, but if I continue to make good investments I should be able to become a full time investor in a year or two._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ How is a "massively-coordinated" short-sale operation different, fundamentally, from a pump and dump scheme? I hope this is the right place to post this question.

With the recent exposure that hedge funds have gotten with the GME situation (for what I can only describe as a coordinated short-selling effort by hedge funds against a targeted company), I have the following question: If there's some threshold quantity of short sales that, when met, correlates strongly with a drop in price of said targeted company's stock, such that the profitability of the short sales are guaranteed, then how can such an action not be considered a form of market manipulation nor be actionable against by law enforcement? Both the situation I describe and the well known pump-and-dump scheme both rely on generating the kind of "mass transaction" that leads to a self-fulfilling goal (the pump and dump by way of driving prices up with high volume buys, and coordinated short-selling by driving prices down with high volume shorts / stock sales).

If either my assessment of large-scale short selling OR hedge fun involvement in said endeavor is inaccurate, please help me fill in the gaps. My perception so far of hedge fund involvement in the market in this capacity is that of foul play to the extent that it hurts U.S. business, investors, and those employed by the companies they allegedly prey on. Alternatively if my assessment is accurate, how is this not illegal / not viewed differently from pump-and-dumps?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Trading 212 Stocks and Shares ISA question  If I invest using the app, and put <= £20k in, everything I withdraw from the account and any potential gains wouldn't get taxed right?

I created an algo that scans the most popular trading sub-reddits and logs the tickers mentioned in due-diligence or discussion-styled posts. Instead of scanning for how many times each ticker was mentioned in a comment, I logged how popular the post was among the sub-reddit. Essentially if it makes it to the 'hot' page then it will most likely be on this list. There are two parts to this post. The first is for posts that were submitted in the most active trading sub-reddits (such as this one), and the second part has the most mentioned tickers from the WSB sub-reddit.

**How can I use this list?**

The best way to use this data is to learn about new tickers that might be trending. As an example, I probably would have never known about the ARK etfs, or even Palantir, until they started trending on Reddit. This gives many people an opportunity to learn about these stocks and decide if they want to invest in them or not. The data on this list is limited to one post per ticker. I've taken the most 'popular' post for that ticker on whichever sub-reddit it may have been. What I've found is that normally if tickers begin to trend on one sub-reddit then generally-speaking there will be posts for the same ticker on various other sub-reddits. Here's the data from the last week.

Everyone is so caught up in the market craze that hedging is getting left out, and genuinely I have struggled to find good advice on how to hedge myself. Traditional methods like investing into commodities, bonds, cash etc. are outdated for modern day traders who are over-exposed to the market volatility while trading SPACs, options on ETFs (YOLO, MSOS, DRIV) etc. Hence, I've been trying to figure out a coherent strategy, at least until the summer which is when most of my options expire. OTM calls on inverse leveraged ETFs and Volatility indices is the idea I'm mostly gravitating to. It comes with a myriad of problems though, such as that leveraged ETFs and Indices tend to keep eating at themselves (which is why this aggressive hedging policy won't make much sense past a 6 month period). In any case, in order to make a better informed decision I want to use the historical data from previous market crashes and corrections to see which hedging strategies will work best by using them as case studies. However in order to do that I need access to historical prices. Finding price history of IVX UVXY and SPY is easy, but not finding historical options prices for them. I under it can theoretically be backwards calculated using black-scholes formula but I'm not a programmer (nor I do even know how to calculate it by hand). Any advice on how I could get that data?

Prices will go up for a while since market makers and hedge funds seem to be closing out a lot of their short exposure and everybody wants to ride the coaster up. This has already impacted some companies that have been struggling.

Likewise I’m hearing that mm are reducing their exposure to gamma squeeze risk. So in theory, we’re getting closer and closer to the point where the insane sort of post March gains shouldn’t be as feasible.

If we get a stimulus soon, a bunch of dumb money will enter the markets in shares and otm call plays. But, if the MM are reducing naked contract exposure, they’ll just be selling to close these positions as the market goes up.

You can only have so much retail pump before liquidity becomes an issue I feel. All the retail wants to hold till the moon, but after the next round of stimulus, the really dumb money won’t be able to keep buying right? And Institutional holders will need to start cycling out of their risk since the upside will start stagnating.

And we’re already seeing educated bets on the upside with limited downside exposure through itm leaps. There’s smart people out there who want to ride the coaster without betting the barn.

So what happens next? Let’s say GME moons to 100/share once they squeeze Melvin et all. Who’s going to buy GME at $100 a share once the retail runs out of cash? Who’s going to pick up additional Peloton or TSLA at these valuations - again, once retail runs out of cash?

It seems like we’re just getting started and I’m definitely going to make what I can on the ride up, but it really feels like in a year or two we’ll be facing some liquidity issues, esp for the players who don’t take any profits on the ride up.

Obviously I’m not predicting a black swan and I really don’t see a catalyst to pop the bubble per say. But I do wonder how close we are to a liquidity crunch and what players can do to limit exposure as they take profits.

Where are we in the market cycle? ) - 1/23/2021 Hello investors,

(for pictures, please refer to the original post)

[https://www.reddit.com/r/Midasinvestors/comments/l3ugu7/market\_commentary\_how\_about\_that\_gme\_and\_bb\_craze/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Midasinvestors/comments/l3ugu7/market_commentary_how_about_that_gme_and_bb_craze/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

Wow... Like everyone else, I'm mesmerized by the stratospheric price action in the past few days. Look at the below numbers.

&#x200B;

GME (GameStop) made so many people happy and wealthy. Congratulations to everyone who participated in this amazing movement!!

GME has been the topic of conversation for literally every single robinhooders and traders. 

I'm sure by now that most of you are familiar with what happened to GME but for those who don't know, the short story is that the market markers and the short-sellers were "squeezed", aka forced, to close/hedge their positions.

These positions would have helped drive the stock price down in the past but since they closed them now, those downward pressures have evaporated. This basically lifted the ceiling and then the price skyrocketed.

I know this phenomenon has created bipolar views on the stock markets right now. 

One group of people are advocating for the continued run-up in GME, BB, and PLTR (the folks on the next door) by squeezing the market makers and short-sellers, while the other group of people are talking down on those "yoloers" who are acting crazy and irrational.

The reason why I'm mentioning GME? For two reasons:

1) I see an asymmetric opportunity in these crazy stocks. 

2) It serves as an important indicator for the overall market conditions.

**1) In my view, there is a good risk/reward situation in GME, BB, and so on.**

To preface my argument, I like to consider myself very conservative, risk-averse, and value-oriented investor. I emphasize on fundamentals, the stock price playing true to the company's earnings, and the actual cash flows.

I'm very like-minded with those group of people who think this GME run-up is crazy and irrational.

However, many people forget that being a "rational" investor doesn't mean you should just ignore those hot tech stocks, crypto-mania, or GME price action.

As a "rational" investor, you also don't need to feel jealous and anxious about those people who became wealthy from GME. I would like to go even a step further to compliment them for getting in at the right time.

Afterall, we are playing a game of probability. 

If your friends or neighbors win lotteries in millions of dollars, should you feel jealous? Should you feel the FOMO? Absolutely not. No one could've seen this coming and some people do get lucky. You can't blame a guy for winning a jackpot.

Now, let's talk about what actions we can take to benefit from this situation.

The way I look at it, we now have confirmed that lots of short-sellers in GME and BB have already realized their losses, aka covered their shorts. 

The market makers also have realized losses from their gamma squeeze, which is a more complicated concept but to simplify, it means that the downward pressure on the stock has weakened.

It's rather a simple idea. We are looking at a situation where the stock can move further up due to the lifting of these ceilings. 

If I had to put numbers, it would certainly be more than 1:1 payout ratio but more like 3:1 ratio.

Why wouldn't anyone participate in a game of blackjack that gives you 3x or 4x your money?

To be extremely clear, I mention blackjack because buying these stocks is pure gambling, nothing more. It is not "investing".

Yet, it's gambling where the odds are tilted in our favor and thus, risk/reward is relatively high.

Therefore, I have bought BB calls for 2% of my portfolio, specifically BB because the short interest is lower than GME.

Furthermore, I'm going to try to be cute and buy more GME call options come Monday. 

I would think that GME price would tank on Monday due to the excessive price run-up last Friday so that creates a buying opportunity.

If I lose that 2% BB? I'm totally okay with that. If it goes up 5x? Lucky me.

ONLY BET AN AMOUNT OF MONEY YOU ARE OKAY LOSING!

&#x200B;

**2) What do all of these tell us about our current position in the market?**

Typically, these types of manias are observed during market-tops. 

Howard Marks and David Einhorn list out the typical signs of market-tops.

1. Initial public offering mania
2. High valuations and new metrics for valuation
3. Market concentration in a single sector and a few stocks
4. S&P 500-type market capitalizations for second-tier stocks that most people haven’t heard of
5. A situation where the more fanciful and distant the narrative, the better the stock performs
6. Outperformance of companies suspected of fraud based on the belief that there is no enforcement risk, without which “crime pays”
7. Outsized reaction to economically irrelevant stock splits
8. Increased participation of retail investors, who appear focused on the best-performing names
9. Incredible trading volumes in speculative instruments, like weekly call options and worthless common stocks
10. **A parabolic ascent toward a top.**

(for those who don't know Howard Marks, I highly encourage to follow his "memos" on his website [https://www.oaktreecapital.com/insights/howard-marks-memos](https://www.oaktreecapital.com/insights/howard-marks-memos). He is a legendary bond investor.)

Of the above ten signs, roughly all of them describe the situation today very well.

We are seeing IPO mania, high valuations, market concentration in a few stocks, outsized reaction to economically irrelevant stock splits, increased participation of retail investors, incredible trading volumes in speculative instruments, and parabolic ascent toward a top.

It's no doubt we are "near" the market top. But how near? 3 months, 1 year, 5 years..?

How can all of these happen in less than a year after the steepest GDP decline in history?

The answer is monetary and fiscal responses. 

I mentioned in this commentary ([https://www.reddit.com/r/Midasinvestors/comments/knxgex/market\_commentary\_2021\_outlook\_12312020/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Midasinvestors/comments/knxgex/market_commentary_2021_outlook_12312020/) towards the bottom) that right now, the two biggest driving factors in the markets are the gov't and the JPow & Co. 

The government is spending like there is no tomorrow, which makes total sense because it is much more dangerous for our economy to under-spend than over-spend.

Jerome Powell is also providing massive purchases of Treasuries and zero rates policy, for the foreseeable future.

As long as these two massive forces are in action, we will see even a greater hype and craze in the markets.

We just started a bull-market run. Look at the below graphs.

Given the fact that we just started a bull market and also observed lots of bubbles happening everywhere, I believe that we will see one of the greatest bubbles in history (if not already) until every last one of those the market bears are proven wrong. 

W**hen every single person at the cocktail party is expecting a market rally, it is at that moment that the market is truly at the top and the bubble bursts.**  

That doesn't mean that market corrections of 10% or more can't happen in the meantime. In fact, I have been saying that there will be market corrections in the very near future and we should be ready for that as well.

To summarize today's post, I would say there are opportunities in these maniac stocks and we should take advantage of them with limited risks. The manias also indicate that we are near the top of another market cycle and we should closely monitor the actions of the government and JPow & Co.

&#x200B;

**Quick report card for 2020**

Below post was my first market commentary one on Reddit, where I said I was bullish on tech names (BABA, PDD, STNE, FUTU, AMZN, FVRR, W, and SEDG).

[https://www.reddit.com/r/Midasinvestors/comments/jtaze1/market\_commentary\_11122020/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Midasinvestors/comments/jtaze1/market_commentary_11122020/) 

I've gotten winners and losers, the losers being BABA and W. The winners were the rest. 

Obviously, I would've never thought that FUTU would double in less than a month. I held call options on them but it was pure luck. 

I also called for rise in long-term treasury yield. Although I got the direction correct, the yield curve took way longer than I expected to steepen significantly. Now, I am even more bearish on the 30-year than before due to the rates breaking the technical levels.

I was also long gold. I have unrealized losses on this one but I plan on getting back in as this is a 2-3 year play.

As always, please feel free to share your ideas!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ What's with the hyper-enthusiasm around cryptocurrency? So I have a friend who recently got into bitcoin. At the start she was watching videos on Youtube from guys like the Rich Dad Poor Dad fellow, and whenever I'd ask questions about why she trusted these people the answer was something along the lines of "I just do."

Now, the way she talks about it, and the tone she takes when I question how good it is as an investment vehicle is genuinely a bit concerning to me. It feels almost like a conversation with a cultist or one of those MLM pushers, where they seem so certain they're going to make money and push back on or dismiss basically any suggestion that it's risky at all, which as far as I'm aware, it is.

It seems to me that so many crypto-enthusiasts behave like this too, and while I am a bit on the fence about whether or not I want to buy some crypto, this cultist behavior is unsettling to me and pushes me further into the camp of not buying.

I've never seen this kind of attitude from anyone other than cultists and MLM pushers yet it seems so prevalent in crypto and because of that I feel really uncomfortable buying into it even though I don't see that many other downsides. Can someone with more knowledge on this market explain this to me a little? The amount of hype a lot of these crypto guys seem to have just screams "too good to be true" to me._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ T long. Risk vs reward. Am I crazy? New here but have been investing for a bit of time ~8 or so years (I’m a youngin). When I look at T (AT&T) I see a lot more reward potential then risk. Sure their debt is through the rough (probably an understatement) and yeah their management could be better (see previous post) but I think the risk on T right now is a lot lower than the reward. 

1) if they sell Half of direct tv they are able to reduce some of their debt (reported 15-20bn) and to go with this they have enough cash flow to continuously reduce debt in coming years
1a) I understand the investment in 5G but I see this as a wise and necessary investment.
2) time Warner: while they teaming of the acquisition could not be worse with covid, I think in the long run this has benefited them. They’ve reportedly met their 2021 goal for subscribers already and once theaters (hopefully not an if) come back I can only see that helping (same day release both platforms)
3) I don’t see cell phone carriers going anywhere anytime soon (yes they might not be major growth stocks, understandably so)
4) T’s dividend looks to be reasonably safe over the next couple years at a minimum. ~7% seems like a safe bet in this market

Let me know what y’all think!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ EpiPen Class Action Can Proceed;Mylan Loses Bid to Dismiss Lawsuit A U.S. district judge has ruled that a class action lawsuit against Mylan Inc., the marketer of the EpiPen auto-injector, and a group of pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) can proceed.
Mylan, now part of Viatris Inc., and the PBMs lost in a bid to have the Minnesota-based class action dismissed. The suit, brought by drug distributors, alleges that the Mylan and the PBMs conspired to engage in anticompetitive practices that drove up the price of EpiPens for mutual benefit.
Mylan has faced pricing controversy since it surfaced that the list price for a set of two branded EpiPens rose rapidly to $600 in 2016, an increase of more than 500 percent from 2008
PBMs usually negotiate favorable prices for their insurer clients, but the lawsuit alleges that instead the defendant PBMs accepted large rebates – described as kickbacks – from Mylan. In return, the suit contends the PBMs gave highly preferential treatment to EpiPen versus new auto-injector competitors (Auvi-Q and the generic version of Adrenaclick), which were either kept off insurer formulary lists or put in less favorable formulary tiers.

The PBMs and Mylan each argued separately that they did nothing outside of normal commercial business, and that the plaintiffs failed to make the case that they had violated the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) or, in Mylan’s case, also the Sherman Act. (The latter relates to unlawful behavior to maintain a monopoly.)
However, U.S. District Judge Eric Tostrud in Minnesota ruled that the “plaintiffs have stated plausible claims under RICO and the Sherman Act.” While Mylan and the PBMs contended they were pursuing their own “divergent goals” as businesses, Tostrud found that “the Complaint contains a fairly clear description of why Mylan and the PBM Defendants all had interests in keeping EpiPen prices inflated.”
Mylan argued as well that the plaintiffs’ claims exceeded a four-year statute of limitations, but Tostrud said dismissal on that basis would be “inappropriate” at this stage of legal proceedings

What am I missing?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Is Gold priced too high? Hello all curious your thoughts on this ... Is gold priced too high at the moment? It seems to be already priced for a bear market. If the market drops will it go up much more? It went up in March 2020 and has not gone down much yet. What is going on here?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Observation: US corporate credit performance near identical to 2007-09 and if analogy holds, we are in 2009. [Not my base case] [https://imgur.com/a/QfV1dXN](https://imgur.com/a/QfV1dXN)

The below text is graphed in the link above.

In somewhat of a surprising analogy, the year over year performance (spread) for total returns for US HY - IG credit in the last down cycle (i.e. high yield underperforms IG) looks quite similar to 2007-2009. On Wednesday, performance turned positive, which had not occurred since December 2019.

Separately, as posted on in April 2020, I have subscribed to higher treasury yields, specifically the 10 year. I still hold this belief given current economic data, as described in a December 2020 post. In my estimate, the 10Y has between 75-100bps of upside risk. This is a moving target, as a collapse in personal savings and/or a significant rise in the monetary base could bring my fair value estimate closer to the most recent yield.

Basically the oil price has been fine for most of the last year (except a bad patch of a month or two) and yet the share prices of **some** oil companies doesn't reflect that.

Plot up a graph on yahoo finance of the oil supermajors, compare.

https://tinyurl.com/y2tsura6

Plot their share prices relative to the oil price, compare. 

https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/bp-stock

https://markets.businessinsider.com/commodities/oil-price?op=1

Some are only 10-15% below last year or two's average price which is probably about fair given the bad patch. (CVX, TOT)

But others are down a solid 30-40%. I personally feel those represent a good chance to make money. XOM, BP, RDS. 

BP in particular has been targetting profitability at $35/barrel. How much of the year was spent above that level? Err, almost all of it? This is also the first year BP has been free of making significant payments for the gulf of mexico spill. When can you reduce your costs the most? During a downturn when people are desperate to keep their jobs/trade. 

Anyway, the chance to invest has been there for months. **So why care now?**

**Because earnings come out over the next 10 days for the supermajors (28th Jan -> 4th Feb).**

I don't think they're going to be incredible earnings (I would assume May's quarterlies will be quite solid though), but I suspect that the earnings reports  will spike the prices on the 'cheap' supermajors to bring them into line with the 'getting close to normal valuation' ones. There's probably a long-short trade involving CVX and RDS (both heavily into LNG) for example. Or a long-short involving short CVX+TOT and long XOM-BP-RDS. 

All this talk of restricting supply (pipeline, drilling permits)? Great for oil prices.

All this talk of carbon taxes? Great for oil/gas. Go to the IEA's website and look up how much of world power actually comes from coal, oil, gas and renewables. Coal is the worst (roughly 2 units of CO2 for each 1.5 for oil or 1 for gas, per unit of energy). But it's a huge source of energy for the world particularly in india, china, developing countries. Offhand, I think coal supplied more than 1/3 of the world's electricity in 2017-2018.

https://www.iea.org/reports/world-energy-outlook-2020

There is absolutely no possibility that renewables can replace coal in the next 5 years, but oil and gas can -and will- trivially scale to do it, yielding absolutely colossal reductions in particulate and CO2 emissions. And the money earned from that is being funnelled into renewables projects that will be profitable in years to come.

I'm talking my book though: I hold BP, RDS. Anyway - **this is not financial advice**, you need to do your own research, particularly look at those graphs, the IEA website, etc, have a bit of a think, figure out what other types of information you could look up and consult, don't just believe what some random post on reddit tells you. This could all be a lie, or you could be presented with a totally one-sided argument here. Doubt is healthy._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Why would you sell covered calls on a highly volatile stock that you want to hold long term? Aren't you betting against your own intuition and risking your position for pennies on the dollar? Hello, I recently funded an account with a new brokerage to start messing around with options. I have 250k MSFT in my main portfolio at a brokerage I'm not approved to trade options with yet. I've decided to use PLTR to test the waters with skimming premiums before I employ the strategy on my main.

From what I can tell, selling a covered call is a bearish play against the underlying. I bought 200 shares of PLTR, with which to sell covered calls. I sold 2 calls at .59 at a strike price of 40 expiring 2/19. My plan is to skim premiums from highly OTM options. Isn't this quite... stupid, for lack of a better word? The company has the three most important dates since it DPO'd all coming before expiration, implying possibility of high volatility. It jumped 25% yesterday. I realize I didn't pick an optimal call to sell. Risking 200 shares of a company I believe in for $.59*200 seems silly to me. If I sell at 45 I'll be hit with hundreds in taxes to jump back in. I'm also down a lot currently because the stock did just what I thought it would (went up).

Is there something I'm missing? Should you only ever be selling covered calls on relatively static companies like MSFT? Or did I simply create a shitty contract?

Finally, my gut reaction because I'm so bullish is to buy 100 shares at open on Monday. Is this a good idea for hedging against a stock you're bullish on that's rocketing toward your strike price? I can't sell cash-secured puts as all of my shares are locked up in the aforementioned covered calls.

Thanks_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ All right WTF is going on with GME I hang with you guys, not the YOLO's at r/WSB, but I'm reading tonight and they're all convinced that the crazy run on GME is just starting (they're also high on BB).

Maybe I'm just feeling a little FOMO, but I have some FU money and thinking about throwing some money at GME and BB next week just for the rush. Anyone else thinking about it?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Proterra - Clean Energy & the Biden Administration (from the guy that brought you LAZR) Good Evening r/investing,

I know it was announced here a few weeks ago that Proterra (ACTC/ACTCW) was going public via SPAC (Special Purpose Aquisition Company). I don't posts here too often, but I wanted to to kick the tires quick on why Proterra is my favorite EV/Industrial play for the Biden Administration. 

Many of you may already know who Proterra is, but for the new folks, Proterra is an Electric Bus/Vehicle manufacturer located in the United States. They are headquartered in Burlingame, CA and manufacture all their vehicles at their factory in Los Angles, CA. Proterra manufactures buses for public, private, and commercial use. Unlike some of the other recent EV spacs, Proterra actually has vehicles on the road and generated 193 million in revenue in 2020. You can find out more about Proterra's products here: [https://www.proterra.com/applications/](https://www.proterra.com/applications/)

So, now that we know what Proterra is, why is it important during Biden's Administration? Well, Biden is set to announce his major Infrastructure plan in February.  Biden says we will “make historic investments in infrastructure, along with  manufacturing, research and development and clean energy.”  Infrastructure, clean energy, good paying industrial jobs, Proterra checks all those boxes.

Treasury Secretary Yellen also agrees with Biden.  Yellen called climate change "one of the most critical issues facing our  country." She emphasized that one of Biden's upcoming infrastructure  plans will invest in clean technology, renewable energy and promote the  use of electric vehicles.  Yellen also said, "It will be my core focus, if I'm confirmed as treasury secretary, to focus on the needs of America's workers." (She was confirmed)(She also floated the idea of a "carbon tax")

The final piece to this puzzle, and what makes me especially bullish, is a lady named Jennifer Granholm. Who on earth is Jennifer Granholm? Well she's a former Governor of Michigan, but she's CURRENTLY Biden's nominee for Secretary of Energy. Do you know what else she does? She currently serves on the Board of Directors at.... wait for it..... Proterra. I think this one speaks for itself.

TLDR: US EV Manufacturer with 193mil rev + Biden Admin Infrastructure/Clean Energy Legislature + Jennifer Granholm = Gains

If you are like me, the answer is yes.  But how does a non-billionaire go about investing in a baseball team? It’s not like they trade on the stock exchange - well one team does.  Not only does it trade on the stock exchange but 1) it is a fantastic baseball organization - both in terms of current on-field success and competitively advantaged through long term thinking & cost discipline (2) it operates in one of the best markets with very strong population growth and a super-regional fanbase (3) it sells at a meaningful discount to my estimate of private market value ($35-40 per share value vs. $25 current price) and includes some very valuable real estate (4) value of sports teams/media rights continues to grow -further the team being discussed is currently under-earning on its local media rights -cash flow will increase upon renegotiation (5) it is controlled by one of the greatest value creators of all time - John Malone.

 % Saving Per Year For Retirement: 15.18% _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ How do you identify companies that are running on a loss but this is a 'good loss' like -- Uber, Amazon? Is such a company probably very rare as a penny stock, etc? For example -- you skim through a financial report. They're running at a loss, blah blah blah. But how can you identify what is a good loss; one that can blossom into something much better? For example, they're reinvesting into R&D, or what not, that sort of thing. Etc, so on.

So I'm really terrible at dealing with temptation and controlling my emotions/instincts when it comes to investing. Pulling out when things are going down etc.

I'm looking for a way to have an account that I can only access in 40 years, and all that I can do before then is deposit funds in it and buy stock. Mostly I'm looking at broad ETF's Vanguards/iShares entire market cap type thing. I'm 20 years old and looking to sort out my pension by hard-saving in these next few years. 

I had thought of just hiding a password in a friends place, but I'm not too keen on that because I don't want them to have any power over my savings. Mostly, I'm looking for a futureproof platform that locks in my funds until a select date. Does that exist?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ How long does the peak of a short squeeze last? Everyone on every investing subreddit has been talking about the GameStop short squeeze, and a subset of those have probably been wondering if it's still too late to get in on the gains. I've looked up events like this that have happened in the past, like with Volkswagen. It was at its highest value for a day in 2008, but I'm curious at what point or price does it eventually bottom out? 

In cases like GME and VW, do investors only have one day to cash out at the top before a rapid sell-off, and everyone else just gets the scraps?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_
