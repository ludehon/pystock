 Why $EDIT is going to be a unique monster st(co)ck 👀 🚀🚀 Rockets made u click uh retard? Welcome on board brother.

Let's start with an introduction: **Editas Medicine** is a clinical-stage [biotechnology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biotechnology) company which is developing therapies based on [CRISPR–Cas9 gene editing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRISPR_gene_editing) technology. It can count on a strong 5 star team, such as Dr. Feng Zhang (Pioneer in CRISPR) , Dr. George Church from Harvard (this guy is actually so positively retarded that he's going to bring back **Mammoths** to life through gene editing [https://reviverestore.org/projects/woolly-mammoth/progress/](https://reviverestore.org/projects/woolly-mammoth/progress/) ) and it was also co-founded by Jennifer Doudna (Noble Prize for CRISPR).

Why am I betting onto this one? Amongst the other CRISPR related stocks, Editas shines as the only company with a 'best in class' Investigational New Drug called EDIT-101. [https://ir.editasmedicine.com/news-releases/news-release-details/editas-medicine-announces-fda-acceptance-ind-application-edit](https://ir.editasmedicine.com/news-releases/news-release-details/editas-medicine-announces-fda-acceptance-ind-application-edit)

EDIT-101 is currently in early stage clinical phase, on the path to be FDA approved, and it is being developed to cure LCA (Leber Congenital Amaurosis). **WHAT THE FUCK IS LCA**? For noobs and retards like myself, in synthesis it's BLINDNESS. Here's an explanation for the brave:

* LCA is the most common cause of inherited childhood **blindness** with 3/100,000 children around the world affected
* Symptoms of LCA appear within the first years of life, resulting in significant **vision loss** and potential blindness
* Symptoms include:
   * Significant vision loss
   * Rapid involuntary eye movement
   * No measurable electroretinogram activity due to loss of **photoreceptor** cells (the cells in the eye that take in light and help us see)
* The most common form of the disease, LCA10, accounts for approximately 20-30 percent of all LCA patients
* LCA10 is caused by mutations in the *CEP290* gene
* **There are currently no treatment options available for LCA10**

Yes, there are currently no options to cure this. That's why I'm so bullish on this stock and its future, if in the next few years it gets FDA approval, you'll see this stock skyrocket to Jupiter on a SpaceX rocket made by Papa Elon. **CHECK THIS ARTICLE OUT**  [**https://ir.editasmedicine.com/news-releases/news-release-details/editas-medicine-demonstrates-dose-dependent-vivo-editing-edit**](https://ir.editasmedicine.com/news-releases/news-release-details/editas-medicine-demonstrates-dose-dependent-vivo-editing-edit) . Their treatment has been proven successful on human cells, mice and non-human primates, I'm confident the path to curing this disease is in good hands and I have faith Editas is going to be the first company to achieve such accomplishment.

CRSPR and NTLA are focusing and more advanced in clinical trials on curing Sickle Cell Disease or Beta-Thalassemia, I need to look and do more research into this. Cathie Wood is betting on the disruptive technologies into the genomic space and she thinks that most of these stocks are going to outperform Tesla in the next 5/10 years.

Editas is currently in both **ARKK** and **ARKG ETFs**, so you know Mama Cathie Woodiezz got your ass covered for now. Do your own DD. Risky play if it doesn't get FDA approval.

Fuck you and happy new year._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Your first play for the new year should be VALE (DD) -- Tesla with a hint of steel ALRRRRRRRRRRIGHTY THEN...

Here is the link to the novel of a post that was made 3 months ago about why a Vale-Tesla partnership is imminent. [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/iuk3h0/wanna\_play\_tsla\_but\_no\_money\_vale/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/iuk3h0/wanna_play_tsla_but_no_money_vale/) \-- **Everything written in this DD is inspired by the previous post, but with recent news, the inevitable is on the horizon.**

A few days ago, LG Chem was reported to have invested $9.8 Billion into battery development in Indonesia. 70% of the nickel processing will also have to occur within Indonesia (per the local government), so the mining company must be an industry titan [https://insideevs.com/news/463711/lg-chem-indonesia-mou/](https://insideevs.com/news/463711/lg-chem-indonesia-mou/)

Why is this important? Well, Indonesia's President wants to take advantage of large Nickel deposits by striking a deal with Tesla since EV battery technology requires the metal. [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-indonesia-president-tesla-exclusive-idCAKBN27T13Q](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-indonesia-president-tesla-exclusive-idCAKBN27T13Q)

LG Chem is one of Tesla's key battery makers. [https://electrek.co/2020/12/17/tesla-lg-chem-closer-reports-new-nickel-battery-supply-deal/](https://electrek.co/2020/12/17/tesla-lg-chem-closer-reports-new-nickel-battery-supply-deal/)

Just a few weeks ago, Tesla sent a team to Indonesia to speak with government officials about a nickel deal. [https://seekingalpha.com/news/3643891-tesla-to-trek-to-indonesia-in-nickel-hunt](https://seekingalpha.com/news/3643891-tesla-to-trek-to-indonesia-in-nickel-hunt)

So why Vale then? The key here is the environmental impact. As you might know, Elon started Tesla as a crusade through which he aims to make the world a better place. He has made all his patents public for the single purpose that the development of EVs is sped up for the greater good of the human race. As much as everyone likes to think that billionaires are spineless assholes, Elon truly does care about the environment and the future of our planet -- no wonder he also wants to start a mars colony, because he recognizes the issues our world faces.

Elon tweeted a while back about how he wants to mine nickel responsibly [https://twitter.com/business/status/1297164794617831425?lang=en](https://twitter.com/business/status/1297164794617831425?lang=en).

Out of the 3 companies with major mining operations in Indonesia, Vale is the most suitable to mine nickel in an environmentally friendly manner. And just this past month Vale confirmed the expected sale of their mine in New Caledonia, which was built using the same environmentally-risky infrastructure that previously caused issues with iron mining in Brazil [https://seekingalpha.com/article/4396802-nickel-monthly-news-for-month-of-december-2020](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4396802-nickel-monthly-news-for-month-of-december-2020). This is most definitely an attempt to clean things up to attract Elon's investment. Not to mention that Tesla was already being supplied nickel from this New Caledonia mine, so it's as if Elon enjoyed the trial version and now wants to swing big.

Let's recap. The ball is rolling for Tesla to partake in Nickel operations within Indonesia. As Indonesia's most environmentally responsible and most capable miner, Vale is a lock for the partnership with Tesla.

**Positions:** 

**VALE 03/2021 18c** 

And oh ya, as an iron mining giant, Vale is also set to profit handsomely from this whole steel shortage mess that papi vito has been so avidly writing about. Steel could push the price up while Tesla will send it to the moon.

Happy new year idiots. Here's to a fruitful 2021 that we're kicking off with this play!! ​​​🚀🚀​​🚀​_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ GME DD from a retard bull - The credit market, why GME gang has two daddies, omnichannel and more I've been noticing some GME bears coming out of the woods so here's a DD up your butthole, don't worry, I'll use lube and I'll ease into it slowly.

"GME GONNA BE BANKRUPT HUUR DURR" - GME bears

If GME was going bankrupt, it would've done so already during the lockdown, not in the beginning of a console cycle. Here's a brief look at the credit markets backdrop and I'll explain why GME won't go bankrupt anytime soon and is in fact very bullish for GME.

I'm not gonna go into how GME improved their balance sheets and got FCF, lots of people did that already, but I'll say something in WSB terms. Printers go BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR yo. When the IG and HYG credit market went to shit back in March and April, JPOW pulled out his magnificent printers and set it to BRR mode, the end result is well functioning credit markets with spreads that are tight af. With yields in treasuries and IG being low, people are forced to look for yield in junk bonds. This is why you hear about how CCL was able to raise debt without using ships as collateral and airlines using their flyer points as collateral to raise debt. Creditors are willing to lend at laughable rates  just to get yield. Now GME doesn't need to raise more debt, it is meeting it obligations early but if it ever needs to raise capital for future growth operations, they can easily raise capital in the credit market for as long as JPOW sets the printer in BRR mode. Which we know won't change until at least 2023, I honestly think it'll be longer than that  but it doesn't matter anyways since wsb doesn't even look 6 months out ahead. Notice how we haven't had as much bankruptcies as people thought we would ?(small businesses don't count) Well that's because of our great lord and savior, JPOW

So there you have it, betting on GME bankruptcy is essentially betting against JPOW losing control of the credit market. **JPOW is in effect GME gang's daddy #1**. (iloveyoujpow)

"BUT GME HAD NEGATIVE EPS FOR SO MANY YEARS!" - more gay GME bears

You see the problem with bears is that they are always backwards looking, no vision for the future, no hopes for anything, always depressing. For some reason they can't understand that a lot of the market participants are writing off 2020 because of the pandemic, they also can't understand GME is cyclical and moves along with the console cycle, meaning we are now in the early days of a gme pump. Their inability to look forward is in fact the number 1 reason why their wives have chad forward looking boyfriends. **Our forward looking chad is of course Ryan Cohen (Daddy #2)**, I don't even need to explain more, but GME GANG daddy #2 obviously has a vision and he is more than ready to double down on his bet, buying GME at $16 just two weeks ago. He had a few mysterious tweets recently and people are speculating that he is ready to make another move. I'm not going to join the speculation  but the fact that he bought at $16 means that is probably the floor price and I would go all in with calls if it ever dips below that.

"THEY HAVE NO VIABLE BUSINESS MODEL IN THE AGE OF ECOMMERCE" - Gay bear and Melvin capital

We have to give credit where it's due, Melvin capital likely had significant alpha with their investment thesis. If you look at their holdings, you'll see that they are long ecommerce and short specialty retail. They saw the demise of various brick and mortar stores back around 2015 and executed on that thesis. I'd argue that the covid pandemic essentially pulled forward all the earnings growth and priced in a lot of that growth with high PE multiples. The problem with that thesis is that it is now old, ecommerce is a crowded trade and this will not be an alpha generating thesis.  The best way to generate alpha is now to invest in a new counter thesis that can outperform the crowded ecommerce thesis.

Omnichannel is one of such counter thesis, it's starting to get hyped everywhere. This is why Sherman repeats that word like he's autistic, this guy probably mutters it while banging his wife but judging by his conference call, she's probably never been excited by him. Likely he doesn't know how to execute on that thesis, thank god for GME GANG DADDY RC.

That's not to say he is useless, despite all the shit we gave him. Sherman managed to close down unprofitable stores, reduced inventory and got cashflow positive during a pandemic. This is textbook shit but still very important. and despite the letters RC put out, he could be very receptive of his ideas for all we know. He has shown to be somewhat shareholder friendly through previous buybacks and he did not rule out further share buybacks. Sherman himself holds over 1million shares and has not yet sold them as far as I know. The shelf offering concerns seems to have faded for now, and it will become smaller as the stock price increases. I really just think GME management wants to use that to capitalize on any potential pumps in the stock. This will probably be re-invested anyways.

So what did GME do so far to improve its business model? So far I've seen the following

1. Pivot to ecommerce and improving ecommerce sales - which has seen decent growth
2. Diversifying sales to include more high margin items like PC accessories, PC monitors, etc ( If I speculate, there may be partnerships with certain brands
3. Focusing on loyalty programs like power ups - I'll never understand loyalty programs but some people are retardedly loyal to stores that offer rewards. If they can offer good incentives they can achieve high conversion rates , as far as I know, GameStop is the only specialty video game retailer in north America that offers such reward programs.
4. Store rebranding - this might be good for their goodwill, which got hammered over the years

Daddy RC has more plans for GME and we can only speculate what they might be right now, but with 12% stake, he has what he needs to go full on activist on the BoD. I expect to see some departures and replacements in the reasonably near future.

If that's not enough for you, here's a few more possible catalysts for the stock that I don't see a lot of people mentioning

1. A possible new Nintendo console release in \~1-2 years
2. Currently distressed commercial REITs = ability to negotiate lower rent = more $$$
3. Likely return of inflation (debatable but money supply ballooned and we are seeing velocity pick up a bit) with JPOW promising to keep rates at 0% even when inflation comes back = bullish for all stocks, bears will get slaughtered
4. OG printer Yellen manning the treasury in a month + possible dem senate = more stimmy checks = more money going into GME
5. If sales improve and balance sheets continue improve, we might see more credit upgrades
6. Better sales = possible dividend re-instatement , I couldn't care less about dividends but guess who's going to be paying? The shorts lol.  If Sherman had balls, he would pull an OSTK and announce a special dividend , which will actually lead to a short squeeze while wsb laughs collectively as  we get meme returns from this boomer move.

I'm sure the OG GME bulls can think of more reasons, I've been in and out of GME since it was at $9 (my CC's kept on getting assigned).

Current positions

500x GME shares - ready to buy more at the dip Monday and Tuesday, going to sell a few puts

15x Apr $20c 

10x  Jan 15 $20c YOLOs

So does this mean I think GME will squeeze to $69 by next friday? No. GME short interest has been high for years, Melvin capital isn't going to be that worried since their GME position is likely hedged and not a big part of their holdings (they're probably laughing at wsb for all the memes we put out). We will likely have a few more dips next week which I will buy. Depending on how much WSB pumps GME before ICR or console sale release (which I expect to be lackluster due to shortages), I'll either take profit or sell some ITM calls if IV's are high. Then buy the dip.

TLDR:GME bankruptcy is out of the question for the next 3-5 years because of the macro and credit market, RC is putting a floor of $16 on the price (debatable but you're welcome to buy puts or short below $16). bears need to stop looking backwards and be anticipatory. GME short squeeze likely not going to happen overnight but a bit slowly as more people realize GME isn't going bankrupt and either buy in or cover their short positions._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ It literally can't go tits up _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Lady Cathie Bullish on Gaming? (6:43) $GME 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Is there any parallel for a stock to be as shorted as GME currently is in recent history? Sup fellow retards lurking on WSB on a closed market day

I'm trying to look more into short squeezes and kind of put all the (justified) hype into historical context. What are some other well known short squeezes that could be used as comparisons? Others that have been mentioned to me: JMIA/OSTK/SFIX Squeezes

Everyone brings up the VW "infinity squeeze" which happened on only a 12.3% Short Interest and 6% of Free float at the time. 

But with GME the short interest is at a ludicrous 97.68% according to Yahoo Finance and the free float is 69%. So the VW squeeze was worse in term of the ratio of short interest to float

I know days to cover is the other really important one, but I can't find any numbers on what it was during the VW squeeze

I'm just trying to figure out what the most important numbers/metrics to pay attention to are

Don’t want to get Jack Ma’d _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Alibaba is UNDERVALUED 🚀🚀🚀 One after another negative catalysts have been annihilating Alibaba’s share price. First it was the [ANT IPO fiasco](https://imgur.com/kDpBPlg) and then it was CCP regulatory concerns. Do you really think the CCP is on a warpath to meaningfully hinder one of their most profitable companies? If so then stop reading here. This is literally a gift from the CCP and here is why.

First lets start off with some fundamental boomer valuation metrics. According to Nasdaq.com here’s a comparison of the two largest e-commerce companies.

————————

ALIBABA Forward P/E:

2021: 30

2022: 23

2023: 17

12 month Forward PEG ratio: 1.46

————————

AMAZON Forward P/E:

2021: 73

2022: 52

2023:(no estimates)

12 month Forward PEG ratio: 3.22

————————-

Aside from the valuation metric comparison above Alibaba has [wonderful financials.](https://imgur.com/a/MX8rA12) YOY increases in cash flow and assets while maintaining low debt as a growth company is very attractive. 

As you can see Alibaba is CRITICALLY undervalued compared to Amazon. When PEG is taken into account with P/E it can justify a currently high P/E IF AND ONLY IF said company is expected to grow earnings fast enough YOY. According to Zack’s the E-commerce industry as a whole has a PEG ratio of about 2.56 which would indicate that Alibaba is undervalued in comparison to not only Amazon but most if not all of its peers as well. Lets also not forget that Alibaba recently increased their [share buyback program from 6 billion to 10 bilion](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/alibaba-raises-stock-buyback-plan-to-10-billion-but-stock-continues-to-sink-11609124627). That's an increase of over 66%.... Even Alibaba themselves thinks their shares are undervalued and wants to take advantage of the recent sell off.

Secondly lets check out the technical side of things. Here is a [weekly chart](https://imgur.com/5ffIMmO) that shows a very attractive uptrending pattern for the last few years. It also shows that Alibaba was overextended and needed a healthy pullback. Now it's oversold and in prime territory for a true dip buy opportunity. An opportunity this large has presented itself just 4 times in a little over 2 years. The huge green candle tells me that after the sell off Alibaba bulls were lying in wait for a moment like this to scoop up more shares.

Lastly  lets break it down in WSB valuation metrics. Daniel Zhang YOLOd his way into an empire and his wife’s boyfriend(The CCP) has noticed that he is incredibly profitable and doesn't seem to be slowing down anytime soon. The wife's boyfriend is starting to fear for his top position in the house. This is why the wife's boyfriend wants to regulate the little autist so that he can maintain power over both his wife and the autist. That said the wife's boyfriend doesn't want to kick the autist out. He still wants to keep the little autist around because he generates money for him while he hangs out with his wife.

TLDR; The CCP wants to make sure it stays in position as the wife's boyfriend. Alibaba is undervalued and presents an opportunity if you believe the CCP regulatory concerns are just smoke and mirrors._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Where are you on the spectrum?? _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ 28k $MTCH YOLO Used up all my savings I’m either going to ☠️ or 🚀🚀🚀 _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Anyone investing TTCF?

Disclaimer I’m in with 600 shares 

- [ ] The most important factors for them going into 2021:
- [ ] Can they pull off their marketing campaign? 
- [ ] Will the plant based movement continue?
IMO yes, its spreading like wildfire in the US, huge demand for it in the UK.
Gen Z and Millenials driving the plant based movement.
They’re very connected with social medias can help spread the name in a massive way
- [ ] Trend will continue to grow stronger.
- [ ] $55B market they’re targeting aggressively to take market share of next year
- [ ] Don’t underestimate the power of brand awareness, this can snowball and be a huge driver for them
- [ ] Can argue brand awareness is what will impact the fundamentals and sp the most
Just scratching the surface of their distribution potential.
Now apparently selling in the UK Costco’s already, US wide expansion aswell as Mexico

Tons of pictures of empty shelves and their products being sold out on social medias

https://skyhighcapitalinvestments.com/the-most-exciting-food-company-for-the-next-decade-and-beyond/

- [ ] This time of year January people tend to eat healthier, the Q1 report should reflect this boost in sales on top of the benefits of their marketing 

Veganuary 
NitroC advertising company 


- [ ] Vertically integrated: 
- [ ] Meaing they produce everything in their products right from the source
- [ ] They grow their own vegetables and ingredients
- [ ] Manuafacture the final product themselves
- [ ] They innovate rapidly and design their own products aswell
- [ ] This is essential to keep ahead of competitors in the food space.

Catalyst’s
Marketing campaign = massive buzz around the brand higher revenue, higher sales.
Biggest catalyst for the history of this company
A lot of positive reviews on social medias like IG and YT
Effect of Marketing campaign really be seen in Q1 earnings 

Undervalued, institutional investors will be loading up on this 

The hype from the SPAC alone has been free advertising 90m in cash from merger 
Cash will be 320m if they call the warrants
(May be exercised next year at some point)companies in their growth stage and attacking a major opportunity. 

Price prediction:

Profitability is not and should not be their main concern which is why I am using Price to sales to compare their valuations:

TTCF have been profitable every quarter also to mention, except Q3 because of one off merger expenses.

Based on P/S ratio:
2021 sp: $45 conservative
          sp: $56 very possible with 3.8B market cap

Q4 potential YOY rev, I have 45
On their analyst day presentation says 39 (conservative)
With them selling out crazy fast in the stores
I can’t see why they won’t smash their Q4 earnings

Currently SKU’s 21 products
Will have 38 products in 2021
This aggressive expansion = more sales = higher revenue

Addressable market is about 50B growing at at 17% CAGR for that market. Their revenue has been about 40-50m quarterly WITHOUT ANY MARKETING AT ALL.
Should be crazy growth once the marketing campaign starts in Jan.

They should be able to maintain and grow these numbers for years to come, innovation is key here and they have the scope to do it.
And the capacity as they’ve double their facility size already and plan to scale up again in 2021 doubling facilities again.

RISKS

Risks - Of course marketing is costly and possibility of it not being successful
But TTCF seem to have a very loyal customer base already and their products actually taste good
Other alternative type products don’t taste that great just loaded with salt. 
Overall very excited for their next earnings report.

There are 20M warrants outstanding. 
If they call the warrants that would be an 85M shares outstanding
So TTCF is 85M shares outstanding and $320M in the bank, accounting for the warrant excercise.
What does this mean for the stock price, it can cause dilution if the warrants are exercised, because the underlying company ie TTCF will have to issue new shares, when there’s more shares the price is diluted by the extra amount of shares created. However in the overall long term picture for TTCF this will be minor.

Conclusion:

In my opinion this a trend that will continue to be strong in 2021, just like what we’ve seen in the EV space. From the start of next year TTCF will be spending aggresively on marketing
Could mean we’ll see some very attractive results in their next Q4, Q1 and onwards earnings reports!!

*****
> Stocks exit 2020 with strong gains and are riding a tailwind, but already in the dawn of the new year, the market could face its first big challenge.
*****
> The final outcome of the 2020 election plays out Tuesday, when voters in Georgia will pick their senators and decide which party controls the U.S. Senate.
*****
> With President-elect Joe Biden heading to the White House and a Democratic-controlled House of Representatives, Wall Street has been comfortable with the view that Biden and the Democrats could not succeed with tax hikes and more progressive policy changes while Republicans hold the Senate.
*****
> The runoff election for the two Senate seats Tuesday is widely expected to result in one or both of the incumbent Republican senators retaining their seats. But Democrats are close in the polls and should they win, each party would have 50 seats with Vice President-elect Kamala Harris the tie breaker.
*****
> “Georgia is the most important thing to the Biden presidency for the next two years,” said Ed Mills, Washington policy analyst at Raymond James. “It’s going to determine what is the legislative agenda and who can get confirmed by the United States Senate.”
*****
> Sen. David Perdue is being challenged by Democrat Jon Ossoff, while GOP Sen. Kelly Loeffler is running against Democrat Raphael Warnock. None of the candidates had more than 50% of the vote in the Nov. 3 election, so Georgia law requires a runoff election between the two leading candidates for each seat.
*****
> “It’s a binary event,” said Mills, adding it’s of growing interest to markets. “The general sense for the market is that Republicans are well positioned to maintain their majority in the Senate. But I think the 2020 election as well as the 2016 election and to some extent, the 2018 election has humbled us … The Senate outcomes, in particular, seem to be less predictable than almost any other elections.”
*****
> Mills said the results may take several days to determine, adding to the uncertainty the event could hold for markets. According to an RBC investor survey, 88% expect Republicans to maintain control, and most say that is a positive for the stock market.
*****
> “The market tends to shoot first and ask questions later. There will certainly be a reaction if Democrats win both those seats,” said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group. Strategists say there could be a relief rally if Republican incumbents see a clear victory.
*****
> “That totally dominates [trading] because it’s about do we have status quo or do we have Democrats controlling all parts of Washington and what that means for spending and taxes,” Boockvar said. “I think you could see the worries about taxes overwhelming any thoughts on the benefits of more spending” by Democrats.
*****
> # By the numbers
> A year of extreme volatility ended with a big win for stocks, as the pandemic steered the course for markets. The S&P 500 was up 16.3% for the year, ending at 3,756. That gain comes after a 34% decline early in the year, followed by a powerful more-than 65% rebound. Technology was the big winner for the year, and the Nasdaq was up 43.6% at 12,888.

> Besides the runoff vote, the market will be watching a stream of data in the coming week, including the important December jobs report Friday. That could show fewer than 100,000 jobs were added as the spreading virus impacted hiring and layoffs. There were 245,000 jobs created in November.
*****
> There is also ISM manufacturing data Tuesday, and a number of Fed speakers, including Vice Chairman Richard Clarida on Friday.
*****
> The virus itself could also be a factor for stocks.
*****
> Conventional wisdom for the coming year has been that vaccines will be widely distributed, and by the second half things will start to get back to normal and the economy will pick up. But the initial distribution has been slow, and far short of the 20 million targeted for December by President Donald Trump’s task force.
*****
> In that recent RBC survey, three quarters of investors were optimistic about vaccine distribution with 80% expecting a majority to be vaccinated by the end of 2021. “We suspect that the positive outlook for the stock market and the economy would deteriorate if expectations for a smooth vaccine rollout are not met,” RBC strategists wrote.
*****
> They also noted that nearly 60% of the investors surveyed believe high stock market valuations are problematic.
*****
> “This suggests to us that any threat to the economic and earnings recovery story could spark profit-taking. On this point, it is worth noting that the vaccine was the No. 1 issue keeping investors up at night, closely followed by monetary policy and excessive optimism on the recovery,” the strategists noted.
*****
> Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank, said investors will also be watching the formal acceptance of the Electoral College vote Wednesday. Strategists expect the vote count to confirm Biden’s presidency.
*****
> However, Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley says he will challenge the certification, and several House Republicans have already vowed to contest the election at that time. If one House member and a senator jointly object to a state’s slate of electors, the two houses of Congress must separately debate and vote on the objection.
*****
> Strategists see little chance of any impact on the election outcome, but there could be fireworks. Trump has been claiming since the election that there was fraud but multiple courts failed to find any truth to the claims.
*****
> Rupkey said investors are not taking into account enough potential for political risk from the deep animosity between the two political parties.
*****
> “I think the additional stimulus and hopes for additional stimulus, and infrastructure spending in 2021, I don’t know that that is such a slam dunk, because of the issue of political instability,” he said.

> # Why A Year-End Rally Bodes Well For 2021

> Welcome to the last day of 2020! It has been a devastating year in so many ways, yet for investors it has been quite rewarding. Much of the gains in 2020 have taken place the final two months, with the S&P 500 Index up more than 14% in November and December so far, the best end to a year since WWII.

> A big end of year rally could have bulls smiling in 2021. “Turns out a 10% or more gain the final two months of the year has equaled a higher S&P 500 the following year every single time since World War II,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “In fact, January was also higher every single time as well, so maybe this strong rally to end the year is a clue for higher prices into next year.”

> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the S&P 500 gained an average of more than 18% the year following a 10% or more surge during the final two months of the year. Meanwhile, January was up 5 for 5 as well, rising an impressive 3% on average.

> Here’s what the average year looks like after the prior year gains 10% or more the final two months compared to a typical year. Once again, strong returns are the playbook historically.

> # Fifty to Zero in 283 Days

> In a year with some pretty crazy charts, the one below is right up there with some of the best. After all the markets have been through this year, bot the S&P 500 and Long-Term Treasuries have seen nearly identical returns on a total return basis. That's right, with just a few hours left in the trading year, the S&P 500's total return in 2020 has been a gain of 17.6%, while Long Term US Treasuries, as measured by the B of A Merrill Lynch Long-Term Treasury Index has rallied 17.3%. What makes this nearly identical performance all the more incredible is that on March 23rd, the performance gap between the two was more than 50 percentage points.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123120-Stocks-Bonds.png))**

> The fact that stocks and bonds have essentially seen identical returns this year isn't typical. The chart below shows the annual performance spread between the S&P 500 and long-term US Treasuries going back to 1978. During that time, the S&P 500 has historically outperformed long-term US Treasuries by an average of 3.9 percentage points per year, but the average gap in performance between the two has been over 15 percentage points. In the 43 years since 1978, there have only been seven other years where the performance spread between the two asset classes was less than five percentage points and just two years (1985 and 1992) where the performance spread was less than a percentage point.

> # Back-to-Back Big Years for Technology

> With just two trading days (including today) left in 2020, the S&P 500 Technology sector is on pace for its second year in a row of rallying more than 40%. Going back to 1990, the only time the Technology sector experienced back-to-back returns of more than 40% was in 1998 and 1999. Back then, not only was the Technology sector up 40%+ in back-to-back years, but it was also up over 75% in both of those years. If you think markets are pretty crazy these days, they still have nothing on the last two years of the 1990s!

> In terms of cumulative returns, the Technology sector is up 210% since the last trading day of 2018, whereas in 1999 it was up 317% in a two-year span. What's also interesting to note about the last 31 years of returns for the Technology sector is how it has only experienced five down years, while the S&P 500 has been down in ten different years during that span. Furthermore, since 2009 there has only been one down year and the decline was a paltry 1.6%. Not a bad 12-year run!

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Technology-Sector-Performance.png))**

> Given that the sector has more than doubled in the last two years, there have been some big individual winners. Topping the list with a gain of just under 400% is Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). On the last day of 2018, AMD traded hands for under $20 per share. Today's it's over $90. AMD has a lead of more than 100 percentage points over the next closest stock - NVIDIA (NVDA) - which is up 288%. Interestingly, there aren't a lot of major outliers to the upside compared to the sector's 210% gain, but that's because Apple (AAPL), the sector's largest stock, has paced the sector's gains by rallying more than 240%.

> On the downside, just four stocks in the Technology sector have declined in the last two years. The worst of these has been DXC Technology (DXC) which has lost more than half of its value, while Juniper (JNPR) and HP Enterprise (HPE) are down between 10% and 20%. Lastly, FLIR Systems (FLIR) has declined less than 2%, so depending on how it acts in the next two days, it could move into positive territory just as Intel (INTC) did yesterday after Third Point bailed it out and moved the stock barely into positive territory for the last two years.

> # Growth Dragging on Small Caps

> In the past couple of weeks, we have frequently been keeping tabs on small-cap equities which have been particularly strong performers of late resulting in very overbought readings as well as extended valuations. More specifically, taking a look at growth-oriented small-caps, with only a couple days left in the year small-cap growth stocks—proxied by the Russell 2000 Growth ETF (IWO)—are on pace to have outperformed large-cap equivalents in 2020. On December 10th, IWO surpassed the S&P 500 Growth ETF (IVW) in terms of YTD performance, and even after pulling back in the past week, IWO is still in the lead.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Small-Large1.png))**

> As a result of recent moves, there has been a sharp reversal on a relative basis between the two ETFs in the past week. In the chart below, we show the ratio of the Russell 2000 Growth ETF (IWO) versus the S&P 500 Growth ETF (IVW). This ratio took off beginning in the early fall meaning small-cap growth drastically outperformed large-cap growth. But the former's weakness in the past several days has put a halt to that move.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Small-Large2.png))**

> As to just how sharp of a reversal this was, in the five days through yesterday's close, the decline in the ratio of IWO to IVW was the largest since June. Before that, April and March saw declines that were even larger. Not only was this one of the biggest drops in the relative performance of small-cap growth to large-cap growth in the past few months, but that also stands in the bottom 0.5% of all readings going back to 2000 when the ETF first began trading. Outside of this past spring, the only other periods that have also experienced this type of underperformance of small-cap growth relative to large-cap growth was at various points in 2011, 2008, and a handful of times in the early 2000s.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Small-Large3.png))**

> Small-cap underperformance has not necessarily been broad though. For value stocks, small caps (IWN) have generally outperformed large caps (IVE) for the entirety of the new bull market. While there was a bit of a turn lower in recent days, it has been nowhere close to as dramatic of a move as growth stocks.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Small-Large4.png))**

> In the charts below, we show average performance over the past week of Russell 2000 stocks broken into deciles based on their price to sales and price to book ratios. As shown, the most aggressively valued deciles have averaged the worst performance in the past week. Stocks with low P/S and P/B ratios have not been immune from the weakness, but they have held up significantly better.

I hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading year ahead r/wallstreetbets._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Tesla reports nearly 500,000 vehicle deliveries for 2020, hitting target _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ CRSR DD - Discounted stock! 🚀🚀🚀 Hi fellow retards and autists,

It is time to quit lurking and give you a DD of my own: CRSR - Corsair Gaming, Inc.

This will be a long read, but fear not I will post a TL;DR section at the end.

Lets start off with something more trivial, but important nonetheless.

1) Management: Maybe you do not know the site “Owler” but one of its features is that members of the website can rank CEOs. Andrew Paul (Corsair’s CEO) has a rating of 92/100. Apart from Andrew the team consists of people believing in the brand and having proven to be successful. Read up on them https://www.corsair.com/us/en/team


2) Market sentiment: It seems people have generally gotten scared last couple of days and letting their hands turn into paper. If you have any position in CRSR, keep it. If not it’s a great time to buy. Although it would seem there is a bearish sentiment on the stock there actually isn’t. Thanks to /u/maxfort86 for making a handy tool for checking options (seems to be down though at the moment) we can see there are actually a lot more call options than puts telling us the sentiment is bullish. Apart from options we can also turn to the general analyst price target on finance.yahoo being a $40,11. It also enjoys a Zacks rank of 1 - Strong buy.
Heck even /u/SIR_JACK_A_LOT became a millionaire with the stock and loaded back in 5 days ago and although some people think he dumped, I’m pretty sure he’s going to ride it with me to a PT of $55-$60 unless it rockets hard and well than we’ll just strap in for more %.
So even if it follows conservative analysts you can make over 10% in a pretty short term without actually making full on retarded plays.


3) Earnings date: They crushed their last earning report and nothing tells us the next one is going to be different. It is estimated that they will report earnings feb 09, 2021. The moment they will report their earnings you know this sucker is gonna soar. They almost doubled their previous consesus EPS and the way things are going I believe they will beat it again easily since the next consesus EPS is still lower then the realised one for Q3 and as I said nothing really changed or will change by then. Corona still got a lot of people at home and more and more people are buying equipment for pcs and also breaking them through more (sometimes abusive) usage. More sales = more profit = stonk go up.


4) Confirmation bias: Who doesn’t love hearing they are right? Well everything is screaming that CRSR is going to make moves, yes it is discounted now and heck maybe it’ll discount a little further a maximum of 10%, but the reward surely outweighs the risk on this one. Everyone is saying this is a must buy and will rise back sooner than later. Just look at finance.yahoo or zacks like I mentioned or any other of the gazilion sites that exist. None of them are saying this stock isn’t going to go up, the contrary is very much true in this case.


Disclaimer: I am not a professional or financial adviser, if you want to buy the stock because of the DD it is at your own risk. These are my convictions not a sure prediction of the market.


Positions: 488 stocks @ 37,39, don’t dabble in options.


TL;DR; buy stonk, make money. Hold longer, make more money 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ 8k on $TSLA calls expiring 1/8 _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ So it’s year of the Ox = Bull year = we go to the moon!! 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 All aboard retards _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ BBBY earnings report swing What's everyone's thoughts on BBBY for a short term trade this week?

The price is currently at a strong support at 18.04 with a top end resistance of 25.04. A good earnings report Friday could see a sound slingshot up 38%.

Solar spot discussion and what does it mean for the financial market?

As we all know, the sun controls our lives and financial markets. Recently we have passed the halfway point of the solar activity trough. Because of this, I am predicating that SPY will reach 430 dollars by the end of 2021, as we leave the bearish cycle of the sun and enter the hyper sunshin bullrun. These are fundamentals, since the sun is a fundamental indication of our financials. -- yes I am not a fucking notradomeass for predicting stocks go up. Also made username in 2019.

1. Huge EV+ risk that is largely uncorrelated to market risk (short squeeze).  Even low probability of outcome makes more effort and capital worth it.  Piling on the trade actually increases its likelihood.

2. Fundamentals and activist investor (Cohen) give, at minimum, a plausible semi-bluff on turnaround.  May make errors but error will not be Blockbuster one.

3. Chart technicals are incredible.  5x move but still largely invisible except to /wsb.  1.35B market cap gives face validity to 10x return even with move that already happened.   

4. Perception of silliness and dismissal around threat have made short sellers prone to errors and more likely to pay off big.

For poker folks, it reminds me of holding a big flush draw.    It may not come through, but the possibility allows us to bet aggressively and potentially take the pot even without the hand.  If it hits, we can potentially entice our opponent to pay off big later.   Plus our opponent doesn't take us seriously, increasing their chance of overvaluing their ability to bluff us out.

Dear GME gang 🚀,

I wanted to share my Price Targets (PT) for GME but no BS here. I give you my PT according to actual facts.

Let’s take a look at the table and check when the short % of free float went from a high point (\~160%) at around February 2020 to a low point (\~140%) - which by the way they, in absolute terms,  both are huge numbers of course - I won't talk about the potential short-squeeze here (I will publish the ultimate DD on GME TOMORROW and talk about it in here, stay tuned).

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/f72yer03mx861.png?width=414&format=png&auto=webp&s=daf02cf200c7f1c1722a7e55dc6c02138f1dd2de

The stock went up \~94% **BUT** most of the gain took place at 2 key moments: at the recovery of the market crash and then in late August which shows that 💎🙌-ing is key to capture most of the gains. Why do I say this? Because when holding the stock at the time you could “feel” like you bled all along esp. when you watch the stats:

*Positive daily returns:          49.3%*

*Negative daily returns:         50.7%*

BUT IT WAS IN FACT THE SHORT SELLERS WHO BLED HARD. CHECK THIS OUT:

*Best daily return:                   23.0 %*

*Worst daily return:                -13.7 %*

Imagine you sold GME when the -13.7% happened. You would not have captured the 94% returns. So just 💎🙌 and let those shorts go bankrupt.

Okay, here I showed **FACTS**. Stuff that actually happened. Now here is **my opinion about a reasonable price target** according to the data.

I think we could **easily** hit +80% over the next 6 months when the short % of free float will return to 140% it makes **a lower bound PT of $34 without a short-squeeze**. But this doesn’t even account for the fact that some short-sellers will not be able to hold from here. Keep in mind that some shorts have a triple-digit % drawdown already.

# Conclusion

**Price targets for the 3-6 next months according to the data from 2019-2020 (assuming the short float drops by 20%)** :

* Conservative:  $34 without a short-squeeze (+80%)  🚀
* Likely to happen: $50 without a short-squeeze (+180%) 🚀🚀
* Optimist:  $70 without a short-squeeze (+372%) 🚀🚀🚀

So I'd suggest that for those of you who DO NOT believe in a short-squeeze to put a take profit at around 70-80$.

Note that these are price targets assume the short % of free float go down to \~140%, if it goes to 130% or even less the price could go up substantially more. And...

**Keep in mind that my PTs are overall all VERY CONSERVATIVE given that:**

1. I DIDN'T even account for the fact that the next earnings will be good/great.
2. I didn’t even account for the fact that Ryan Cohen’s stake is now at 12.9% - those will NOT be sold, so the potential sell-pressure will be LESS than before = bullish.
3. With a short-squeeze I have actually no idea where this could go but again **very easily $100+**.

**I WILL PUBLISH THE ULTIMATE DD ON GME TOMORROW BE SURE TO CHECK THIS OUT (100% TENDIES, 0% BS IN HERE).**

**Positions**: a lot of shares. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Disclamer for the bears:  I only try to make the best PT estimations and share it with you all. I do my estimation, not by technical analysis but with actual data and what I believe to be the best hypothesis (short float will decrease by 20%). By no means I am saying I can see into the future unlike some people seem to think. I thought it was obvious but I must clarify it apparently. Anyway, I put my money where my mouth is and I share my personal insights that's it. If you really think I am wrong, by all means go ahead and buy some puts or short the stock, I'll be glad, the money you will lose is the money we will earn._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ I can finally post my loss of 20k!

What else_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Just letting you know the bullshit behind clean energy: be long on big oil *DISCALIMER: If you want to learn about this in more depth and want to verify my claims, this is a link of a TED conference from a seasoned enviromentalist who explains these issues in details (*[*https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-yALPEpV4w*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-yALPEpV4w)*), but for the purpose of wsb, I will keep this post nice and short and focus on what really matters: money. Also english is not my native language, so forgive any errors*

In the last few years there's been a lot of speculation around the shift to renewables. A lot of people are bullish on solar, wind an EVs and are very bearish on big oil companies. I'm going to explain to you why **the government(s) shift to "clean energy" and the recent oil crisis  is actually very bullish for big oil in the medium to long term**.

# Renewables cannot exist without oil

Basically as it turns out, **current tech for solar and wind sucks big time**, and it probably will for decades to come. Not only they are nowhere near as enviromentally sustainable as nuclear power (because they need lots of terrain,  use 20x more resources than nuclear fission power plants, and there are recycling issues), but most importantly, these green plants depend on the sun shining and the wind blowing, so **they can only run and produce energy about 30% of the time.** The key here is that there is no real efficient way (no, pumping and dumping water is not efficient) to have these plants running without coupling them with fossil fuel burning regular plants, beacuse otherwise the electric power grid would be a mess. **So the real reason that all these oil companies are fine with the government shifting to green energy is that, to run this utopia of solar panels, wind turbines, and EVs, you'll still need their oil**. In fact, these companies are the ones that are lobbying politicians (in particular democrats, in the US case), persuading it to pursue this "green" bullshit instead of going with real less harmful choice, which is regular old nuclear energy.

# The 2020 oil price shock benefits BIG oil companies in the long run

The oil price disaster in march might cause a short term problem with oil companies, but **BIG oil companies rubbed their hands**. Maybe the small oil companies or the ones with lots of debt can face problems and go out of business, but **the GIANT with a healthy balance sheet can survive the crisis and have even more market share**. You have to think about this as if oil companies were coffee shops. During corona, many closed and never opened again becaus eof bankrupcty, so the ones that had lots of cash available before the big hit, the big players like Starbucks, will benefit when there is full or partail reopening of the economy.

# Oil demand will not shrink that much

If people knew that **oil is not just used for powering engines**, they probably wouldn't have such a negative outlook on oil demand. Guys, oil is fucking used to build anything that is made out of **plastic**. Even to make some **medications** you need stuff that comes from oil. To get all the useless shit that the west buys from India and China, you'll still need oil to power **container ships** that sail the ocean. Once this corona shit is over, people will still buy plane tickets to go on vacation. Sure, maybe business trips will take a permanent hit and there be slightly less demand due to the transition to "green", BUT, as we said earlier, green still needs it .... and we are still not adressing the elephant in the room: there are massive **emerging markets economies** growing in the worild today, a lot of second and third world countries that will still rely on oil for their initial growth for decades. These countries will offset the loss of demand from developed nations. Shit, general commodities prices have been skyrocketing recently. You wanna jump on steel gang and not on oil gang? The only way oil prices fall from here is if OPEC shits the bed.

# The play

As long as this obsession for and complete ignorance and denial on how to solve climate change continues, and as long as the goverments of the west are corrupt and cannot see that they need to boost nuclear power and public transportation instead of solar, wind and EVs, big oil companies with a heathy balance sheet will be fine in the next decade. **Many oil companies are trading at or below book value, with massive dividend yields**, it won't stay like this forever. Do yourself a favour and be long on **RDS, XOM, BP, TOT, CVX and maybe even the italian E**. Saw a lot of hedge funds buying **OXY** in the past few months for some reason. Either buy shares, and if you are a brave man use leverage. I wouldn't advise options on this one since we don't know when the catalyst for the rally will come, and one of the main points of the play is to get that juicy dividend. If you just need to use options, use LEAPS for the love of god. I expect a return of AT LEAST 20% on the shares alone, maybe even a lot more.

**TLDR: shift to solar and wind will actually benefit supermassive oil companies with healthy balance sheets that can weather the current crisis**_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ How Zapp Brannigan defeated Melvin Capital and the evil short bots in the battle for GME _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Hyliion is poised to take the reins of trucking. Here I will explain why I think Hyliion (HYLN) is poised to take on the long haul trucking sector. Gonna put the **TLDR** up front for those who don't want to read through all of it. Will address with what (I think) is great for this company. *Notice!* This is going to be a long post and the position I'm taking on this company is long.

**TLDR:  With Joe Biden elected and his "green" policies at the forefront of his agenda, EV and other "green" companies will have a boost. Hyliion being in the beginning of this "green" era in the right place at the right time, will capitalize on this with IP they own to save long haul truck operators money on gas and operating costs.**

&#x200B;

1. **The Long Haul Cost**

  Long Haul truck operators (Class 8) are those big trucks you see backing up into Walmart to deliver potatoes and tendies, these trucks are the life blood of supply across states. On Average Class 8 trucks get "6.4 mpg" and on the higher end get [10 mpg.](https://www.fleetowner.com/running-green/fuel/article/21701045/run-on-less-were-averaging-101-mpg-in-class-8-trucks) Now if all (1.7 million) U.S. and Canadian trucks were efficient to get to 10 mpg they would save over " 9.7 billion gallons of diesel and [$](https://gyazo.com/df62034df85c5d780b431561d9ff17a3)24 billion dollars" The trucks are equipped with a system to save money  for the customers and is almost akin to what a Prius does with its battery and engine with the added benefit of having software to control and manage the system. Here is video showing live video of there product being [used](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=XPRQ1rKrB_Q). With the addition that most truckers need a minimum of 600 miles a day since many companies that employ truck drivers pay them by the miles and anything less is losing money. With Hyliion using there hybrid system (and there fully green truck, which I will talk about in another section) they can get to market faster than other manufactures since they wont be designing a truck from the ground up. Here is a truckers perspective on Hyliion and there technology.   [Trucker Perspective](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRGp7PanqYc&feature=youtu.be)  
 

   2.  **The Product** 

The company is spearheaded by Thomas Healy, a tubby young guy with a vision. Hyliion intends to offer the retrofit to trucks to save on gas and has regenerative braking to slow the truck as well as charging it when slowing down or going down a slope, unlike other truck makers just getting into this field, there truck is not powered by gravity and [runs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7PUlGkF5Jw)  under its own power. With more companies and new auto manufactures opting to go into EVs Hyliion is in a great spot for the future market. The batteries used in there trucks were purchased from the **Gentherm Battery Division** and with a battery  that lasts over 4,000 charge/ discharge cycles with a 10 year life. [Hyliion](https://www.ttnews.com/articles/hyliion-acquires-gentherms-battery-division) has also partnered with **Toshiba** "for its battery cell technology and with Dana Inc. for cooling technology to improve the thermal management of the batteries." Hyliion also owns there own patents on the tech, so no third parties. List includes 69+ [patents](https://patents.google.com/?assignee=Hyliion&oq=Hyliion) .

3. **Building out**

Like most companies in the beginning, they have to scale manufacturing. Hyliion is just beginning to build out to secure contracts. They have a preorder from Agility, one of the leaders in trucking here in the United States and a partnership with [ANG natural](https://investors.hyliion.com/news/news-details/2020/Hyliion-Announces-Natural-Gas-Fueling-Partnership-with-American-Natural-Gas/default.aspx) gas for their eventual hypertruck ERX which mainly runs off of natural gas. The infrastructure for natural gas is as abundant as diesel is which makes it readily available. Buy it today, drive it tomorrow. Unlike battery proposed solutions like the Tesla semi, or the Hydrogen Cell truck from Scam Nikola, the infrastructure exists to fuel these trucks once they become available. They also support a version of fuel cell in there truck for the [generator](https://www.hardworkingtrucks.com/hyliion-ceo-electric-hypertruck-powertrain-will-offer-fuel-cell-generator-in-addition-to-nat-gas/).(ERX only) Many more potential customers include **CAT, Agility, Mone, Penske, and Ryder.** 

As it stands right HYLN has a price target of [20$](https://seekingalpha.com/news/3644804-hyliion-holdings-rallies-after-barclays-charges-in-bull-rating) . But trades less than that, these are near the lows as the lowest its gone was 15.

If you are pretty sure about what the trajectory of the Georgia Senate Runoffs will be, you can make money. Scroll to the bottom for the plays.**  




**Introduction:**  
Recall the price action of QQQ (the tech etf we all know about) around Nov. 3. If you can't because you're that guy from the movie [Memento](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memento_(film)) , pull out your Robinhood app and follow along with me kid:

On the eve of the general election, when most polls indicated that it would be a Democratic sweep, **QQQ sat at $269.** The next day, with the election contested, **QQQ rocketed to $294.** It remained steady on Friday, before declining the next week. 

Why did the election affect the price the way that it did? It is because Biden's legislative agenda depends on Democratic control of Congress. **In particular, a simple majority in the Senate allows President-elect Biden to raise corporate taxes to 28%, which [he has promised to do](https://joebiden.com/two-tax-policies/)**. These corporate taxes would heavily affect tech companies.


  
To explain, the institutional whales (the folks who actually move markets) believe that:

- Companies that benefitted bigly from Trump's tax cuts (tech companies especially) will be hurt by Biden raising taxes.
* Companies that would benefit from fiscal stimulus (green new deal, infrastructure) will be helped by Biden's plans, and even more if Biden controls Congress.  
* Regardless of who controls the Senate, the divided nature means some companies are guaranteed to benefit.



Don't take my word for it. Read this report from Goldman Sachs (p.15-16): https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/pages/beyond-2020-post-election-policies-f/report.pdf  



Originally, tech companies (facing more regulation and tax increases under the Democratic Trifecta) were trending down. But when it seemed that the Republicans would hold the Senate with a 51 seat-majority, tech stocks made a sharp U-turn

Yet, there was a small blip downward the very next week. This was not a circumstantial correction. It happened because David Perdue (R) in Georgia fell below the threshold to prevent a Jan. 5 runoff, leaving the Republican majority at 50, and injecting the slim possibility for the Democrats to still fully control Congress.  

Now let's jump to the week ahead:

**Right now, Democrats control 48 seats in the U.S. Senate. If they can win both Georgia Senate runoffs on Jan. 5, they will have 50 seats.** With Vice-President Harris as the tie-breaker, they would be able to pass Democratic legislation like tax increases. **In other words, the outcome of this election would have a huge impact on certain stocks.**
&nbsp;

**Which stocks are impacted, and why**

If Democrats gain control of the U.S. Senate, that means Biden can pass his legislation.

* Some companies will be helped bigly (e.g. Renewables)
* Some companies may be hurt (more taxes) but also helped (more fiscal spending)
* Some companies may be hurt bigly (more taxes, regs, and less gov't subsidies)

To make this a pure election-related play, we want to trade:

* companies that benefit bigly from Democratic legislation (and don't have short-term non-political risk)
* companies that are hurt bigly from Democratic legislation (and don't have short-term non-political risk)

So what companies benefitted the most from Trump's tax cuts? (Source: Goldman Sachs Client note)  

* Tech companies like Netflix, which saw its effective tax rate go from 23% to 7%.
* Railroad companies like CSX, which saw its effective tax rate go from 37% to 23%.
* Healthcare companies like HCA, which saw its effective tax rate go from 32% to 20%.
* Pure financial companies like CME, saw their effective tax rate go from 36% to 23%.

Obviously, pandemic-related questions muddle price-action on healthcare. At the same time, there is still some policy uncertainty to what will happen to railroads regardless of the outcome of the runoffs (they will have higher taxes, but that may be offset by stimulus/infrastructure spending). That leaves two sectors as our pure election plays:

* Tech companies will get more regulation and higher taxes if Biden takes Senate
* Financials will get more regulation and higher taxes if Biden takes Senate

Out of those sectors, specific companies may be overvalued or undervalued, and other concerns may matter more than legislative impact by the U.S Congress. For example, BABA is a tech company in QQQ, but as a Chinese company it sure isn't going to impacted much by U.S. tax legislation. We can just ignore it.

However, a U.S. company like NFLX which is a bit overpriced and very exposed to a tax-cut rollback, is an excellent bear trade for a Democratic Senate scenario (especially if corporate tax increases start being mentioned). While MSFT, which is slightly under-valued and also exposed to tax increases, may be a good trade against a Democratic Senate.

&nbsp;
  
**Information about the races to consider:**

* In the November General election:
	* Perdue (R) won **49.7 percent** of the vote, while Ossoff (D) won **47.9 percent**. In other words, Ossoff substantially underperformed Biden.
	* The Republican candidates (Loeffler + Collins) won a combined **49.4 percent**, while the Democratic candidates (Warnock et al) won a combined **48.4 percent**.
	* **These are both substantial leads for the incumbent Republican Senators.**
* What the "reputable" polls say about Jan. 5:
	* Republican-leaning **Trafalgar Group** ("most accurate pollster of 2016"), which had Trump up 3-4% in its November poll, has now pegged **both the Democratic candidates leading slightly in its late December poll.**
	* Democratic-leaning Survey-USA (which has pretty accurate polling) had Biden up 1-2% in its last general election poll, is now predicting **a Democratic sweep** of both Senate seats
	* Poll to Watch: AJC/UGA, with polling by UGA Professor Trey Hood (the most accurate major poll for Georgia this year). **This will be released soon.**
* Trump has been calling the runoff "invalid", which might mean some of his supporters could boycott the election.
* The Rev. Raphael Warnock is currently in divorce proceedings, and was recently accused by his wife of running over her foot with his car. Watch for whether this gains any traction (or at least enough to sway swing voters)


**The plays:**

- If you expect **both Democratic Senate candidates to sweep** (both 2%+), then AGGRESSIVELY short QQQ, NFLX, CME, and long green energy + industrials (e.g. etfs like TAN and Solar stocks like ENPH). I would buy weekly Jan. 8 FD puts.
* If you expect **both Democratic Senate candidates to win** (both 0.5%+), short QQQ, NFLX, CME. I would buy puts for Jan. 15/22, since the counting might drag on a few days.
* If you expect **Republicans to comfortably hold at least one seat**, long QQQ (specifically NFLX, FB, and MSFT) for Jan. 15. An OTM bear put spread is recommended, but calls should be fine.
* If you expect **Republicans to sweep**, long QQQ and short green energy for Jan. 15. Use synthetic long options strategies if you can, as those are not affected by vega contraction.
* If you expect it to be **nail-bitingly close**, and unclear whether Republicans can hold at least one seat (think month-long recount), long vega on QQQ, e.g. NFLX with a bearish tilt. This would be buying OTM puts, or buying a medium-term strangle. 
* If you expect Trump to still be President on Jan 22 following the events of Jan. 6, aggressively short SPY and long MAGA because a civil war is probably coming.



**FAQ:**

**Q: What is the expected outcome?**  
A: Republicans win, but there is enough uncertainty that you can definitely make money.

**Q: Why bother trading an election?**  
A: This is largely a binary event. A candidate either wins or they don't. This beats trading earnings, as often we could get the earnings result right, but still get cucked by guidance. Moreover, as shown by what has been happening in recent years, the market is often no longer sure of the outcome.

**Q: Why is NFLX a particularly good short in the event of a Democratic sweep?**  
A: Netflix has a fairly simple business model. Its value is dependent on the expected number of subscribers, the monthly price they pay minus the server cost per subscriber, the amount of its business costs to produce shows, and the tax rate. So let's go through these one by one:

* Unlike when it was still a growing company, or at the start of the pandemic, it's unlikely for NFLX to suddenly see unexpected explosive increases in its subscriber base in the short term. 
* Moreover, they only recently increased prices a while back, so it's fairly unlikely for them to announce price increases within the next two weeks. 
* Their costs are unlikely to change drastically, since show production budgets are generally fixed. 
* As a company with a low worker count, you won't see any Congressperson arguing for tax carveouts or subsidies in the way automakers or airlines would. Sure, when they produce shows, there is an economic benefit to certain communities at places where shows, but shows are always temporarily (~3 seasons) and tax subsidies are generally done by local governments, not federal.
* As a largely B2C company, they can't structure their revenue to take advantage of tax loopholes that companies with B2B segments can. Indeed, this was why the corporate tax cuts benefitted them so much, and why a tax raise will hurt them._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ 2020 to the moon. 2021 to Mars. _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ MORE REWARDS!!! $GME _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ I made a tool that shows the most popular options, most bullish days, and most bearish days for any ticker There are a lot of websites that provide options chain but I couldn't find any that sorts or aggregates data the way I wanted. So I made one myself.

[This tool](https://www.maptimum.com/tools/most-popular-options.php) takes all available options for a ticker into account and

1. Finds the top 5 options (call or put) with the highest popularity (open interest) across all strike prices and expiration dates.
2. Finds the most popular strike prices for calls and for puts (all dates combined)
3. Finds the most bullish and the most bearish days. I define the most bullish days as the days with the highest surplus of deep (strike 10% above current price) OTM calls to deep OTM puts (strike 10% below current price).
4. Cheapest/Most Expensive options.

This can help you decide quickly what option to go for if you're the type of person who feels more comfortable following the crowd.

Here are the results for [GME](https://www.maptimum.com/tools/most-popular-options.php?ticker=GME): Most popular option: 24P 1/15/2021, Most bullish day: 2/19/2021, Most bearish day: 1/8/2021

Let me start out by saying that whenever someone like the Motley Fool puts out an article about why this stock or that stock is a sure thing / is not recommended / is a dumpster fire, I have the urge to do the opposite of their recommendations out of sheer spite. And, indeed, those guys put out an [article](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/12/22/why-moderna-stock-plunged-today/) wondering why MRNA took a dive about a week ago. No firm conclusions from them, other than the fact that Moderna isn't on their list of the top ten best stocks which might have been drawn up by a haruspex for all I know.

Anyways.

I'm serious when I say that I think Moderna is undervalued. And I don't have any financial interests in this post, either. Mostly I'm trying to psych myself up because, hey, maybe I'm not talking nonsense. Their stock price just looks absolutely bonkers.

Everyone who bought Moderna at its peak a month ago has been keeping up with the news. No doubt most of you have been watching red numbers in horror. (I'm sure there's at least one bear who's sitting nicely on some puts, but I don't know how many people put their money down on what would've been a very risky wager. It can't be zero.) Moderna got its emergency use authorization from the FDA awhile back; they're not the only company with a COVID vaccine, though, and the headlines for Moderna since then have been pretty bad (in comparison with, say, Pfizer). Many vaccines have side effects, but then you hear about the fact that [side effects with the Moderna vaccine are super common for people with dermal implants](https://www.health.com/condition/infectious-diseases/coronavirus/moderna-vaccine-facial-filler), and every now and then you'll see an article about [some frontline worker getting hospitalized after their Moderna-powered vaccination](https://www.oregonlive.com/coronavirus/2020/12/moderna-coronavirus-vaccine-triggers-severe-allergic-reaction-in-wallowa-county-health-care-worker-officials-say.html) (there's more than one example, that's just the most recent). And the investors are panicking.

Investors, of course, are stupid sheep, because this stuff is nothing new. Remember back in 1976 when [an outbreak of the swine flu caused the Ford administration to push through a vaccine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1976_swine_flu_outbreak), then some people who got the vaccine ended up with Guillain-Barré syndrome, ironically causing people to freak out even more? You know how many people actually suffered serious side effects? A few hundred. Out of literally millions -- about 25% of the US population, including President Ford himself, received the vaccine. What happened was basically the worst-case scenario and the chances of any single person getting their nervous system mangled was still infinitesimal. You'd literally have a better chance of being struck by lightning. (Lightning, for what it's worth, doesn't usually kill, either.)

Yeah, maybe people who have had cosmetic surgery recently should be careful with the Moderna vaccine. That's nothing. Most people will need to wait their turn anyways, as healthcare workers will largely continue to get the first doses. I don't know if the majority of Americans will have a chance at vaccination before the end of the coming year. For every scaremongering news article reporting on (relatively uncommon) side effects, you get a bunch of other articles about how, say, [Moderna's vaccine was just used to vaccinate a senior living facility](https://katv.com/news/local/moderna-vaccine-administered-at-little-rock-senior-living-facility). (I have no idea about the ratio -- can't be bothered to do the math -- but you should also keep in the mind the old adage of "if it bleeds, it leads.") Hell, the biggest risk associated with Moderna's vaccine is probably wastage from negligence or malice, [like what happened with that pharmacist in Wisconsin](https://www.npr.org/2020/12/31/952536531/pharmacist-arrested-accused-of-destroying-more-than-500-moderna-vaccine-doses). Dude straight-up destroyed 550 doses. Big yikes, as the kids say.

I feel like if I don't watch myself I'll veer off into a tangent about vaccine safety in general and other fun topics that're suited for a good ramble. The main point is this: Moderna's still putting out vaccines. They finished Phase 3 trials very, very recently. The verdict? [It works](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/moderna-announces-publication-results-pivotal-142200437.html). If you get COVID you could get seriously fucked up, as the poor souls in the placebo group cofirmed, and the people in the vaccine group all lived. Oh, yeah, and the Department of Defense is buying up doses under some cushy government contract. That probably means something.

Maybe it's just my gut that says a company which has put out a viable COVID vaccine shouldn't have its stock continue to tank indefinitely. The trend line of MRNA prices has been steadily [down since early December](https://i.imgur.com/xSLwIJM.png). In the last few days, though, I think I see the barest [hint of an inflection point](https://i.imgur.com/8tb2XQp.png). In the [past day, even](https://i.imgur.com/z2fIQT1.png).

Or maybe I'm seeing things and it'll continue to slide. If you think that I'm wrong, go ahead and take out a whole bunch of puts, see if you're not too late to pull in a profit. I don't care. I just hope fewer people will be dying from COVID from now on.

PLTR is going to the moon 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 you can click off now if thats all you needed to know, but if you’re curious why this technology is the future, keep reading.

**ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IS MORE “ARTIFICAL” THAN “INTELLIGENT”**

As has been dutifully noted by many fellow autists, Palantir is an artificial intelligence/algorithim data mangement software company. However, you don’t quite have to worry about your wife going off and getting a robot boyfriend anytime soon. While this may come to a surprise to Jeffery Epstein’s pal Steve Hawking[who believed robots will soon take over the world](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.newsweek.com/stephen-hawking-named-epstein-unsealed-files-virginia-giuffre-ghislaine-maxwell-1521920%3famp=1)  smart people in the field have been dealing with solving the problems of making artificial intelligence work for decades. This is good news for all those that have diamond hands 💎👐 on their Palantir shares in the coming years, because one of the founders solved one of the major problems over a decade ago and I’ll tell you how.


**The problem with Artificial Intelligence and the Palantir Solution**


If you aren’t yet familiar with [Stephen Cohen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Cohen_(entrepreneur)) you should be. This is the ultimate autist chad that coded the first prototype of Palantir in 8 weeks. At his time at Stanford, he studied machine learning and artifical intelligence (this was way back in 2005, these beasts of nature are always 20~ years ahead of the normie media and their trends). However, as Cohen himself mentions in his talk at Stanford [“The Path to Palantir”](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=g_6_kGDdjwI) he became dissapointed studying AI due to the many limitations of the field he quickly realized. Firstly, the AI is only ever as smart as the algorithms that the humans were able to develop, thus more “artificial” than “intelligent.” Secondly, while computers are able to store and calculate numbers even faster than an autist doing his math homework before his mom will let him have his tendies, and their superior skill at storing this information, computers cannot grasp numerous concepts that human’s are skilled at. Most fundamentally, this is creativity and anything that is subjective. The example Cohen uses in his speech is hunger. Try explaining the feeling of hunger to someone and while you may be able to quantify it as a number between 1-10, this quantification leaves a lot out that someone that has never experienced hunger would not begin to understand. To put it simply, there are numerous factors in life that are impossible for a computer to quantify. Computers are good at factors they can quantify (numbers) but are as retarded as your average WSB bottom feeder when it comes to the qualitative (subjective). This is where Palantir comes in. Effectively, Palantir solves the quantitative issues for the human and lays it out for humans to interact with and add in qualitative analysis. Palantir is a marriage between a computer’s impeccable ability to process and store numbers and data and humans impeccable ability to use creativity and view context as well as the subjective. 


**Software & Business: The Dinosaur Superstructure**


Heres where our other founder bellwether [Peter Thiel ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Thiel) comes in. If you haven’t heard of him yet, your girlfriend probably doesn’t you stay out past 8 PM, even when she’s not home. Member of the paypal mafia, when hes not busy making billions with his buddies musk and bezos, he’s [taking down Gawker with Hulk Hogan ](https://www.forbes.com/sites/mattdrange/2016/06/21/peter-thiels-war-on-gawker-a-timeline/?sh=78387f3251c5)for outing his private sex life. Like how Cohenknows how computer’s work, Thiel knows how businesses work. How many people here have been in an actual office building? Probably not the right crowd, I know, most of you still live in your parent’s basement, but that won’t matter when PLTR moons. Anyway, one of the first things youll notice is that the majority of technology used by businesses and governments are older than the average /r/teenagers poster. [According to research conducted by Kaspersky, “four in ten of very small businesses (VSB), and roughly half of small and medium-sized businesses (SMB), still rely on operating systems such as Windows XP or Windows 7 which are nearing their end of life.”](https://www.itproportal.com/amp/news/businesses-still-dependent-on-outdated-software/) For some reason, I cannot find similar statistics for even larger companies that would be more likely for Palantir to be working with, but i’d wager from experience and knowing the scaleability issues that come with updating to technology, especially when dealing with a bunch of boomers, that it would be even higher for large companies. However, this is great news, because our good friend Thiel has the perfect formula to grab the biggest 6000 businesses by the balls.


Essentially, Palantir fronts the costs of installing and getting the software embedded into an operation in it’s “acquisition contract” stage. Im not a finance frog, but from what I understand they don’t actually make money from these contracts. Hence why they haven’t been profitable. However, the model is like a snowball. After the acquisition contract has expired, the boomers running the operation Palantir is contracting to have finally figured out how to use the software without training wheels and it is entrenched in their companies business. A larger contract with higher margins is signed. [Further, companies of that companies competition look at what Palantir has done for that company, such as when in Q3 Palantir found 315m in unnecessary spending for an oil and gas company, slotting to save the company 1b in the coming 12 months](https://investors.palantir.com/news-details/2020/Palantir-Reports-Revenue-Growth-of-52-in-the-Third-Quarter-Raises-Full-Year-2020-Guidance/default.aspx) and they are forced to sign an acquisition contract, further pushing the snowball along and acting as a case study of success for Palantir. 


Remember to diamond hands and buy that dip. The markets are an unmedicated bipolar teenaged girl on her period and currently Palantir is in a downswing, but that is only a buying opportunity for the wise of us. Short term, I could see Palantir dipping as low as $20. This negative feedback loop will be broken either by a new contract, Karp interview day, another media announcement, or demo day. Eventually. I’ll lose a lot of you here, if I already havent, but hold strong and don’t stress the short term as long as you agree with my thesis and have done/seen enough due diligence of your own to understand the fundamentals of this company are as solid as Karp’s skiing legs. Longer term, I can see this company being at 100b+ market cap being conservative.

**Dec 17, 2020** \- Bill Ackman follows SpaceX on Twitter (For enthusiast of Yolo style DD)

[https://www.reddit.com/r/PSTH/comments/ke2jrx/bills\_just\_trying\_to\_troll\_us\_now/](https://www.reddit.com/r/PSTH/comments/ke2jrx/bills_just_trying_to_troll_us_now/) 

**Analysis:**

In 2018 Musky needs $10 billion to complete Starlink's global constellation. By 2019 SpaceX had filed for 42,000 satellites but are accused of trying “to drown the ITU in studies so they can go ahead and operate Starlink under FCC sharing rules while ignoring the ITU first to file rules” ([https://twitter.com/TMFAssociates/status/1183436364974419968](https://twitter.com/TMFAssociates/status/1183436364974419968)) At this point I believe that funding methods were being discussed and the possibility of a Starlink spin off was proposed. 

February 6, SpaceX president Gwynne Shotwell expresses this sentiment at the JP Morgan event. I think it was still only speculative and Musk would basically refute this March 9 at the Satellite 2020 conference saying he was thinking about it “zero”. In August SpaceX reported raising $1.9 billion in private funding. This plus funding series J though M equals around $3.2 billion.([https://craft.co/spacex/funding-rounds](https://craft.co/spacex/funding-rounds)) 

By the end of September Musk tweeted "We will probably IPO Starlink, but only several years in the future when revenue growth is smooth & predictable” and that “I’m a huge fan of small retail investors. Will make sure they get top priority. You can hold me to it."

Did something occur between March and September that changed zero to probably? Bill Ackman’s SPAC Pershing Square Tontine Holdings (PSTH) IPOs July 22. A blank check company with $5-7 billion to spend, specific acquisition requirements, and marketed as “the most investor friendly SPAC in the world.” Despite no announced target, there are substantial investments by Guggenheim, Baupost, Soroban, etc. ([https://money.cnn.com/quote/shareholders/shareholders.html?symb=PSTH&subView=institutional](https://money.cnn.com/quote/shareholders/shareholders.html?symb=PSTH&subView=institutional))

In October, Momentus announced it will go public through a reverse merger with Stable Road. Their partnership with SpaceX and backing by Prime Movers Lab establishes a tenuous connection between Musk and Ackman as well as aligning interests.

In December, after reports that SpaceX was seeking funding to double its valuation to $92 billion, Musk coyly responds “Incorrect.” The following day u/Mobiledead posts a screenshot of Bill Ackman following SpaceX on Twitter. 

When I read the PSTH=SpaceX speculation I wrote it off as being as likely as Subway or Pornhub. But when I looked into the timeline of the various threads, there were some stars that seemed to align for Starlink. Bill Ackman was offering the right amount to help complete Starlink’s constellation. The $5-7 billion could fit the 10-20% minority share he intended to acquire with the SPAC depending on how much of SpaceX's valuation is derived from Starlink. Ackman would take the largest SPAC to date and bring internet connection to the entire world cementing his legacy as an investor and an activist. Musk would be able to stop funneling money from his true passion with SpaceX, the Mars mission. And most importantly even small retail investors would see astronomical returns. 

The main argument against Starlink, in my opinion, is Musk’s prediction of an IPO several years in the future and his tweet cautioning investors about SPACs. ([https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1329483695493931009](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1329483695493931009)) My counterargument: He says a lot of shit on Twitter. Although Starlink does not fit every acquisition criteria, we know Ackman was in talks with AirBnB at one point and they are missing some of the acquisition criteria as well. I don't think that Starlink is the most likely candidate for PSTH but I no longer think that it is entirely impossible. This is purely speculation and I'm sure there are things I've missed. If there's something I'm misunderstanding feel free to correct me.

TL;DR  PSTH = Stripe_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ GME in a nutshell from 2020 to 2022 _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Something to feed your confirmation bias on Nio Nio's expansion to Europe has been discussed a lot. Many expressed doubts that Europeans would buy a Chinese car given all the negative stereotypes. From 2021, Germany introduced a CO2 tax (7c per liter) and till 2025 they give 9000 Euros for purchasing a EV. My main problem with German EVs is that they have an abysmal range. VW promises something up to 220km. I drove BMW i3 and whatever they promise there, the truth is that it's around 170 km and the charging takes like 9 hours. Why the hell do I need a car with such a range? 

Nio offers a range up to 900 km. Wow. That's something to consider. But what about the Chinese quality and as a potential German customer who got screwed over by the government's CO2 tax right on the New Year's day I decided to google what German reviews say on Nio:

ADAC praises Nio quality and price, specifying that 70% of materials are from renowned producers like Bosch

https://www.adac.de/rund-ums-fahrzeug/autokatalog/marken-modelle/auto/nio-es6/

Another very positive review stating that it has some problems with being adjusted to the European standards and market but in general it's a good car for German roads and is much cheaper than a comparable Audi

https://www.auto-motor-und-sport.de/fahrbericht/nio-es6-guenstiger-elektro-suv/

Another generally positive review. They point out that the battery is not suitable for a speed of over 120km/h which is a big problem for Germany's autobahn as 120 km/h is the annoying grandma speed here. However, other European countries have a speed limit so it might be less of a problem

https://www.autobild.de/artikel/nio-es6-performance-2022-test-preis-deutschland-reichweite-technische-daten-elekrtro-suv-17098037.html

Tl;dr German reviewers praise Nio for its price, quality and driving experience. The main disadvantage is that it is not fulfilling for some Europe-specific demands. However, if Nio adapts to those requirements, it will be a recommendable car.

Is it a sign? _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ I think WSB is sleeping on a huge opportunity in Apple this month. Here’s why. **TLDR:** Due to a confluence of factors (none of which are technical analysis), I believe a perfect storm is likely forming for a monster, historic ER occurring sometime in late January. The initial main factor for this was that COVID issues were causing a delay in the iPhone 12 launch, pushing it into to this quarter, but that led me to discover numerous other factors now making up my thesis. I believe not only will earnings grow, but the multiple could even expand. How to play it: calls dated end of Jan or mid Feb.    
    
# Analysis:    
Happy hangover day, fellow autists. I believe opportunities are rare to know when an ER is going to blow it out of the water by enough to overcome IV crush based on more than just a hunch, and when they occur once or twice per year you should swing big. When I play earnings releases, I’m almost always just a seller of spreads so that I can profit off of theta/IV crush surrounding the ER (theta gang always wins). This time however, I’ve bought outright calls. Here is what I’m seeing with Apple: 
    
## The iPhone 12 delay could mean huge YoY comparisons.    
What kicked all this off was that two months ago I realized we could be heading for huge numbers this quarter due to an atypical delay in the launch of the newest iPhone. Typically new iPhones are announced in mid-September with preorders beginning immediately and shipments beginning before the end of the month. However this year because of COIVD delays the launch date got pushed into October. The iPhone 12 preorders began mid-October with shipments a week later, and the iPhone 12 mini and Max began preorders November 6. And that means no sales of the new models counted in the quarter ended Sept. 30 (Apple’s fiscal fourth quarter)as they usually do. This year all of those opening day sales have fallen into the upcoming fiscal Q1, setting up a potentially huge quarter in sales and making for easy YoY comparisons right out of the gate.  [Here’s a Fortune article on the delay of the launch.](https://fortune.com/2020/10/29/apple-q4-2020-earnings-delayed-iphone-12-sales/)    
    
## The “super cycle” rumors appear to be true.    
As a lover of new tech, I always have to remind myself that the average person doesn’t care about incremental new features as much as I do. So when I heard rumors earlier this year that Apple could be facing a “super cycle” of upgrades due to 5G, I was skeptical. How much does the average person really care about spotty 5G service enough to jump on a new iPhone? But based on reports starting to come out, those rumors appear to be correct. I’ve seen a few articles suggesting a super cycle not seen since the iPhone 6.     
    
[Here’s a Yahoo Finance article on Wedbush’s analysis](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wedbush-apple-aapl-iphone-12-141113883.html?guccounter=1&amp;amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAACvsQ8XuWl-EktMyc_0BOQkervx-N2812THmBzr26X8EZIBpNv2lmQ5FSlcToQD1EVRPC0q6byIRBL57FjX5kL4yCvJbv0rwaj4D16cz9J0QrnLFX9fVib7fRoDktDyMAWwBKhfTL_JRqy04wsJCzfTUD7Aw9ce6SkM21ZQOqbYO).   
    
Here are some notable quotes from that article since I know we don’t read around here.    
>"Based on our recent Asia checks we believe the supply chain is anticipating low to mid 90 million iPhone unit builds … **a roughly 35% increase from our original and Street forecasts**," says Ives, who covers AAPL stock for Wedbush.    
    
>Compare that to the firm's expectations for iPhone 12 unit sales over time. Three months ago, Wedbush expected 65 million to 70 million unit builds for the December quarter; it raised its outlook to 75 million units in late October; and in mid-December, it set a "stretch goal" in the mid-80 million range.    
    
>Wall Street broadly sees AAPL selling 217 million iPhones in the company's fiscal 2021, but Wedbush's bull case is "north of 240 million units (250 million could be in the cards – an eye popping figure)" that would easily surpass the 231 million units the company sold in its fiscal 2015.    
    
>**"We have not seen a launch uptrend such as this in a number of years for Apple and the only iPhone trajectory similar would be the iPhone 6 in 2014 based on our analysis."**.   
    
[Here is an AppleInsider article, although it quotes the same research at Wedbush](https://appleinsider.com/articles/20/12/15/apple-iphone-production-reports-corroborate-supercycle-thesis-analyst-says).   
Notable quote:    
> That bump in production would represent a 30% year-over-year increase in smartphone models produced, **and is also well ahead of current Wall Street expectations**, Ives wrote.    
    
    
It’s anecdotal, but I personally skipped the iPhone 11 upgrade because I was perfectly content with my XS Max, however I did buy the 12 Pro Max.    
    
## The iPhone 12 sales mix:   
It’s not just that phone sales will be up on the iphone 12 launch, it’s the mix within those sales. Typically when Apple launches phones they sell more of the of the entry level new phones than they do the premium, because the total addressable market is bigger. That doesn’t appear to be the case this time. As early as September people were reporting that [Apple was making more higher end iPhone 12 models than entry-level handsets](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/click/apple-stock-gets-price-target-hike-iphone-12-sales-mix) anticipating a shift in demand, and they appear to have been correct. Last year the entry level iPhone 11s outsold the premium iPhone 11s by a three to one margin. This year almost immediately after launch [people were reporting that the premium iPhone 12s were selling as much as the entry models.](https://investorplace.com/2020/10/greater-than-expected-iphone-12-demand-apple-aapl-stock-buy/) Since then, there have been reports trickling out that the premium iPhone 12s appear to actually be outselling the entry level versions.   
    
## Apple sold out of nearly everything they make for Christmas.
See further below for one of the reasons this may have happened, in both my “macro” and “risks” sections.    
    
    

Apple introduced a slough of new products from iMacs to watches this year, and they sold out of all of them. **The list of sold-out products at Christmas included the iPhone 12 Pro and Pro Max; iPad, iPad Pro, iPad Air, and iPad Mini; MacBook Air and Pro; iMac and iMac Pro; HomePod mini, and AirPods Max.** [Here’s a Barron’s article mentioning the sell outs](https://www.barrons.com/articles/barrons-10-best-stocks-for-2021-51608337138).    

    
    
Apple wearables, I would argue, are now what economists call Veblen goods. These are unique products where the demand curve actually increases as the price increases. This can happen in goods such as wine, where the consumer lacks the knowledge in how to evaluate the product so they take pricing as a signal of quality. But another reason you can get that skewed demand curve is if the product conveys status. One example of this is sports cars. You can buy cars with 90% of the performance of the ultra top end cars for 30% of the price, but that’s not the point of owning them, is it? How often are you really out at the track? Lambo isn’t in competition with $50k sports cars. They could raise the price $50k per car and people who can afford them would just want them more. Louis Vuitton bags and $50,000 Birkin purses are more examples. In fact with Birkin they not only constantly raise prices, they forbid people from buying them. You have to spend a lot of money on other lower tier products before you’re “allowed” to even buy a Birkin bag. This just makes new money women want them even more. 
   

Those are dramatic examples of course and Apple isn’t behaving that way, but Apple just introduced very overpriced, new over-the-ear headphones which cost almost twice as much as the leading competitor, and yet...Apple sold out of every single color in the first two weeks and hit a three month waiting list by Christmas on a product that I would assume due to its high pricing has very fat margins. Apple charging twice as much makes them more appealing, not less, because wearables are worn and thus seen by your peers (and the opposite sex).   
    
## The Twitter rumor mill is reporting parts moving at a brisk pace
I can’t track down the things I’ve read here and there on Twitter and I’m starting to run out of steam here, so you may have to do some searching on your own, but people who usually track movement of parts through the companies forming Apple’s supply chain and normally have a good track record with their reports have reported that parts are moving through the chain at a very brisk pace. This is addressed some in the reports on the iPhone supply chain in my earlier links.    
    
## App sales are crushing it.   
Thanks probably in part to quarantine, app sales have been crushing it and [grew ~35% this December compared to ~17%](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/apple-alphabet-strong-christmas-sales) the prior year, meaning sales have grown at twice the pace.     

## Reoccurring revenue bundle numbers will be announced     
The biggest thing I’ve learned from 2020 is that nothing matters more to the market than the narrative surrounding the reoccurring revenue bundle...aka subscriptions. A company announces its cutting its dividend, but then tells you that’s because its going to pour all that money into boosting its subscriptions? The stock skyrockets. Look at Disney. ATT may be able to pull this off as well if it can convince people of that narrative with Warner/HBO max and cut its dividend to pour it into content, but that’s a big “if” for them.    
    
Apple launched their new reoccurring revenue bundle this year. I personally signed up for the premium tier and now owe Apple $30 per month for the rest of my life. I was already paying them to backup my phone to the cloud, and now their bundle has thrown me into Apple Music, Apple TV+, etc. I am firmly entrenched in the Apple universe whether I like it or not.     
    
It is these reoccurring revenue numbers that offer the possibility of earnings multiple expansion.
    
# RISKS
**Are sellouts due to high demand, or due to COVID-related production problems?**    
I don’t know.  Based on the reports I’ve read, some of which have been linked earlier in my post, it sounds like everything is running full speed in China and the supply chain is running at near or above a record clip. One possible risk is that this was not the case earlier this year and thus Apple sold out of things because they hadn’t produced enough heading into Christmas. I personally believe that production may have taken a huge hit early in the calendar year, but by mid to late 2020 this was no longer a significant issue. I also believe that even if sales have taken a slight hit due to production, the market wouldn’t really care. Markets are forward looking. They know COVID has impacted things globally, and even if Apple reports sales difficulties **they will be paired with significantly increased guidance for Q2**. [New reports have suggested that Apple has had to increase its iPhone production plans for 2021 by 20-30% because of strong demand](https://9to5mac.com/2020/12/15/strong-iphone-12-demand/) An announcement like that is not a recipe for a stock crash.     
    
    

**Macro factors causing a crash**.    
A lot of people around here appear to be scared of an impending crash. This seems to be based on the simple idea that stocks have run up a lot and therefore must crash. A reversion to the mean is imminent. I don’t see it that way and I think the economy is more complex than that. Just because something has gone up a lot does not mean it’s going to crash. People have been warning of a California real estate crash for 70 years.    
    

I’m a little bit older than you guys (by probably about 10-15 years) and I can remember the market frenzy of the dot.com boom. A lot of people were saying the same thing then, and while they were ultimately proven right, they were very early. I remember seeing another year to year and a half of enormous gains after hearing all those warnings. Of course the problem with musical chairs is that we never know when the music will stop, but I would argue if anything stocks are roughly fairly valued, not dangerously overvalued.    
    
As we go into 2021, we face the following conditions: a vaccine roll out that sometime between now and late ‘21 will lead us into a v-shaped recovery. [The Krugman argument for this vision](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/19/opinion/joe-biden-economy.html), and [The Bloomberg argument for this vision](https://www.bloomberg.com/amp/opinion/articles/2020-12-01/get-ready-for-a-supercharged-economy). We also just had the Fed reaffirm 0% interest rates and the continuation of QE. Add to all of that very easy YoY earnings comps for the first two quarters of this year and this is not a recipe for a crash, it’s a recipe for a steady market melt up. Where are the rich supposed to put all their money in a 0% interest rate environment? 0% pushes up the value of all asset classes, and this is especially true of real estate and stonks. Generally speaking, predicting macro economic movements is a losing game, but all of those things combined with the easy YoY comps means I don’t feel the need to be concerned of an impending correction for at least the next two quarters. 
    
A much smaller factor but still a factor, I have seen it suggested that Apple will be among the larger beneficiaries of the stimulus checks going out, although those have not started rolling out until just now so that may have an impact on Q2 if any.

**Bad subscription numbers**    

If subscriptions to Apple One flopped, this could significantly overshadow sales and earnings numbers. I personally feel Apple isn’t likely to seriously miscalculate predictions on a subscription bundle because they have their market dialed in, but I don’t know that for sure. 

**Sales could have cratered in October**    

Sales often drop a little in the weeks preceding a phone launch. What if phone sales tanked during the delays waiting for an iPhone 12? That could be bad. I’m encouraged by the fact that iPhone 11 models appeared to still be having good sales numbers when the iPhone 12 was launched (see links earlier in this post), but I don’t really know what October sales look like.

**COVID could have tanked all phone sales.**    

[This report says all phone activations generally tanked 23% on Christmas Day.](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/apple-iphones-dominate-christmas-day-activations) Two thoughts I have on that, that number is for all phone activations, not just iPhones. And two, that’s just for Christmas Day itself. There could be a wide array of reasons activations were down on that one day. To counter that, [this report says the iPhone was the best selling 5G phone](https://9to5mac.com/2020/12/21/best-selling-5g-phone/), even in October despite the phone not launching until the second half of that month. Additionally that article mentions pent up demand for 5G apple phones that sales are likely to be strong going forward.

##  Technical Analysis   
I don’t believe in technical analysis. Charts don’t know any of the things I just explained, and are therefore, in my opinion, useless to me. Maybe somebody has figured out a system for charts to predict the future, but I am not that person.      
     
## Price Target    
I don’t pretend to know things like that.     
    


## Fun rumors    
I’m not big on speculative rumors and momentum type plays, but if that’s your thing there are certainly rumors in the air. The most famous of which is the rumor that Apple is back to working seriously on an EV Car. Another is reports are just coming out in the last day or two that [Apple is seeing new successes in developing foldable tech.](https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/31/two-foldable-iphones-reportedly-pass-tests/) Whether these things will impact the stock price isn’t really my cup of tea, but if it’s yours those are two things to consider. 

## Is my post an attempt at a WSB pump and dump?    
I’m under no allusions that my own WSB post is going to alter the trajectory of a $2.25 trillion company in any meaningful way.  That sort of thing may work on a post-IPO company that hasn’t had its lockup expiration yet and thus has a tiny float (aka PLTR or numerous other recent “to the moon” meme stocks) with limited float. (That’s not to say those aren’t great companies or great trades. I’m just sayin’).


## My positions: 
I’m more conservative than most of WSB.  While I love this place with all my heart and love you guys for it, I believe risking it all to chase screenshot-worthy gains is moronic and not the path to building real, long-term wealth. Thus my positions are probably more conservative than you’d expect.    
    
I have 20% of my net worth tied up in Apple via LEAPs. 9/16/2022 AAPL $87.50 calls. I consider this to be essentially stock I hold for the long term. Delta is approaching 1 anyway so they practically are stock. Sometime in the depths of March I loaded up on FAANG LEAPs with the intention of actually holding them for years and then converting to shares. Those LEAPs were a little OTM at the time I bought them. I have no interest in day trading my significant LEAP positions so that’s going to sit there for the next two years.

But I also have put an additional 15% of my net worth into short term calls on Apple to play the ER. I have Feb 19 $130 calls which were about 10-15% OTM at the time I bought them. They are currently ITM. I also have 1/29 $135s and 1/29 $141s.     
    
This puts 35% of my net worth into Apple.

## How to get rich
I intend to cash out my short term calls after the ER, and I don’t intend to reinvest or roll them out because I suspect Apple will be fully valued by then and there are better plays out there. I intend to keep my LEAPS because I bought those for the very long term and because at the very least I should hold them until March to hit the long term capital gains tax rate.    
    
I intend to take my profits from the calls and push them into shorting NNOX and XPEV, both of which have significant lockup expirations coming in mid to late February which I believe will significantly impact the stock prices in the short term. I have no interest in shorting XPEV right now, because you guys are crazy as fuck and for all I know EV stonks could all run up another 50% in the next month. Right about the time the Apple ER hits should be perfect.

## Criticism    
If you think I’m wrong, I would strongly encourage you to comment. I don’t give a fuck about looking correct or saving face but I give many fucks about not losing money. If I’m wrong, I want to know it.

For those that have big brains and have been following along (here's the most recent one: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kh9na8/gme\_4q20\_financial\_model/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kh9na8/gme_4q20_financial_model/)), I have ticked almost every metric down, with the largest reduction being a 4k+ trim to daily order rate as January/post Christmas has started off rather weak. It's irrefutable that supply, whether through managerial operational failings, or lost market share, or outside their control due to Covid, is weighing on sales. Whenever there's been console supply especially the uptick in sales is notable and somewhat durable in the order rate data (many thanks once again GME Gang for the steady influx of [GameStop.com](https://GameStop.com) order #s!!! You retarded motherfuckers are going to singlehandedly pump the PowerUp Rewards loyalty numbers 😂  ([https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/km26gn/gamestop\_dd\_and\_potential\_profits/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/km26gn/gamestop_dd_and_potential_profits/))

With two full months of the quarter gone by I would note no one should have ever put their belief solely into one quarter making/breaking their thesis in isolation (unless you're talking about a biotech or some crazy shit. But this is a goddamn [GameStop.com](https://GameStop.com), FKA GameStop, we're talking about here.). The bears will vociferously argue otherwise. I look forward to hearing the gnashing of teeth of the dying animal that is Melvin Capital & co. Let's make 'em bleed, boys.

My base case sits at $2/share, and will likely come down a touch more barring incremental console supply in January (in base case).

\*\*\*I do want to clarify that some of the timing of iOS 14 changes could get changed and Facebook could push back against certain parts of the change. I did my best to explain the basics of what I think is going on, but it is possible that I miscommunicated or misunderstood some parts of the iOS 14 update, so digital marketers, feel free to let me know in the comments and I'll edit accordingly\*\*\*

\-------------------------------

# TL;DR - Apple's iOS 14 - "Get Zucked, Zuckerberg," Said Tim Cook

For reasons that will be explained below, it is possible that Google and Facebook will begin seeing their duopoly slowly diminish over the next several years (probably >7 years, based on how "fast" Turtle Mitch is able to get anything done). I do believe that Google and Facebook will continue to be the top two players in the game for the foreseeable future **(SO I AM NOT RECOMMENDING SHORTING THESE AT ALL YOU 🌈 NOOBS).**

The core problems that these companies will soon face, especially Facebook, is [anti-trust law suits from the FTC](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2020/12/ftc-sues-facebook-illegal-monopolization), more distrust of their platform due to the most recent election, censorship across both platforms, a complete failure of Facebook to properly address the negative side effects of social media on the youth and actually do something about it, and, most importantly, **Apple upgrading to iOS 14 (explained more later).**

* [The Anti-Trust Law Suit from the FTC](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2020/12/ftc-sues-facebook-illegal-monopolization) talks about Facebook becoming a monopoly and buying all the competition such as Instagram and WhatsApp, instead of competing against them.
* [iOS 14](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kateoflahertyuk/2020/08/30/ios-14-facebooks-apple-nightmare-keeps-getting-worse/?sh=3029be574cfe) update will roll out early 2021. This will hinder the collection of iPhone identifiers for advertisers ([IDFA](https://www.appsflyer.com/mobile-attribution-glossary/idfa/)), one of the primary things used to track users online.

\-------------------------------

Primary Issues For Facebook From The iOS 14 Update

1. **Bidding Issues:** As I stated above, Facebook is going to lose more and more data points as  time goes on, making it so that they aren't able to bid appropriately on someone like Johnny Bravo when he is scrolling through his insta feed. What does this mean? Insta may look at Johnny Bravo as a Joe Schmo and decide that he's not worth bidding up on, so Johnny Bravo will never see those ads of Playboy and Whey Protein that he would have bought if he got an ad for it. (Example for this: with the iOS14 update, Facebook loses its data points to Johnny Bravo's workout apps, so they had no way of knowing he would have been more likely to convert.
2. **Creating Audiences:** Facebook is going to lose thousands of data points on its users, effectively making it harder to match these audiences into their appropriate buckets. Before, if someone had several golf apps on their phone, you could assume they were a golf lover more easily. Without being able to use that app data sharing, it will be much harder to know they like golf unless they follow several golfing pros / shows in Facebook.

\-------------------------------

With the expectation that Facebook will become less efficient as time goes on and that certain lawsuits could negatively affect the company, many advertisers are looking for other viable options to put their ad dollars. There have been several social media competitors working to monetize their app and become the third wheel of digital marketing. Some of these companies include:

* PINS - Pinterest 🚀🚀🚀
* SNAP - Snapchat 🚀
* TWTR - Twitter 🚀
* Twitch - (Owned by Amazon aka AMZN) 🚀🚀
* LNKD - LinkedIn (Owned by Microsoft aka MSFT) 🚀
* Hulu Ads - (Owned by Disney aka DIS) 🚀🚀
* TikTok - Not sure if correct, but you may be able to get shares [here](https://www.ig.com/en/shares/ipos/bytedance-tiktok-ipo) (ticker tbd, but pretty sure it will be ZOOMR 🚀

The name of the game is trying figuring out which of these new channels will be the next to gain 5-10% more market share of ad spend from clients and which will be nothing more than moneyless pits since they do a terrible job at monetizing their app and creating engaging ads that lead to conversions for clients (looking at you SNAP and TikTok).

\-------------------------------

MY RECENT BACKGROUND (aka why should you even bother listening to this autist):

* **Worked in digital marketing and finance for the last 5 years**, also took on several side jobs doing digital marketing for companies
   * **I managed >$10 million in ad spend across various digital marketing channels (Google/Bing/Facebook/Shopping) over the last 30 days** and over >$40 million in ad spend over the last year
   * I work with a team of Managers and Directors at my agency to help talk about new opportunities and keep up with digital marketing trends across all channels
   * Using our >300 clients data, our company is able to look at macro trends at a faster rate, so we can quickly identify which new channels to focus our efforts in (Pinterest/TikTok/Snap/Twitch/etc.)
      * This was highlighted over the last year or year and a half when we noticed a huge spike in companies using Pinterest as a primary channel for digital marketing. Only more and more companies are going to join into the race, this is just the beginning.

\-------------------------------

# Any of these stocks or multiple could improve throughout the following years, but my money is on PINS 🚀🚀🚀

* Even with PINS recent run up in stock price, I think there is still plenty of time to buy this stock now.
   * Our clients are continuing to spend more and more on the Pinterest ad platform and it is returning better performance metrics (ROAS/ROI) than most of the other mentioned channels.
* Pinterest also relies on on targeting people based on boards they visit/follow/create, combined with using a search query method for ads, somewhat similar to Google's. **This means they don't have to rely as much on pixel data, like Facebook does, to create their audience targeting.**

&#x200B;

# I think the safest way to make money on PINS is to buy stocks for the long term, but I know that doesn't get some of your little schlongs hard enough.

* Their next earnings are on 2/4/21(after hours) and ***I fully expect them to smash expectations just like McConnell's dad smashed that turtle to give birth to Mitch.***
   * Look at PINS options that make sense to you for a little after earnings, preferably not 2/5, literally the day after earnings. But you do you boo.

Kitties N Titties_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Potential in coming real estate dip in 2021. Are there any non-idiots among us that work in this space and want to share their thoughts? TLDR: I have no fucking clue what I am talking about. It looks like the housing market is ready to decline in late 2021, maybe as soon as the spring. I am considering selling my rental house soon... obviously so I can yolo more into GME, PLTR, and SPCE - I can't help myself and I don't want help. If this happens, REITs might dip further, making for a nice entry point.

&#x200B;

Home prices have been steadily rising the last five or so years to the point  we are seeing a spike in the inflation adjusted housing costs. It looks  like we are at the 07/08 highs again.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/r6on75066t861.png?width=739&format=png&auto=webp&s=9bac32713ff598bab5431b52ae7d8e45332340ba

I have been following the forbearance rates since covid started, and it looks like many of the national lenders have forbearance rates in the 3-6% range, still.  Historically these are under 1% for all lenders. If these eventually  turn into delinquencies after the forbearance period expires and covid  eviction protections expire, I am worried we might see a surge in  foreclosures and thus a flood of cheap real estate hitting the market, thus drastically reducing home prices in the second half of 2021.

I'll  walk you through the timing I am seeing. 

* The majority of forbearance  requests were made in March - June (the MBA has been publishing this  data). 
* These periods usually last 180 days,  based on historical forbearance periods. 
* And I believe these periods can  be extended for up to one year, which is also part of covid relief.
* The  national average number of delinquent payments on a mortgage before  foreclosure is about four.
* For those with 180 day forbearance periods started in March- June of 2020, it looks like this: 6 months forbearance + 4 months delinquency = 10 months, which puts these foreclosures on the market in February 2021-May 2021.
* For those with 365 day forbearance periods started in March- June of 2020, it looks like this: 12 months forbearance + 4 months delinquency = 16 months, which puts these foreclosures on the market in July 2021- October 2021.
* Finally, for those who were delinquent prior to covid, and would have been evicted during covid, the eviction protection has prevented banks from foreclosing, so these homes will hit the market in February 2021, after the eviction protections expire on January 31st 2021. Foreclosures are down 80% this year because of this.

&#x200B;

If  we check FRED and look at delinquent payment on real estate over the  last 20 years, we can see about 10% of homes and real estate were in delinquency by 2010 (below). If all the current forbearances turn into  delinquent payments, which turn into foreclosures, we could see a 2-6%  spike by the end of the summer, or a 2-6x increase in foreclosure  based real estate hitting the market. Plus we need to add in the 80% of foreclosures that will hit post eviction moratorium. That would be about 2/3s the delinquency rate we saw post financial crisis, which would could cause quite a dip in home prices.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/5rr035o96t861.png?width=1173&format=png&auto=webp&s=6755ae28f0d241fba65b886498bf1372869637ff

The current market is also further magnified buy the shortage of homes for sale, in part due to the lack of foreclosures due to the eviction moratorium. You can see below, the US is at an all time low for monthly supply  of houses, dating back to 1960.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4136uv3c6t861.png?width=1174&format=png&auto=webp&s=859c31a721b63b5c01f787d6cfec5ae387a8700e

When you combine a low supply with a relatively high demand (see housing  sales the last two years, below), this creates a pretty expensive market based  on supply and demand. Also, interest rates are low, so people can afford more, so housing prices are higher as a result.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/abfzz0he6t861.png?width=1179&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd698a8aefca84c6318c3c74da02ec2293b7aa19

In agreement with this, home prices are the highest in history as well  (below), even when adjusted for inflation (first figure of the post).

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

This could easily turn  into a serious situation in which a sudden spike in foreclosures and  cheap real estate could cascade into a pretty swift crash, and  significantly reduce the value of real estate around the country by a  huge margin.

Does  anyone here have any real expertise on this matter? I am a complete  newb and idiot. I don't know what I am doing, I am just speculating. I  would greatly appreciate an expert's opinion on the matter.
