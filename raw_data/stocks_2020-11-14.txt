Would you consider AAPL a good growth stock? What are your top 5 growth stocks? Small account, but have AAPL in it being the least I'm invested in. Currently in my mid 20s and looking for great growth stocks to inquire about. SQ and PINS are my biggest holdings with a little bit of CL (Cresco Labs) and then AAPL.

This list if unbelievable high yields goes on.._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $RKT new financial partner Last week's ER referenced a partnership with a financial services player, rumored to be $PRI.

Been thinking about the prospects if that rumor is true.  

For those who don't know, $PRI is Primerica, the direct-sales aka MLM life insurance company.  

On the one hand, $PRI gets mercilessly slagged basically everywhere.  If you look under the hood, the criticism is overblown, but regardless, the perception exists.  There's a chance that Rocket being pitched by Primerica could impact the image.  

It's also a bit strange to have basically the industry's best originator (Rocket) using another originator (Primerica)


But when you ponder it, there's some brilliance to such a deal for both sides.  

For Primerica, their schtick is saving people money on their monthly bills, and then redirecting that money into purchase of Primerica insurance and investment products.  To my knowledge, Primerica doesn't and can't do anything with people's loans and mortgages, so teaming up with Rocket, they could make savings projections based on people refinancing with Rocket, then use those assumed savings to juice their own products that they do sell. 

For Rocket, it would mean 100,000 incentivized reps running around pushing clients to refinance with Rocket.  That would be cheap origination for Rocket, but more importantly, it would be a continuous and ongoing flow of business that would reduce the seasonality and perceived cyclical nature that they're perceived to have._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Calculating total return WITH additional allocations Hi there, wondering how to calculate return YTD when I've added money at three points during the year.

Thanks!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Costco selling $17.5K private jet membership that lasts 1 year If you’re worried about flying commercial because of the pandemic, Costco might be able to help you out -- you’ll just need $17,500.

The wholesale retailer sells a one-year membership to a private jet charter company called Wheels Up, which allows members to book a private jet “as easily as a ride share or short-term vacation rental,” the product description says.

Although the $17,499.99 membership is quite a hefty fee, it also comes with a $3,500 Costco Shop Card and $4,000 worth of flight credit.

Other benefits include “dedicated account management,” a one-year membership with Inspirato, a luxury vacation rental subscription service and “guaranteed nationwide aircraft availability up to 365 days a year,” according to the description.

Members can either buy an additional “Fund Program” with lower rates and lower billable fly times, or they can “pay as they fly,” according to the product description.

The Wheels Up fleet includes more than 300 private aircraft as well as more than 1,250 partner aircraft.

The company also promises enhanced health and safety measures through its “Safe Passage” program, which includes having all Wheels Up aircraft getting an anti-microbial shield treatment at least every 90 days and having all seats and interior surfaces sanitized between every flight, the website says.

The Wheels Up membership can be found online in the “Electronics” category, or in-store with other gift cards, according to The Washington Post.

So, I’m quite new to investing, but I think that I have a pretty solid-ish level of knowledge in this already. I’m probably going to delete this, since this is pretty dumb, but let’s get in to it...

Alright. My latest post discussed about what are people’s reasons why they are invested in the big-shot stocks like Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Google etc. OR should I say those people who are in it for the long run, why do you think they’ll grow even more? 

I know, that many people didn’t comment on it, but I was still somewhat surprised that people weren’t THAT Apple friendly. Sure, people weren’t disliking Apple, but they weren’t that optimistic about it, which made me a bit uncertain about it. Don’t get me wrong I think Microsoft & the others (Amazon and Google) might have a bit more potential/room to grow than Apple, but they (Apple) aren’t gonna dissappear, are they? 

But I get it, the biggest companies change all the time etc, etc. But Apple is still like a good investment right? Have I just overreacted or some sort? My original plans where that $MSFT and $AAPL would hold a decent amount in my portfolio. That’s still a good strategy, IF I diversify in other areas and I’m not going to change these plans based on other people’s opinions, BUT I shouldn’t get too sentimental about it, which I mean by you should NEVER get attached to any stocks. If Apple starts to go south as a company then of course I’ll get rid.

My point is: Apple is a good investment, which you can trust in, isn’t it?

Most of these are long term ETFs like QQQ and its little brother QQQJ. I also hold some bigger name companies like AAPL, MSFT, V, BAC, and of course my weed stonk GRWG. 

It’s inevitable that we will have bloody days as well as days where green is the only thing we can see for miles. Is it worth it to have a separate account for saving up to have some extra powder to put back in the market for those bloody days? Or should I still be adding on to my position on a week to week basis?

# **Tug of war between value and growth stocks may drive the market again in the week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/13/tug-of-war-between-value-and-growth-stocks-may-drive-the-market-again-in-the-week-ahead.html)**
*****
> The stock market is caught between the rapidly spreading virus and the promise of a vaccine.
*****
> That is likely to drive trading in the week ahead, as it did in the past week. Investors have been weighing cyclical plays that will do better when the economy reopens fully, against the big tech and growth names that weathered the virus shutdowns in the spring and benefit from the stay-at-home trend.
*****
> In the past week, that trade resulted in a mixed performance with the Dow up 4% but the Nasdaq down about 0.5%, as investors sold off technology and communications services stocks. The S&P 500 finished up 2.2% at a record close of 3,585, its first since Sept. 2. The renewed spread of the virus by mid-week had tamped down the exuberance over news from Pfizer Monday that its vaccine has proven highly effective and could be broadly distributed next year.
*****
> The election is still uncertain though the market has responded well to the idea that a Democratic president and a mixed Congress will likely result in gridlock. President Donald Trump refuses to concede while his campaign challenges election results. Former Vice President Joe Biden was declared the presumptive president-elect last Saturday and has been moving to organize a cabinet.
*****
> # Next hurdle for market
> “We largely put the election in the rear view mirror. The next hurdle for this market to contend with will be the path of the virus, and that will be the chief focus. It means a less strident rotation,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities. “Growth has actually outperformed value for the last 17 years. That’s a lot of inertia to break...If this is a pivot point, it’s a long-term pivot point.”
*****
> The surging virus is raising renewed concerns about the economy as some cities are likely to put new limits on activities to slow the spread. In the U.S. there were a record 153,400 new cases Thursday.
*****
> Besides the virus headlines, investors will be watching economic data, particularly retail sales Tuesday and existing home sales Thursday. There are a flurry of Fed speakers, including Fed Vice Chairman Richard Clarida Monday.
*****
> Retailers report earnings in the week ahead with reports from Walmart and Home Depot Tuesday and Target Wednesday. NVIDIA also reports on Wednesday.
*****
> The Pfizer news and the election outcome combined to unleash a new wave of bullishness early in the past week. Goldman Sachs, for instance, put a target of 4,200 on the S&P 500 for 2021, and JPMorgan said the benchmark could rise to as high as 4,500 next year.
*****
> # Value vs growth
> Hogan said the value play trend had actually been underway before the Pfizer news and is what helped take the Russell 2000 to close at a new high for the first time Friday since August, 2018.
*****
> Small caps in the Russell 2000 have been outperforming for the past three months. Since Oct. 1, the Russell is up 15.5%, compared to just under 6.6% gain for the S&P 500. In the past week, the Russell was the best performer, up 6% for the week on Friday, compared to the 2.2% gain in the S&P 500.
*****
> In the past week, energy stocks surged 16.5%,and airlines were up 10.5%, The S&P financial sector was up 8.2%, with commercial banks gaining 11.2%. At the same time, information technology declined 0.4% and consumer discretionary stocks were down 1.1%. Communications services was among the weak performers, up just 0.8%
*****
> “I think it’s just a constant tug of war...based on what we see with the virus headlines and such. I think that’s driving a lot,” said Paul Hickey, co-founder of Bespoke Investment Group. “When you get the bad headlines, you start seeing the growth stocks do well. When you get the good headlines, you start seeing the value stocks doing better.”
*****
> Hickey expects to continue seeing vaccine developments from other manufacturers. “Some of these high-flying Covid stocks are going to get hit as the headlines get better. We’ve been rotating out of the large cap tech stocks, but we don’t think they’re necessarily going to go down, so to speak,” he said. “We just think there’s better opportunity in some of the more cyclical parts of the market. It’s more a function of underperformance than decline.”

> # A Very Good Ten

> With nearly ten trading days under its belt for November, the S&P 500 is putting together quite a month. Through early morning Friday, the S&P 500 was up just over 9% which ranks as the best first ten trading days for a month since January 1987. In the entire history of the S&P, there have only been 17 other months where the S&P 500 was up over 9% in the first ten trading days of the month, and in the post-WWII period, there have only been five.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/111320-First-Ten-Days-Copy.png))**

> So, when a month starts off strong, does it usually finish that way? Or is there some sort of reversion to the mean? Unfortunately, prior experience isn't particularly consistent in one direction of the other. The table below shows each month since 1928 where the S&P 500 was up at least 7.5% in the first ten trading days of a month. Overall, the S&P 500's average rest of month performance has been a gain of 0.96%. That sounds good, but on a median basis, the rest of the month typically sees a decline of 0.2% with positive returns less than half of the time.

> In looking at the chart above and the table below, you'll notice that most of the strong starts for the S&P came during the Depression in the pre-WWII period. In 1932 and 1933, for example, there were five occurrences each year! Looking at the post-WWII period where the frequency of occurrences wasn't nearly as common, strong starts to a month typically saw a more positive but still not a very consistent trend. In the ten prior months since the end of WWII, the S&P 500's average rest of month performance was a gain of 1.27% (median: 1.69%) with gains 60% of the time.

> # November Expiration Week: S&P 500 & DJIA Stronger

> DJIA has been up 11 of the last 16 years on Monday of expiration week and Friday is up 14 of the last 18 years with an average gain of 0.56%. By the way, it is not a mistake that November Op-Ex day has the same point change and percent change in 2014 and 2015. It was triple checked and its correct. If you go out 2 more decimal places in the percentage calculation, it’s different.

> S&P 500, NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have not been as bullish as DJIA around or on November option expiration. S&P 500 has advanced only 17 times during options expiration week while NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have climbed only 16 and 14 times respectively over the past 26 years. All four indices have posted average losses on Monday and aside from DJIA and S&P 500 have been essentially mixed on options expiration day. Friday’s solid average gains across the board are largely due to a sizable gain in 2008. Any weakness next week could be a good entry point for new longs ahead of the historically bullish Thanksgiving holiday.

> # Week before Thanksgiving DJIA Up 19 of 27, But…

> DJIA has a solid track record over the last 27 years, rising 19 times the week before Thanksgiving with a median gain of 0.46%. But the other major U.S. stock market benchmarks are not as strong and there has been more weakness across the board recently. Since 2003 DJIA is up only 9 out of the last 17 years with a median gain of 0.10%.

> S&P is up 16 of the last 27 years with a median gain of 0.35% and down 9 of the last 17, –0.13% median loss. NASDAQ is up 15 of the last 27 years with a median gain of 0.33% and down 9 of the last 17, –0.004% median loss. Russell 200 is up 14 of the last 27 years with a median gain of 0.36% and down 10 of the last 17, –0.27% median loss.

> This sets up well for the Thanksgiving trade of buying into weakness the week before Thanksgiving and selling into strength around the holiday and typical November end-of-month strength.

> # New High in New 52 Week Highs

> As equities and other risk assets surge, a massive number of S&P 500 stocks are hitting new 52 week highs today. As shown in the chart below, as of midday 27.92% of S&P 500 stocks have reached new 52 week highs today and just one stock, Biogen (BIIB), is reaching a new 52 week low. The net reading of 27.72% is the highest reading for net new highs since January of 2018. Prior to that, you would need to go all the way back to May 22nd of 2013 to find the last time there was such a high reading.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/110920-Net-New-Highs-2.png))**

> Looking at the best-performing stocks in the index today, the list is mostly comprised of the stocks that have been extremely beaten down in the COVID economy like energy, travel, and retail/retail real estate names. Despite this, some still find themselves as some of those furthest below their 52-week highs. Take for example Carnival Cruiselines (CCL). The stock is seeing a phenomenal 35% gain just in today's session, but even at today's highs it was still well over 60% below its high for the year. It is a similar story for CCL's peer, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings (NCLH) which is up 27.78% but was 61.4% from its highs at its best price today. On the other hand, there are 28 stocks that have come within 1% of their 52-week highs at their high prices today. Another 80 stocks have come within 5% of their 52-week highs at their intraday highs today.

> # Big Milestone For Small Stocks

> No US equity index has reacted more strongly since Election Day than the Russell 2000 small-cap index. As shown in the chart below, the index finally broke out above its highs from earlier in the year following Monday's positive vaccine news. After that move on Monday, the Russell 2000 was up over 10% in just the last six trading days.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/1110-RTY.png))**

> In just about any other year besides 2020, a 10%+ move in the Russell 2000 would be an extraordinary move, but this year the most recent move is actually the sixth one of at least that much. In fact, coming out of the March lows, the Russell saw three six-day moves of 19.1%, 16.3%, and 14.8%, respectively. The frequency with which we've seen these 10%+ moves in the Russell 2000 over a six-day period has been unlike any other year in the Russell's history. Behind 2020, the year with the next highest total of 10%+ moves was 2011 (4) and then 2008 (3), and the most there has been in any twelve-month rolling basis is five spanning late 2008 through the first half of 2009.

> # 3 Election Charts That Caught Our Attention

> Stocks just had their best week since April, with the S&P 500 Index incredibly a chip shot away from new all-time highs. Joe Biden will be the next President of the United States, but markets are confident Republicans will maintain the Senate, and this means gridlock in Washington. Remember, gridlock is good, as it pulls policy towards compromise and avoids extremes. Also, any legislative changes to taxes, regulation, and capital gains will have meaningful input from both parties.

> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, a split Congress tends to mean stronger stock returns, almost ignoring whether a Democrat or Republican is in the White House. The most likely outcome from the election at this point is a Democratic president with a divided Congress—a scenario that historically has produced solid S&P 500 returns of 15.9% a year.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/11.9.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

> Assuming President-elect Joe Biden takes over in January 2021, it is important to note that historically stocks haven’t done as well the first and second years of a new president compared with an incumbent winning. This makes sense though, as historically voters may have chosen new leadership in part because of economic weakness, and the uncertainty of a new president’s policies could also hold things back some. If things are good, the president tends to win reelection. Things turn around significantly by the third year in office, though, if there’s new leadership. Of course, it’s worth noting that the first year of a new president has seen the S&P 500 higher recently, with stocks up nearly 20% the first year under President Donald Trump (2017) and 23% under President Barack Obama (2009).

> Lastly, the strength from stocks around the election has been rather historic. “The S&P 500 added 1% on four consecutive days, which hasn’t happened since late 1982,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Although there are only three other times this rare blast of strength happened since WWII, it is worth noting that strong returns going out a year took place after each instance.” The bottom line: Extreme buying pressure has a funny way of resolving higher, and we don’t anticipate this time being any different.

> # 3 The Biggest Winners Are Still Big Losers

> With household names like Carnival (CCL), Wynn Resorts (WYNN), Simon Property (SPG), and Royal Caribbean (RCL) all up over 20% today, more than a few people out there are probably kicking themselves for not owning any of them. But before you start ripping your hair out, keep in mind that just about all of these stocks are down (and in a big way) on the year. Of the 33 stocks in the S&P 500 that are up over 20% following today’s vaccine news, all but one of them are still down year to date. The only exception is Expedia (EXPE), which even after a 20%+ gain is still up just 18% on the year.

> In terms of sector representation, Energy tops the list with more than a third of the names (12) on the list. Behind Energy, Real Estate (8), Consumer Discretionary (6), and Financials (6) are the only other sectors with multiple stocks listed.

> Just as the best-performing stocks are all still underperforming the S&P 500 on a year to date basis, the biggest losers today are among the year’s biggest winners. There are 25 stocks in the S&P 500 that were down on the day as of the middle of the afternoon, but the only one that is down on the year is Biogen (BIIB), a stock whose decline has nothing to do with the vaccine news. Including BIIB, the 25 biggest losers are still up an average of 41% YTD (median: 31%). Behind BIIB, the two worst-performing stocks in the S&P 500 today are Pool (POOL) and Etsy (ETSY). Both stocks are down over 10% on the day, but for the year are still holding onto gains of 56.4% and 190.5%, respectively.

> # Policy Uncertainty Spiked Into the Election

> For the month of October, the NFIB's reading on small business sentiment was unchanged at the headline levels but many of the sub-indices broadly pointed to further improvements in business conditions. That is not to say small businesses do not have their share of concerns. As shown in the chart below, the NFIB's index on Economic Policy Uncertainty rose another 4 points in October to 98 which is the second-highest reading on record behind November of 2016; around the time of the last presidential election.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/111020-NFIB-Uncert2.png))**

> The election played a role in the uncertainty as 31% of small businesses surveyed reported government-related concerns as their biggest problem in October (lower chart). That was up for the second month in a row and is around the high end of the past couple of year's range. Additionally, as discussed earlier, labor also dominates the minds of small businesses as small businesses report struggles in filling roles. 30% reported cost or quality of labor as the single most important problem (top chart). That is unchanged since August.

It shows the typical one-year seasonal pattern of the ratio of the Russell 2000 to the Russell 1000 from July through June (scale on right). Overlaid on top of this pattern is the performance of this ratio in 2020 so far through today’s close (left scale). When the ratio is declining, large-cap stocks are outperforming small cap stocks. When the ratio is climbing, small caps are outperforming. In a typical year, small-caps will lag until around late-September or early October and then take off right around mid-December.

> Covid-19 related shutdowns and unemployment had kept small caps essentially sidelined this year. There were bouts of strength in late-July to mid-August and a brief surge in mid-September and again in early October. The recent surge higher could be an early start to the major move higher that typically begins around mid-December.

# DISCUSS!

What are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?

*****

I hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading week ahead r/stocks._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Can anyone explain SQQQ to me? Newbie here and I’m just trying to understand SQQQ.  From what I can tell, it is at the lowest point in years but been on a steady decline due to its counterpart rising.  I know that it is a way to short the market, but I’m not understanding how it can go much lower.  From what I’ve read, if you buy and hold, you can lose your ass due to leveraged-induced decay.  Can anyone explain it more thoroughly and why it’s a bad idea to buy?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ All ETF, or a variation Hi Reddit, 

So I'm quite new to the stock market, been trading for +/- 4 months now. Currently I'm looking into 3 kind of portfolios:
1: All EFT (+/- 2 big ones. Set and forget.)
2: mix in different ETF
   - emerging markets.
   - green energy
   - iShares global water 
   - van Eck gaming 
   - AEX
   - S&P 500
3: 1 global ETF and other stocks
  - vanguard global
       - Tesla
       - NIO
      - Microsoft
      - Facebook
      - alphabet 
       - Amazon
 And looking into a few others 
 

So what do you think, I have about 8K to invest right now. This beginner will appreciate all help._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Looking back at r/stocks predictions regarding Hyliion (HYLN) In light of the recent NIO posts, I though it would be interesting to look at the predictions regarding hyliion, another hyped up EV related stock. I'm not saying that NIO is like hyliion (I own some shares of NIO) but it's just interesting to see the discussion in hindsight. Hyliion ended up never gaining beyond $59 and is currently trading at $23

The [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/j03etb/hyliion_hyln_is_not_the_next_nikola_this_is_a/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) discussing Hyliion.

I'm not sharing this to throw anybody under the bus; everybody has made bad predictions. I'm just saying to stay diligent and not blindly follow the majority._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Mutual fund ideas Hey guys! In my tfsa with td I want to set up an automated buy for my slow growth stocks. That way I dont ever pay a quarterly enhancement fee nor a buy fee. I set up a bunch of etfs I wanted to invest in and to my demise the bank only does mutual funds as automated buys. I can still buy my etfs manually through it but I have to invest in mutual funds to do the automated deposit. Basically, what exactly are mutual funds? How do they compare to etfs? And quite frankly, what are some good ones to look into?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ The fear of averaging up Hello,

I'm somewhat new to actively investing in stocks. I've been participating in the ESPP of the company I work for for a few years, but I started investing in other stocks only recently.

I would describe myself as pretty risk tolerant. I have now invested the majority of my savings in individual stocks and plan on adding regularly in the future. My portfolio currently consists of 6 stocks. I want to keep it in the range of about 5 to 8 different stocks and not diversify much more beyond that.

What I am unsure about is how I should invest that part of my salary that I want to invest every month. 5 of the 6 stocks that I own have gone up (10 - 20%) since I bought them. I would like to buy more of these, but I just hate the idea of averaging up. Waiting for a dip sounds good in theory but what if that dip never comes. I own stocks like STNE, PLTR, KEYS and I'd be surprised if they went below the price I bought them anytime soon.

The one stock that has gone down is a company I'm less confident about than the others, so I don't feel comfortable buying more of that one right now (they also published a so-so earnings report last week).

The way I see it, I now have the choice to either buy new stocks and diversify or to average up. As I said, I'm more than happy to take some risks and therefore I don't want to diversify my portfolio too much.

Do I just have to get over my fear of averaging up since it's a normal part of investing? Should I hold on to my money I would like to invest and wait for a dip?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Anyone build models to value stocks regularly? I was just wondering if anyone actually builds a discounted cash flow model, and if not, why not? This seems to be the only logical way to value a company, and you can tweak it along the way as earnings and more information comes out. Would anyone be willing to share their model as well? Thank you._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Nvidia’s big change is about to flip back around https://www.marketwatch.com/story/nvidias-big-change-is-about-to-flip-back-around-11605298728

“We expect Nvidia to meet our data center segment estimates, while potentially posting solid gaming segment upside on the ramp of the GeForce RTX 3000-series product cycle,” Wells Fargo analyst Aaron Rakers said. He has an outperform rating and a $605 price target, with a cautious near-term stance on data-center sales.

Citi Research analyst Atif Malik, who has a buy rating and a $540 price target, said he expects a “modest upside” to the Street’s revenue consensus given suggestions that PC gaming revenue is up “midteens,” sales to Nintendo are “up sharply,” and in-line data-center growth.

“We see upside setup led by new GeForce 3000-series GPUs,” Schafer said. Data center “is expected to grow at a modest pace as hyperscalers digest capacity after a strong 1H spend cycle.”_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Broker that allows ypu to buy options contracts in the UK? Hey guys,

I live in the Uk and I'm currently using Trading212 to invest and use the CFD's to earn a bit more money. The only downside of t212 is that they charge you interest in open overnight positions in CFD's.

I've seen in r/wallstreetbets that these retards always play with options in robin - hood and some of them get rich and others lose money.

So I was wondering if there is any UK 🇬🇧 or EU 🇪🇺 broker that allows you to buy options contracts?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Many of us have a momentum fetish. It baffled me that all of you guys are fishing in the same pond of stock.  Everyone is upsetting with the hot stock of the moment . NIO, Tesla , any of those Ark , palentir . 

As little investors we can go fish in business smaller and with a LOT more potential for growth .

I mean Palentir is worth 16B if the growth 10x that 160B .

Get a 300M compagnie. It can go up 50x before being as big as palentir . 500x to 160B

Large investor, big money manger don’t go there . It’s  were we should be fishing . But no lets buy AAPL you know because the tree growth to the sky._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Why are the tobacco stocks so undervalued? As a noob I am looking at these stocks and they seem so attractive. They have a very low price to book, fat dividend yields that are growing, and are in a business that is arguably at first glance not going away any time soon ... Smoking tobacco will still be here in 20 years time, right? These look like cash cows to me honestly ... It's not like oil stocks where you could have doubts about the demand going down because of renewables or stuff ... And surely even if tobacco demand goes down in develeoped countries, it will stay high or even grow in emerging ones, right?  And you could also argue that tobacco is a "sin market", where there's not that much demand elasticity, so even in difficult economic times people will still smoke it.

So why did these stocks lose almost half of their market cap since 2017? What am I missing?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Long Term Investing Hey guys,

I'm completely new to investing and I'm looking for some advice. I'm not interested in day trading, leverage or anything of that nature. 

I'm looking to invest roughly 50 euro a month with a view to not touching anything for 5/10 years, possibly more. 

I was just wondering what would be the best platform to use to conduct my business and the pitfalls to investing in such a manor.

Thanks in advanced_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Why everyone is mad at Andrew left Nio initially rallied on analysts upgrades and now ONE short seller coming with his thoughts dragged it from 54 to 40 (44 at close) just tells you the power of panic it caused to retail investors. 

The desicion is yours either you hold and keep buying every dip thus agreeing with the other analysts or sell out of panic following his advice. The stock was overhyped anyway and he just decided to come up with his report 2 days before Q3 earnings. 

Now I see 2 scenarios:

1) people selling after earnings to book profits(this scenario is getting less likely with today sell off) . 

2) people riding it up with DCA strategy till January at which Nio day will see some activity around it. (more likely IMO).

Bottom line: the stock was already overhyped and Andrew left just saw a good chance to short it. He may have just saved Nio from the after earnings sell off thus paving the way for a justified rally based on a good earnings report._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Citron’s NIO short report is fake news This entire selloff was pretty much fueled by a few sensationalist headlines such as "Citron Pulls Plug on NIO" along with a price target pulled out of the ass of a non-analyst with a history of making false and misleading statements intended to manipulate the market to his benefit. If you're unfamiliar with Andrew Left, the name Citron Research probably sounds like something along the lines of a legitimate investment firm when you see it in a headline. It’s really just one guy with a blog and a lengthy track record of lawsuits for baselessly attacking stocks in an attempt to profit off their downfall. He [sold NIO at $10 in 2019](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/citrons-andrew-left-sells-out-of-chinas-tesla-rival-nio-2019-02-26) and has clearly been fuming over the profits he’s missed in the past months. Keep in mind, this guy has [shorted Tesla](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/andrew-left-shorting-tesla-stock-again-reasons-citron-betting-against-2020-2-1028876660) over and over without any luck, calling its meteoric rise artificial and insustainable, purely driven by hype. Now he’s shorting NIO on the same premise. Calling out its lack of short interest (aka optimism) also fails to corroborate his rationale for the stock falling to $25 - why even include that? 

On to his main point, which is that Tesla’s Model Y is expected to move to a starting price of ¥275k (~41k USD), spelling trouble for NIO’s competing ES6 and EC6 (currently starting at ~54k USD each). This ¥275k price projection is based on one Chinese analyst’s report and can essentially be taken with a grain of salt until Tesla says something confirmatory. Additionally, Left is either being incredibly naïve or incredibly disingenuous to assume NIO would roll over and allow itself to be outcompeted by a cheaper car model. This is a Chinese company we’re talking about. Left conveniently failed to make any mention of NIO’s upcoming economy models such as the ES3 and ET5 (the former being less than a year away with an expected price point of ~30k USD), nor did he write at all about NIO’s uniquely lucrative BaaS program or its ventures into fashion, entertainment, formula racing and more. Taking this into account, I don’t think the competition is as steep as Left claims. Tesla’s market share in China has rapidly declined in recent months as native EV companies push it out, going from [21% in August](https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Electric-cars-in-China/Tesla-conquers-China-s-EV-market-with-taste-of-affordable-luxury#:~:text=Tesla%20doubled%20its%20China%20sales,to%2021%25%20from%206%25) to [10% as of 3 days ago](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jimcollins/2020/11/10/teslas-market-share-is-sliding-in-china-and-has-cratered-in-europe/?sh=31e2e2a36d7d). Left cites NIO’s 3% market share in China as a weakness, omitting the fact that only a year or so ago, this figure was very close to zero. NIO is years behind Tesla in terms of production capacity; he’s comparing apples to oranges and he knows it.

In conclusion, Andrew Left’s $25 price target is clearly not based on numbers and calculations - it’s based on how much he wanted to profit off this squeeze, which was probably millions. Guy is a scumbag short seller abusing his power to manipulate the market and I hope the SEC takes a close look at him._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Question about Chamath Palihapitiya and Slack Technologies Does anyone know if Chamath still owns shares in Slack Technologies? I've researched the stock before and was looking into it again but one thing I could not find concrete information on was former board member Chamath Palihapatiya's investment in Slack. He was removed from the board of directors for making unauthorized comments on the company after he was on CNBC pumping the stock and saying some pretty bold claims like Slack is the only enterprise stock worth investing in,  its a company that sells its software without having to pay money for marketing and sales, as well as making comments on Butterfield being an iconic CEO and his product being truly unique and revolutionary. Obviously Slack spends a ton of money on marketing and sales and that has only skyrocketed with their increased competition from Microsoft. Slack has tanked since IPO and its competitive advantage/moat has really been whittled down as well. I want to know if Chamath has bailed on this company after giving it so much publicity and also if anyone knows more details about why he was replaced as a board member as there was only one brief statement written on the company's PR on it some time ago.

I do not own WORK and do not plan to in the future, but I want to know why so many people follow this guy and are crazy about stocks like Virgin Galactic that he has taken public. To me his relationship with Slack seems like it could be a red flag for investing other companies he promotes.

&#x200B;

TLDR: Has Chamath sold all of his Slack stock and why was he replaced as a board member? Was it just because of the claims he made publicly that were not authorized or is there more to the story?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Besides Reddit, where do you get your stock advice?

(Bill Gates-backed Electric Vehicle battery supplier) [Bill Gates-backed Electric Vehicle battery supplier, QuantumScape, to "IPO"](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ja0oq3/bill_gatesbacked_electric_vehicle_battery/)

Before the month of November ends, Bill Gates-backed electric vehicle battery supplier, QuantumScape, will "IPO" under the ticker QS.  An earlier article can be found here:

[Tesla rival? Bill Gates-backed electric vehicle battery startup comes into limelight](https://www.foxbusiness.com/technology/quantumscape-tesla-batteries)

Recently, InvestorPlace had articles on the potential upside for QuantumScape, setting an approximate price target north of $25.

I, of course, disagree with that assessment (disclosure: long on warrants).

The EV space commands higher tech-based multiples than paltry multiples assigned to traditional auto companies, for a good reason.

Long before the current controversies, and just before the "IPO," Nikola (NKLA) closed at just under $34.

During the summer, electric truck startup Hyliion (HYLN) reached an all-time high of just under $56 (disclosure: was long on many warrants, currently still long on a select few warrants).

Next up, electric truck startup Lordstown Motors (RIDE) was given a $50 price target by BTIG's Gregory Lewis.  Had it not been for the Hindenburg short report on Nikola, this stock could have reached $40 or more before its "IPO" (disclosure: was long on many warrants).

In short, the short-term upside for QuantumScape (QS) could very well be 100% or more north of a cheap $19.50._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Whats your Kansas City Shuffle stock? While everyone's looking at TSLA, NIO, all the SPACs, what are you looking at that no one else is?

This is a good long term hold stock that will be seeing a huge surge early next year. 

Recommend keeping your eye on this one._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Pandemic or Not, Visa Remains a Growth Stock Stalking Its Biggest Rival, Cash Visa stock has made investors more than 1,000% over the past decade -- peppy for an organization that dates back to the Eisenhower administration. But here comes a gaggle of app-based hopefuls eyeing not just the toll roads that make credit cards work, but also the $2 trillion in worldwide revenues collected for payments of all kinds.

You know about PayPal (ticker: PYPL) and maybe Square (SQ) and Venmo. How about Remitly, Stripe, Circle, and Bolt? There are dozens more with Seussian names. To skip out on a dinner check with under-30s, just mock the encryption protocol of their favorite fintech platform, and tell them you'll froop them ticklecoins.

I spoke this past week with Visa (V) chief Al Kelly about the competitive landscape in payments. That's a sensitive subject now, because Visa is trying to buy a company called Plaid, which serves as a data go-between for banks and apps. For example, Venmo uses Plaid. This month, the Department of Justice sued to block the deal, alleging that it would deprive consumers of a potential alternative to Visa. Kelly calls the deal pro-consumer and says Visa will fight the suit vigorously. "We feel very, very good about that," he says.

Visa was spawned from the first true credit card -- the paper, $300-limit BankAmericard, launched in 1958. Bank of America kept the credit business but licensed the financial plumbing for cards to other banks. This eventually became Visa, and a rival system launched in 1966 became Mastercard (MC). Today, Visa links 70 million sellers with 3.5 billion account credentials issued by 13,000 banks. It collects fees per transaction for authorization, clearing, and settlement, and it sells add-on services for things like detecting fraud and increasing customer loyalty.

This year, I've come to view paying in cash and receiving change as the financial equivalent of shaking hands during a bilateral sneeze. Giving over a credit card for swiping, or sliding my own and pawing a number pad, is more like an elbow bump -- better, but do we really have to? Tap-to-pay is the norm in most of the world, but not the U.S. -- yet. Kelly says it will be common here soon. If past patterns from other markets repeat, tap-to-pay will bring a big jump in the percentage of U.S. transactions done with cards.

Card adoption is already climbing -- to 82.1% of in-store transactions from 78.7% in January, according to industry researcher The NPD Group. But opportunities for spending have shriveled. So, during Visa's fiscal year ended in September, revenues decreased 5%, to $21.8 billion, and earnings per share fell 7%, to $5.04. Visa is larger than Mastercard and is particularly dominant in debit cards, but Mastercard has been growing faster, especially in Europe. Both have been smaller for years than China's UnionPay.

Analysts call these networks card rails, and the bank-controlled Automated Clearing House, or ACH, system for money transfers, bank rails. Many upstart players operate as digital wallets that depend in part on card or bank rails, or else use cryptocurrency. Kelly says the payments industry is filled with "frenemies." For example, PayPal, the best-known digital wallet for online purchases, used to steer customers to cheaper ACH rather than Visa cards. Now, under a partnership, Visa gets equal footing with ACH, and PayPal makes inroads at stores using Visa's contactless mobile-payment technology.

Stocks in general trade at elevated valuations now, and growth stocks especially. Even so, Visa's price of 38 times this fiscal year's estimated earnings suggests that investors feel confident about its future role in payments, and its return to speedy growth. This fiscal year, earnings-per-share growth is pegged at just 9%, as the pandemic continues and then hopefully lifts. Early estimates for next year's growth put it at 24%. Beyond the tap-to-pay rollout and spending rebound, Visa is hoping to win over push transactions that use bank rails -- like tuition, rent, and wages. Banks will have a say, but they make good money on card businesses, and ACH is a nonprofit.

China is a wild card. Visa doesn't have a license to operate there domestically, so it partners with local players like AliPay to create new uses for travelers' Visa cards. But phase one of the trade deal between China and the Trump administration is supposed to open China to foreign payment companies like Visa. We'll see. For now, Kelly calls cash his biggest competitor. I'm Purelling just thinking about all that market share up for grabs.

The stock market is said to be driven by the battle between greed and fear. Right now, it looks more like hope and stupidity. The vaccine results announced this past week by Pfizer (PFE) are the best hope yet that the pandemic's end is in sight. That vaccine and perhaps others could receive emergency-use authorization within the next two months, and much of America could receive needle pokes in the first half of next year. Life could look normal by Thanksgiving 2021.

But the virus is raging like never before. We've turned simple advice -- keep a bit of distance or wear masks -- into a culture war. And Washington is distracted. That President Donald Trump is denying clear election results is folly. That an overwhelming majority of his party's senators won't speak up is dangerous. If it doesn't damage our democracy, it could kill us by the tens of thousands this winter from inaction on the virus. And it could cripple our economy again.

"Sell the vaccine," wrote Bank of America in an investment strategy note on Friday. It means to reduce holdings of risky assets ahead of what could be a difficult stretch before the economy reopens in earnest. Like Goldman Sachs, BofA is recommending a barbell strategy, with cyclicals on one side, but not distressed ones, and the sort of virus-immune tech stocks that have been flourishing all along on the other.

I know; I dipped too far into politics there for a moment. Media bias, a few will say, and they're right. I don't endorse politicians or parties, but secretly, I'm in the tank for science and representative democracy.

**Source: Barron's Article**_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Walmart VS Amazon. Why my money is on Walmart **Walmart Due Dilligence**

**PARTNERSHIPS** 

\- Partnership with Instacart 

Recently Walmart and Instacart have founded a partnership that will allow Walmart to use Instacart their same-day shipping service. \[Walmart and Instacart together make up for nearly 50% of the online grocery sales.\]( [https://secondmeasure.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GroceryDelivery-chart2png-1024x631.png](https://secondmeasure.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GroceryDelivery-chart2png-1024x631.png)) Walmart’s vast inventory and Instacart their network and experience will only strengthen their position as the dominant grocery delivery providers, and thus putting more pressure on Amazon. 

\- Partnership with Shopify

In addition to Instacart Walmart has also partnered with Shopify. This new partnership will allow third-party sellers to directly sell their items on the Walmart marketplace. This new partnership will greatly expand Walmart’s inventory while giving small businesses the opportunity to reach a bigger demographic. Walmart is expecting to add 1200 Shopify sellers in 2020. Listing an item on Walmart’s marketplace allows Walmart to pick up some fees and generate greater traffic to the website. Another interesting possibility to consider is the fact that Walmart could be used as a Shopify returns hub, with a Walmart being within 10 miles of 90% of the US population it is the ideal candidate for further strengthening their relation with Shopify and saving both parties a lot of money.

\- Partnership with ThredUp

Walmart has also partnered with Thredup. ThredUp is basically an online thrift shop for clothes and wearables. This brilliant partnership means Walmart can now offer both normal and high-end clothing on their marketplace for an affordable price and expose customers to nearly 750,000 pre-owned items. Who would’ve ever thought you could tell someone that you bought your Michael Kors or Calvin Klein at Walmart.

\- Google

Walmart has been partners with Google for over 3 years now. This partnership allowed Walmart to enter the domain of voice ordering groceries. Simply ask one of your Google devices to buy milk and it will add milk to your Shopping cart. This Partnership might just be the beginning of a strong bond between Google and Walmart as both companies are interested in competing with Amazon.

\- Microsoft (+ Possible TikTok acquisition) 

Walmart has been partnered with Microsoft for about 2 years with 3 more years to go. 

Since the partnership Walmart has been using the full range of Microsoft cloud solutions in a bid to accelerate their digital transformation, innovation and efficiency. 

**Acquisitions**

\- Bonobos, ModCloth, ShoeBuy, Moosejaw, Parcel

Let’s start at the beginning, with these acquisitions Walmart stated entering the e-commerce market in 2016-2017. Sadly, as is known none of these are particularly success stories with the companies being sold again, discontinued or CEO’s leaving. However, Walmart learned a lot from these companies and has used this knowledge to further try to expand in the e-commerce market.

\- Jet.com

The first big step in the fight against Amazon. When amazon acquired Jet.com it was a clear signal of what its intentions were. Jet.com was one of the fastest growing U.S. e-commerce companies and Walmart acquired them in September 2016. Since then a lot has happened, Jet.com has been discontinued but the knowledge, progress and technology gained due to Jet.com is irreplaceable and has given Walmart a brilliant boost into the e-commerce with their e-commerce sales increasing 29%. Furthermore (ex)CEO of jet.com Marc Lore is now the CEO of Walmart’s e-commerce.

\- Flipkart

Ever heard of the small startup company called Flipkart? Maybe you have not, you should though. Flipkart owns 35% of the Indian e-commerce market, a true giant. Walmart acquired Flipkart in 2018 and ever since then it has been expanding its influence in India and fighting against Amazon for market dominance. This year Flipkart took over Walmart’s 28 Indian stores in order to expand its wholesale growth. Another interesting thing is that Walmart might make Flipkart public within the next 3 years.

\- TikTok acquisition 

Some very recent news of their Partnership with Microsoft is to potentially acquire TikTok. TikTok’s enormous userbase and the current pressure in the US and India have made for an interesting situation causing the partnership to push forward in the bid to acquiring TikTok. In my opinion Walmart has a very decent chance of getting TikTok and making it work. One factor that plays a big role in this is Walmart’s presence in India due to Flipkart. Flipkart is India’s biggest online store for; phones, electronics, books, home appliances, etc. With Walmart having a presence in both countries where TikTok is (going to be) banned might mean some positive things for the future, but for now that is speculation. The acquisition of TikTok would allow Walmart to use its genius algorithm and massive userbase to further promote and integrate its Walmart marketplace.

**Walmart PLUS**

Since September Walmart has its Amazon competitor called Walmart plus. It will give numerous benefits to the user such as; Unlimited free delivery (with 2700 stores having same day delivery), fuel discounts and scan&go a tool to make shopping faster, all for the price of $98 per year

**2 Hour Delivery**

Walmart recently launches its new delivery service, called Express Delivery. This new service will allow customers to place their order online and receive their groceries (for a 10$ fee) within 2 hours. Walmart express delivery is currently available in 800 stores with plans to expand to 2000 stores. In addition to 2-hour delivery Walmart also offers same-day delivery in almost the entire United States.

**Drone Delivery**

Walmart has recently partnered with **THREE** drone delivery companies; Flytrex, DroneUp & Zipline. With these partnerships Walmart will increase it’s focus on cheaper and faster home delivery. The key takeaway from these companies is to remember that 90% of Americans live within 10 miles of a Walmart. These drones will be able to cover almost the entire American population. Currently it’s still in the pilot phase but Walmart is showing great ambitions and a clear trajectory for the future.

\- Flytrex

Flytrex has drones that can carry up to 6.6 pounds worth of goods for a distance of 3.5miles and back. The test for Flytrex will be in Fayetteville, North Carolina.

\- Zipline

Zipline provides medical supplies in Rwanda and Ghana and has recently gotten permission to deliver medical supplies to medical facilities in North Carolina. The drones have a range of 50 miles and fly at a speed of 63mph, it can carry up to 3.5 pounds of cargo.

\- DroneUp

DroneUp their drones are initially used to assist commercial industries and public sector entities with aerial data collection solutions. However, they will be delivering Coviv-19 test kits for single family residences within a 1-mile radius of designated Walmart Supercenters.

\- Cruise, Udlev, Ford, Waymo

Okay so its not really drone delivery but autonomous delivery. Walmart has partnered with all these companies in order to experiment and expand into autonomous delivery. Another amazing step in it’s last mile delivery!

**5000+ US stores.**

This is Walmart’s biggest weapon. The thing Amazon lacks the most is physical stores. Walmart has over 5000 stores while Amazon has just over 600 (worldwide!). If Walmart can find a way to combine e-commerce with its enormous physical presence then it could give Amazon an absolute run for its money. Remember that 90% of Americans live within 10 miles of a Walmart.

**Some other interesting facts to consider.** 

\- 90% of US population live within 10miles of a Walmart.

\- Walmart’s e-commerce sales were up 97%

\- Walmart’s expansion in Africa. 

**Conclusion/TLDR**

Let me first state with you that this has been my first Due Dilligence and that English is not my first language.

Walmart is currently the underdog, and not many people are expecting them to properly fight Amazon. However, its recent spree of partnerships and acquisitions have been a brilliant and very clear move in the direction of e-commerce. If Walmart fully utilized its massive physical network together when their growing fresh e-commerce, I see no other outcome then for Walmart to grow, grow, grow. COVID-19 has given Walmart customers the push they needed to fully explore Walmart their marketplace, the marketplace that is now starting to fill up with thousands of sellers and endless products. The latest partnering with drone companies also shows that Walmart knows what the future hold and that they are ready to innovate and expand.

Walmart VS Amazon, here we go, my money is on Walmart.
