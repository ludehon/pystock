If that’s really the case, what’s the point in paying attention to news or business performance anyway, if it’s always going to be priced in?

A few weeks ago this nameless Reddit user said he was transitioning 60% of his portfolio into bonds until after the election was decided because he knew the market was going to go down.

He scoffed at my advice that investors who try to time the market often miss gains from some of the biggest trading days and can pay a huge price as a result.

Notably, the company completed its initial public offering (IPO) last September. Ever since, it has reported four quarterly earnings. In the last reported quarter, Cloudflare’s bottom line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 50%.

Management expects third-quarter revenues between $102.5 and $103.5 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the top line is currently pegged at $103.1 million. Notably, the consensus mark for loss has remained unrevised at 5 cents per share for the past 30 days.

Cloudflare’s diversified customer base is anticipated to have aided top-line growth during the third quarter. At the end of the second quarter, the company had more than 3 million free and paying customers. Moreover, it had added roughly 7,000 new paying customers, bringing the total count to approximately 96,000 across more than 160 countries.

Large customers (annual billings of more than $100,000) were 637 at second-quarter end, up from the 536 recorded at the end of the first quarter. The company’s large customer base witnessed a CAGR of 80% during the 2016-2019 period. This momentum is likely to have continued in the to-be-reported quarter as well on elevated demand for its cloud-based solutions amid the pandemic-led remote-working wave.

Further, Cloudflare’s recurring subscription-based business model provides relative stability to its top line despite the COVID-19 pandemic-induced disruptions.

Additionally, solid demand for security solutions, which became imperative due to aggravated cyberattacks, bring-your-own device policies and a zero-trust approach, is likely to have supported the top line in the quarter under review.

However, Cloudflare’s significant exposure to small and medium businesses (SMBs), the worst-hit cohort by the pandemic, might have impeded growth during the quarter to be reported.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/whats-store-cloudflare-net-earnings-135701644.html_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ A wild three days for clean energy Just as a disclaimer Im not telling anyone to buy clean energy. Do your own research. Im just trying to put some analysis on the gyrations in the last three days. But the stocks in clean energy seem to be closely predicated on election results and what do we know from the last three days? 

Firstly, a blue wave was predicted from sites like 538 and Politico and of course Reddit but this site has become as big of an echo chamber as our Aunt's Facebook feed. Notwithstanding, those in the know were betting on a blue house, a blue senate, and a blue presidency. If that happens clean energy stocks shoot up because there might be legislation, incentives for companies, etc. Lets just take ICLN for instance. Again, Im not recommending this ETF at all, its just easy, its just clean energy in there, nothing else. We saw it have a pretty good run-up to the election because the smart money was on blue in this election.

Now, what happened on election night? There was no blue wave, that was for sure. It looked like Biden would squeak out a victory but the Senate would go red, leading to gridlock. Wall Street liked the gridlock part and the likely stimulus part so the market rocketed up yesterday. But clean energy went the other direction. Right when the market opened ICLN was down over 4%. Why? Smart money was wrong on blue. No blue wave, no green new deal, no incentives for energy, nothing passing with a Red Senate. Eventually throughout the day ICLN gained some ground but finished the day horribly juxtapositioned with an incredibly strong market day. ICLN ended down 1.29% and QQQ ended the day up 4.46%, one of the strongest days of the year for the market. Quite a disparity between ICLN and QQQ.

But if you look at pre-market you will see ICLN up more than 6% in pre-market trading. Thats a pretty incredible pre-market surge. Just as a caution sometimes you have to be careful pre-market. Trades of only 500 shares or something will come in and it will make the futures look wonky. But as of 8am CST ICLN had traded over 40K pre-market. That never happens. Average volume is only 3 million. So what the  fuck is going on with clean energy this morning? 

The answer, in a word, is Georgia. Republicans right now safely control 50 seats in the Senate headed for a sure 51 with Perdue in Georgia. Perdue garnered over 52% of the vote for Senate, easily outdistancing Democratic challenger Jon Ossoff. So that would make for a Red Senate. However, something crazy happened overnight in Georgia. As of this morning Perdue is still well ahead. But here is the crazy part. His percentage now is 50.00%. Most of the remining votes are from Atlanta and that leans more democratic. And here is the even crazier part. In Georgia if you don't get more than 50% of the vote, it doesn't matter how much you won by you don't become the Senator. You have to go to a new run-off race in January. And with no Trump at the top of the ticket the race would be close but favorable to Democrats. The other race in Georgia is already going to a run-off. What happens if Democrats win both races in Georgia in January? A 50/50 Senate split. Right now it looks like Biden will win the presidency, barring some unforseen calamity. What happens on 50/50 ties? Kamala Harris gets the tiebreaking vote. So essentially Georgia could lead the way to a Blue senate, that is the difference today. How do a Blue Senate and Blue House and Blue Presidency affect clean energy? The 6% up pre-market should be a clue. Was it a blue wave? Definitely not. A blue ripple? I would say yes._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Another 751,000 Americans filed new unemployment claims last week https://finance.yahoo.com/news/initial-jobless-claims-week-ended-oct-31-2020-coronavirus-pandemic-185012800.html

&#x200B;

 **November 05, 2020**

NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) announced today further details regarding the proposed spin-off of its Upjohn Business and the subsequent combination of Mylan and the Upjohn Business to form Viatris Inc. As previously announced, Pfizer has set the close of business on November 13, 2020 as the record date for the spin-off, and the combination of Mylan and the Upjohn Business is expected to close on November 16, 2020.

No action is required by Pfizer common stockholders to receive the distributed shares of Viatris common stock. Pfizer stockholders who hold Pfizer common stock on the record date and do not sell those shares "regular-way" prior to the distribution date will receive a book-entry account statement reflecting their ownership of Viatris common stock or their brokerage account will be credited with Viatris common stock. In addition, Pfizer stockholders will retain those shares of Pfizer common stock.

Pfizer has been advised by Nasdaq that a “when-issued” market for Viatris common stock will exist beginning on November 12, 2020, the date that is the business day immediately prior to the record date for the spin-off, and continuing until the close of business on the expected closing date of November 16, 2020. During this time, a Pfizer stockholder will have the option of selling the right to receive shares of Viatris common stock in the spin-off while retaining shares of Pfizer common stock. This option will be available under the temporary Nasdaq symbol **“VTRSV”**.

In addition, Pfizer has been advised by the New York Stock Exchange that the following markets will exist in shares of Pfizer common stock in connection with the closing of the transaction:

* **Pfizer common stock “regular way” market (NYSE: PFE)**: If a Pfizer stockholder sells shares of Pfizer common stock in the “regular way” market beginning on November 12, 2020, the date that is the business day immediately prior to the record date for the spin-off, and continuing until the close of business on the expected closing date of November 16, 2020, that Pfizer stockholder will be selling both his or her shares of Pfizer common stock and the right (represented by a “due-bill”) to receive shares of Viatris common stock in the distribution. Pfizer stockholders should consult their brokers before selling their shares of Pfizer common stock in the “regular way” market during this time period to be sure they understand the effect of the NYSE “due-bill” procedures. The NYSE “due-bill” process is not managed, operated or controlled by Pfizer, Viatris or Mylan.
* **Pfizer common stock “ex-distribution” market (NYSE: PFE WI)**: If a Pfizer stockholder sells shares of Pfizer common stock in the “ex-distribution” market, which will begin on the record date for the spin-off, November 13, 2020, and continue until the close of business on the expected closing date of November 16, 2020, that Pfizer stockholder will be selling only his or her shares of Pfizer stock, and will retain the right to receive shares of Viatris common stock in the distribution.

Trades under the symbols "VTRSV" and "PFE WI" will settle after the closing date of the combination, which is expected to occur on November 16, 2020. If the combination is not completed, all trades under these temporary symbols will be cancelled.

If the combination is completed on the expected closing date of November 16, 2020, then beginning on November 17, 2020 (the first trading day after the closing), shares of Pfizer common stock will no longer trade in the “ex-distribution” market, shares of Pfizer common stock that are sold in the “regular way” market will no longer reflect the right to receive shares of Viatris common stock and shares of Viatris common stock will no longer trade in the “when-issued” market.

Right now the price is 9.50 and I'm going to sell the call at 11. Is there anything wrong with doing this? I have 10k in the total portfolio and it is diversified. Am I taking on too much risk buying 100 shares of EVRI? I have a list of questions I have below.

1. Is there any way I will lose money other than the stock going down? I am prepared to hold for a long period of time.
2. Is there any way to maximize the profit from the call? Such as selling different strike prices and time periods?
3. Anything you know about EVRI that I don't? More information is always useful, so anything you say will help.
4. Do you think EVRI is a volatile enough stock that I will significantly miss out on gains because of the option? I would sell it anyway with my exit strategy of 15% but I want to see if I am selling the option for a fair price.
5. Is there any reason I would want to sell a covered call ITM or ATM? It doesn't make any sense but if you know anything I don't please share. Someone must be selling the ITM options so why are they doing so?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Lemonade's (LMND) management team seems pretty impressive Their CEO Daniel Schreiber has 20+ years of experience in tech entrepreneurship and seems pretty smart after watching a few of his presentations and interviews. The COO Shai Wininger founded Fiverr and worked as both the CTO and CPO of Fiverr.

Their CIO John Peters has 15+ years of experience working at Mckinsey and Liberty Mutual. Right now LMND's loss ratio is below the industry average and Schreiber said that Peters + their machine learning is the major reason why.

Their CBO Dan Ariely designed the core of Lemonade's business model and was a favorite student of Nobel Laureate Daniel Kahneman. He also taught at MIT and has a couple of PhDs in cognitive science and marketing.  Which might be why Lemonade's marketing is extremely good.

Anyways I have bought a bunch of shares a 3-4 weeks ago, and am happy that it has risen 15% in the past couple of days.

It seems that there aren't any topics that really talk about Lemonade's management team when I think thats a gigantic factor on whether a company will be successful in the long run. So I wanted to add this topic to r/investing for people to discuss._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_
