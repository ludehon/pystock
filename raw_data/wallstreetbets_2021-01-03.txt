 Moves to make before Georgia election Tuesday- Green energy and weed I work fairly high up in campaign consulting. I work with Dems, but have been extremely pessimistic on the Dems chances of winning in GA this week. As of today, I think Warnock has about 60% chance of winning and Ossoff 55%.

Why is this relevant to all 1.8m world renowned entrepreneurs of WSB? We'll see green energy, weed, perhaps firearms stocks shoot up if Dems secure both Senate seats.

So, what moves are you making in preparation? 

Positions: 2,000 shares ICLN, 10,000 shares APHA (because I'm a bagholding piece of shit), and of course 5,000 GME that I sleep with under my pillow every night, and 10,000 PLTR. Many many many calls expiring worthless._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ 2020: the year retail investors outperformed hedge funds 14:1 _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ NIO $50 Call 01/15 bought at 2x its current value. Thoughts? Hello fellow retards,

In mid-November, I made a very stupid purchase and bought $50c with Jan 15 exp at $8.35. 

My call went down as much as 64% as of Dec 28, but I held. In the past week, it‚Äôs gained close to 30%. Overall, the call is now worth $4.15, ~50% below my purchase price.

Given the recent great news regarding December and 4Q20 deliveries as well as NIO day on Jan 9, what do you think I should do with my call? 
- Hold until then to limit my losses given the uptrend? or 
- Do you think it‚Äôs worth roll it over to March-May call?

Thanks retards!

Best,
A fellow retard_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Accurately predicted future of Melvin and GME üöÄüöÄüöÄ _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ MOVIE THEATERS ON MARS?! (DD) üöÄüöÄüöÄ What up you gay nerds. Here's 4 reasons why movie theaters will NOT go bankrupt and why they will rebound by March 2021. (DD)

1) Stock offerings. These are bound to happen. Movie theaters have been among the companies hit the hardest during this global pandemic and raising money through stock offerings are not unique to movie theaters. However, I can tell you, as a veteran of the stock market, stock offerings of this volume are NOT an action taken by companies about to go bankrupt. It is merely to stay afloat. They know that positive news is coming, and those who benefit are those who don't bearishly think bankruptcy is an option for a powerhouse movie theater brands. Don't shell out your hard-earned $5 on RH gold to read bullshit from bear-cuck analysts like Morningstar and buy shares instead. Thank me later.  
 

2) Adaptation. We are adapting to this pandemic. We now understand COVID-19 to be a droplet-transmissible disease that can be prevented by wearing a mask and taking basic precautions like washing your hands before eating/touching your mucous membranes. As a hospital administrator, I work with both friends and family who work intimately with COVID positive patients for HOURS in the ICU and ED and none of them have contracted it... why? Because PPE WORKS! (goddamnit anti-maskers). When Biden steps into office, you will immediately see a rise in movie theater stocks, as they are often the first to rebound because we all understand it's upward potential. In the next month, as the highest at risk (elderly/those with predisposed symptoms) receive their second dose of vaccinations, we will see a declining number of severe cases, leading to a sharp decrease in ICU hospitalizations. This news will be good for movie theaters. As the general public receives the vaccine, we will see public confidence returning and many will return to the theaters (with masks of course).  
 

3) Demand. We've all been stuck inside for almost a year, watching the same Netflix shows as our parents. Fun fact: Movie theaters BOOMED in the 30s post-Spanish flu, because humans have an inherent need to watch flicks on the big screen. Think of all you retard autists and how you're going to try and spit game after a year of staying in. Fuck that. Take your date to the theaters and talk about something relatable besides that you gained 20 pounds ordering from Uber Eats every day for the past year.  
 

4) AM\*+ (Yes, A\*C+ is the rebrand of \_\_\_ premier, the streaming service for \*MC and it is a critical reason for why they will stay in business and thrive.) The Walking Dead Season 10 is out by the way (surprisingly good, considering they killed off most of the OG cast). Subscription goes for $8.99 a month and counts estimate over 1 million new subscribers in 2020. Do the math and expect this to bolster stock price at the next earning report.

&#x200B;

TLDR; Those who buy in now to movie theater stocks should see 100-200% gains by Spring 2021. Quote me on it. Ban me if it doesn't happen._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Why Index Funds are Not as Safe and Bubbles are Not as Destructive as You Might Believe According to Morningstar research in the middle of 2019 almost half of all US stocks were part of some passive index fund. This number almost doubled since 2009. In the meantime, active management is on a steady decline, especially active managed funds. Around the same time Dr. Michael Burry compared index funds to CDOs. Let‚Äôs look into this case and try to draw something from it for our benefit.

**1. How come index funds are compared to CDOs if they only track industries or sectors of economy?**

What we often miss is that the index fund, instead of being a neutral observer, is an active participant in the fundamentals of the companies that compose a particular index. The fund does so by providing capital and influencing market value of a security (this also opens a window of opportunities for the company behind the ticker to raise capital via bank loans or private investments). What‚Äôs so bad about this? Well, passive funds don‚Äôt go through balance sheets, there is no fair value assessment, no analysis and no risk taking. They just buy whatever company is big enough to make it into the index. This company can then use provided capital to stay afloat or influence it‚Äôs price by share buybacks, dividends or simply pay huge bonuses to it‚Äôs management. Just like banks didn‚Äôt care about subprime mortgages that were packed into CDOs, index funds managers don‚Äôt care about what exactly goes into their ‚Äòsoup‚Äô. With the banks it was just greed and ignorance ‚Äì in case of index funds it‚Äôs by design.

When there is a stable influx of new capital into passive funds, zombie companies are dragged higher and higher. WSB goddess **Cathie Wood** called this the greatest misallocation of funds in the history. But why is so much cash flowing into index funds? Is it a trend? Is someone incentivized to promote them? Well, yes, but the main reason is different: boomer psychology and our friend, the FED. See, boomers have massive capitals. All those pension funds, retiring firefighters, trust babies, capital heirs ‚Äì they all seek safety. They don‚Äôt try to get 500% returns YOY or lose it all. They are very content with just beating inflation. Throw few percents above inflation and they will be over the moon. For a long time their favorite asset class were treasuries.

**2. What is happening to the bond market?**

In 2016 US bond market was almost $40 trillion in value, compared to less than $20 trillion for the domestic stock market.  Now, I haven‚Äôt seen yet the data about the size of US bond market of 2020, but everything points that it‚Äôs ratio to stock market is deteriorating. The US 10-year government-bond yield fell from nearly 2.00% at the beginning of the year to an all-time low of just 0.31% in early March. That‚Äôs what Rick Rule called ‚Äòreturn free risk‚Äô, since allocating capital into these treasuries almost guarantees you to lose money to inflation.

https://preview.redd.it/q6r2fhqfu6961.png?width=1372&format=png&auto=webp&s=b72fad038a47ee1a0adca587881f46bafc25cc89

Look at what is happening in Europe: ‚ÄúThe ECB, which added 500 billion euros ($606 billion) to its pandemic bond buying program, is set to own around 43% of Germany‚Äôs sovereign bond market by the end of next year and around two-fifths of Italian notes, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. That‚Äôs up from around 30% and 25% respectively at the end of 2019... Trading volumes in bund futures have collapsed 62% since the ECB started buying bonds, according to Axa, while ranges the lifeblood of traders have nosedived across Europe. In both the safest and riskiest nations, this quarter‚Äôs spread between the highest and lowest yields is the tightest it‚Äôs been since at least the global financial crisis.‚Äù

The FED is doing quite the same. Buying bonds (including corporate) all over the place and lowering interest rates to the ground. What‚Äôs even more devastating for boomers is that there‚Äôs no hope on the horizon: the FED promises to keep interest rates low for the next few years. We are really heading towards Japan situation where the central bank is that fat ugly bully kid playing all by himself in the sandbox.

**3. Where to go if the bonds are not so hot?**

This all causes big money to chase the next best thing. What do people consider safe? Real Estate. And indeed it rose: according to Knight Frank Global House price index US housing prices rose 7% from Q3 2019 to Q3 2020. But that‚Äôs a lot of hustle for big money. And that is hardly a passive income, rather a career. So the next best thing is index funds. What can be better than tracking the whole US economy? Never bet against America, am I right? Even if we stumble upon a market crash sending S&P down ‚Äì the economy will recover, it always does, right? The influx of cash into ETFs is basically a self fulfilling prophecy: it drives prices up and those yearly returns get even more lucrative compared to *sexy* 0.31% provided by treasuries.

[The data shows that 2019-2020 saw again a spike in passive management allocation, but I couldn't find more up to date graph ](https://preview.redd.it/db73yu15u6961.png?width=692&format=png&auto=webp&s=3d03efe94938505122915c672d823855b779f6ef)

Even worse is that actively managed funds and bank investments start to, basically, replicate index funds. That is due to the risk/reward factor: if the funds outperform the market - they get some good rep and few new customers; but when they underperform the market ‚Äì they get absolutely obliterated. Only few outsiders can risk picking deep value stocks or plays, that are not common portfolio dwellers. Or it takes someone with huge authority like Warren Buffett or Howard Marks.

**4. Bubbles everywhere**

Now, at this point you might be on the edge of your seat, banging your fist and thinking that this is nothing but a bubble and the boomers, index funds and the FED are to blame. Well, it is. Hard truth is that fundamentals in the long run always kick-in. So-called Buffett indicator (total stocks market cap to GDP) is almost at a record high. And on top of that we have Dot.com bubble 2.0 with crazy tech enthusiasm. And a second real estate bubble too. But I urge you to notice, that bubbles are not all the same with the same outcome. Well, they all go burst, but that‚Äôs not the point. There are bubbles that I would call ‚ÄòGeneral Market Heat‚Äô - situations when too much money goes into the market, causing it to overheat. Then some sort of event, panic, fear, or rumor, not necessary caused by declining fundamentals, sends the market to downward spiral. As an example: panic of 1857, 1929, 1987, etc. The better the fundamentals were and the least the government gets involved ‚Äì the faster it rebounds. Those bubbles do nothing but attract more speculators and their only result is the number of bankruptcies. Then there are bubbles that I would call ‚ÄòThematic Bubbles‚Äô - those are dedicated to some specific industry or a number of particular stocks that are expected to grow enormously. Tulip Mania in Netherlands (1637), Railway Mania in UK (1840s), Video Games Crash of 1983, Dot Com Bubble (2000). They all chased some particular novelty and all landed on their faces. But doing so they provided huge capital to developing industries. Dot Com Bubble gave us rapid growth of internet usage. Video Games chase of the late 70s and early 80s gave us the golden age of arcade gaming and huge inventions in graphics and game tech. Railway Mania left Britain with the largest system of railroads in the world. And guess who is the biggest exporter of tulips and holds 49 % of the global flower market? Yep, Netherlands, to this day, almost 400 years since the mania!

This did not in any way benefit the majority of investors who went down with the bubble. But you can view this as a sacrifice of dumb and greedy people for the benefit of the progress. I get a sense of pride in this noble cause, as a member of WSB community.

Back to boomers and index funds. By pouring money into index funds they provide capital both to disruptive industries and to zombie companies. The good thing is that the tech gets the majority of it, since it has the biggest share. Just look at the SPY top 6 holdings:

https://preview.redd.it/ien160wku6961.png?width=361&format=png&auto=webp&s=b4fb8528478110ff0f2d5f9e1a793d7b5e5a9085

It‚Äôs genuinely good that companies like Tesla will get allocation of billions and billions which they (frankly) do not quite deserve at current fundamentals. This will accelerate their growth. The bad thing is that such allocations cement big tech monopolies, damaging competition. And it also provides liquidity to zombie companies big enough to make it into indexes.

Difference is that innovative companies use this cash to reinvest into future growth. That‚Äôs exactly why their P/E ratios are so bad. Zombies spend cash on buybacks and management bonuses. Because of how all these companies are tied together in index funds and due to the nature of modern margin calls ‚Äì once any segment of the stock market falls, there will be a massive dip. Tech can drown any industry stocks with them and vice versa. But the Tech will be able to cut investments, R&D and expansions and become profitable, while zombies with a big debt will go bankrupt. Either way it‚Äôs investors, who will bear the pain.

**5. What shall we draw from here:**

&#x200B;

1. There are huge inflows into the stock market. And the blame is not so much on the kids with RH as it is on the boomers and ‚Äòsmart money‚Äô chasing index funds;
2. If you want to short any of the bubbles as a hedge ‚Äì do not short the most growing and volatile sectors and ETFs like QQQ, because they benefit from the current market in a long run. And also the premiums are huge due to IV. Rather short slow and steady industries, because they will get nuked just as much in case of a crash, but the premiums you pay now will be much lower;
3. Passive index funds investing makes ‚Äòprice discovery‚Äô and a search for deep value so much more challenging. But not impossible. Basically, Peter Lynch‚Äôs advise to look for companies with smaller institutional ownership still lives up today. Does this mean that prices can‚Äôt be good or go up under big index allocation? Hell no. But the chance to find a ten-bagger declines.As an anecdote: look into our champion‚Äôs GME institutional ownership: on Jan 31 2020 it was 96.6 % and declined to relatively low 66.7 by Sep 30. Exactly before it doubled in the next 3 months;
4. Some bubbles provide needed capital to developing and hyped industries causing structural change. Unfortunately, it is paid by investors who rarely see any return;
5. FED is to blame for everything (as always);
6. WSBers will lose money either way (as always).

&#x200B;

**TL;DR:**

**The bond market is similar to boomers wives: sexy in the 80s, not so much today. Constant intrusions by their relatives (the FED) into their relationships makes things even worse. That sends boomers chasing young girls - the stocks. But their dongles aren‚Äôt so active anymore, so boomers prefer passive approach, using a dating app - index funds. Unfortunately, there are only so many hot girls among young ladies on the app. This leads to ugly ones receiving attention and money from boomers, which they otherwise wouldn‚Äôt deserve. Some of those ladies spend money wisely and will be good to go once the boomer dies out. Others immediately waste it on shopping. Now, if a young man wants to find a truly beautiful lady with reasonable expectations ‚Äì he has a better chance searching outside of the boomer dating app.**

üöÄ  üöÄ  üöÄ_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ GME DD from a Software Engineering perspective (Holding \~1500 of GME due to other DD)

However, a fundamental crux of GME's future is the development of ecommerce. This implies that GME needs to hire software engineers and really up their tech game so that [gamestop.com](https://gamestop.com) doesn't suck. They likely need xbox and ps5 apps, maybe a pc app as well that competes with steam.

To embrace digital, they need highly paid, highly skilled engineers that get to develop shit with the latest and greatest tech. Naturally, I searched for Gamestop Software Engineering jobs. The results are pretty lackluster and have me a little worried.

Not only are there very few job postings, but the postings available have shit job titles and shit job descriptions, requiring experience with dated technology. I'm hoping to see some departures soon and some Silicon Valley tech bro get hired to build out a proper engineering team. But as of today, the outlook is not good.

1. zero work from home positions
2. job titles:  "**Advanced Engineer, Software",**  "**Lead /Web Department"**
3. experience required: "Expert knowledge on related technical skill sets and technologies including but not limited to .NET framework 3.5/4.0, C#, ASP.NET, MVC, HTML, JQuery, JQuery Mobile, Javascript, VBScript, Continuous Integration Build, IIS 7.0, Windows Communication Foundation, AppFabric, Windows Workflow Foundation, Visio, TFS, REST, XSLT, SQL Server, and Agile Development Methodologies, Unit testing", "Proficient knowledge of web services and SOAP", "Knowledge of Microsoft BizTalk, Tibco, or other messaging platforms preferred"
4. [Poor salaries](https://www.glassdoor.com/Salary/GameStop-Software-Engineer-Salaries-E1162_D_KO9,26.htm)

**It is possible they are contracting a lot of work out to consultants and third-party vendors that know how to write code in the 21st century**. But currently none of the positions they are hiring for would attract any engineer that's actually worth hiring.

edit 2: No they don't need to hire \~$300K devs and create GME Cloud Services. But any devs they're hiring right now are probably doing more harm than help in the long-run. The thought is that RC influence would fix this. I was naively optimistic about it already being in the works.

TLDR; I am long GME but their ecommerce and digital future require a good software engineering organization. They currently don't have one nor are they hiring one based on open job postings. This makes my butthole kinda tight. I am sad to actually point this out. Thoughts?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Upgraded to official financial forum per Ameritrade _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ when PLTR, GME etc TO THE MOON doesn't work out _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $PLTR is going to have a great week (proof FT. $TSLA) _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Ten(die) Traits of the TENBAGGER ($PLTR, $RKT, $TSLA)  Fellow smooth brains, broke boiz, and gainz girls,

I've had a lot of down time this week since I'm cooped up in q-tine with the vid. Figured I'd change it up and spend time to listen and read about people who actually made money in the markets, instead of edging to EOY loss porn for 10 days straight.

I found a few different hedge fund daddies to keep me company during the alt reality of rona isolation. These dudes weren't smooth brain; they read books and wrote them too. They made all their tendies in the pre-dawn era before the internet, but a lot of their concepts are the foundations of today's DD flair.

One of these hedge fund daddies is Peter Lynch; the silver fox averaged 30% returns over 13 years as manager of Fidelity's Magellan Fund. He frequently & routinely states "Stonks only go up" and "Buy the FKN DIP" in pre-internet era interviews and he's got a rager for the market advantages of individuals (retail, us, idiots) vs. wall street (chads, citron, warren buffet). He actually walked away from Wall Street at relatively young age to spend more time with his family. This decision can only be interpreted one way; he made enough tendies to send his wife's boyfriend back to instructing $PTON classes and preying on other men's wives. For this, the legacy of he Silver Fox must be immortalized - he is legend.

Anyway, Lynch is pretty famous for coining the characteristics (traits) of a ten bagger. Since I've got lots of time and there's no loss porn on the weekends, I thought it would be an interesting idea to back test some of these ideas on WSB favorites & active bag holders like $RKT, $PLTR, and $TSLA.

**10 Traits of a Ten Bagger:**

**1. Name is Dull or Ridiculous: All tickers check.**

¬∑ Red $RKT? Sheesh dude calm down.

¬∑ $PLTR? Fool of a took!

¬∑ $TSLA? That socialist electrician?

**2. It does something dull: All tickers check.**

¬∑ $RKT: Mortgage loan processing.

¬∑ $PLTR: Data aggregation & integration. wut?

¬∑ $TSLA: Sells cars.

**3. It Does something disagreeable: All tickers check.**

¬∑ $RKT: Online loan processing is perceived as untrustworthy by institutions & individuals.

¬∑ $PLTR: Blah blah blah oppression, NSA & data privacy

¬∑ $TSLA: "There will never be a market for EVs!"

**4. Institutions don't own & analysts don't follow: Only $PLTR checks.**

¬∑ $RKT: 15 analysts have coverage with an avg. PT of $24.7

¬∑ $PLTR: 7 analysts have coverage with an avg. PT of $15

¬∑ $TSLA: Everyone talkin' TSLA these days. Irrelevant.

**5. It's depressing: All 3 tickers check with some massaging of the interpretation.**

¬∑ $RKT: When I grew up, home loan refinancing was a bad thing borne from necessity. Exchanging equity for better loan terms prolongs payments and adds long-term interest. These improve affordability and increase in popularity with each recession.

¬∑ $PLTR: Literally sells system solutions for crisis situations. Think COVID/Conflict/Fraud.

¬∑ $TSLA: The narrative sells because the climate crisis is the defining issue of our age.

**6. The industry isn't growing: All 3 check with some massaging of the interpretation.**

¬∑ $RKT: Growth is not the same as appreciation. The housing market continues to spike in part because of archaic housing & city planning policies that prevent new supply from entering markets.

¬∑ $PLTR: New data points & software solutions continue to be introduced & sold, but PLTR is unique in it's integration & aggregation capabilities. Nobody else is selling this particular solution; in fact, PLTR views their biggest competition as a companies' desire to internalize this solution.

¬∑ $TSLA: EVs sales are in fact growing exponentially, however the sales are pulling demand from the existing market share of the automobile industry, not creating new market share. Additionally, modern transportation policy ***likely*** reduces the amount of new cars on the road as EVs are increasingly exposed as an edge case for addressing climate change. Also, ARK (momma Wood) has done a bunch of research re: the pending used-car bubble that will put further ownership equity pressure on loans, dealers, and individuals still buying used ICE cars. The combined pressures of costs associated with personal vehicle ownership, rapid asset depreciation, autonomous ride hailing, modern transpo plans focused on decreased congestion & emissions, will significantly reduce the size of this industry in the near/mid term future.

o P.S. I <3 Pete Bootycheeks, US Transpo Sec. Build all the rails & bike lanes.

**7. It's got a NICHE: All 3 check.**

¬∑ $RKT: mobile loan processing. Speed speed speed. Ease ease ease. Cheese cheese cheese. $RKT's solutions saves time, better prepare buyers & refinancers, simplifies the process, and reduces monthly expense. Rock solid like my $RKT in the mornings.

¬∑ $PLTR: how many of you work at a fortune 500 (not Wendy‚Äôs) that requires you to query data for routine reports? How many logins do you have? how many systems do you need to navigate? Do you know how your co addresses this? They pay managers who can't write =sumif() excel functions, to piece together PowerPoints and workflow diagrams that communicate system enhancements to $100k+ soft devs and system architects who then Frankenstein together 10+ paid SAAS "solutions" in 1-3 years. $PLTR comes in hot and ready like the domineos pizza pie delivery guy ready to feed & seed the shmeat lovers. $PLTR works with what you got, growers and showers, to create a highly scalable 2 way data integration & aggregation system in hours.

¬∑ $TSLA: Battery & self driving tech are the biggest niches at this point, but don't sleep on those EV credits. Wall street industry idiots are salty that $TSLA can improve margins by selling polluter permission slips to allow polluters to pollute, but co's love to pollute so those things print.

**8. Recurring Revenues: All 3 check.**

¬∑ $RKT: Definition of "Recurring": "occurring again periodically or repeatedly." $RKT reports a lot of money each quarter's earnings reports. Don't @ me.

¬∑ $PLTR: the business model is designed to scale billing in tandem with gains made from solution utility.

¬∑ $TSLA: At this stage, car sales are growing and we haven't hit an extended downturn in the cyclical environment. Just wait till the FSD, energy credits, insurance, ride hailing, and grid energy revenues print infinitely and indefinitely. Anticipate unrealized earnings & receivables to pace with earnings growth.

**-(9. Insiders are buying: $RKT & $TSLA check.**

¬∑ $RKT: Daddy Dan Gilbert & Juicy Jay Farner were loading up on shares < $20 in August

¬∑ $PLTR: Mithril (a Papa Thiel fund) got clearance to buy an s-ton of $PLTR at some point last week. Basically, a buy back, but we'll see more when the lock-up period ends.

¬∑ $TSLA: Denholym sold 43k shares at \~$400 per, but Emperor Elon is diamond handing his market cap option tranches which counts IMO.

**-(10. Its buying back shares: $RKT & $PLTR check.**

¬∑ $RKT: Announced a completed $1B buyback on the last earnings call

¬∑ $PLTR: Momma Wood (ARK) has been adding $1m+ in shares each week, but it basically just went public so too early for this.

¬∑ $TSLA: Issuing new funds to improve cash positions at elevated market cap.

Positions:

Buy the dip, LONG $RKT & $PLTR until $75b market cap, then readjust thesis. $TSLA to $1T market cap, then pivot into 2% divvie stocks till' I transcend into a Silver Fox incarnate.

Markets hate the presidency, senate and house going straight ticket. They both can spend and tax at will. Gridlock is Good.  

Looks like MM's drove the price up with low volume the last two weeks, the same as the chart above.  

$SPY Lost 1/3 of it's Value from 1/5/09 - 3/9/09  

If we follow the same $SPY track as 2009, and you bought 3/31 255p Monday, it would cost you $88 per contract

It would print roughly 1000-2000% & w/ IV kicking in; way more if we stay on the same track as the last two weeks and repeat a Georgia win.  

A 10k Bet Would Net Between 100-200k

Hedge with another 10k in slightly OTM $SPY Calls, if I am wrong.

Can be scaled up or down. I do expect tomorrow to start out, going way up, to suck up all that stimulus money first. Timing is key. This play does not work if $SPY is Anthony Stagnetti. Could shorten the length of the poots if you are risk aversive. But this is Wall Street Bets, not /r/investing

Electricity. 

With California and most of the PNW being on the PG&E grid and being a large chunk of the US population $PCG is INCREDIBLY undervalued as a stock. They‚Äôve had some hiccups in the last couple years, and they‚Äôve obviously learned from them because they‚Äôre still around. They can‚Äôt get rid of the entire electrical grid of the west coast and they don‚Äôt dare break it up during a pandemic because of the cost of such a move. $PCG is going into the new year with no new major fires in 2021, new leadership and new found reliability based purely on my own experience. 

Now to boring shit.
Balance sheets are looking good post settlement and the company is more than able to recover 100% in short order. With that being said they are going to be the largest energy market in the US, so it‚Äôs about time we get while we can, the next few days should be WILD.

**Last thing**:  Some stuff might be unsourced in this post but everything is sourced in the pdf version. While it‚Äôs not impossible that I might have missed some stuff, most of the time I put the stuff that I quote from other sources in italics. My ego is not big enough to feel like reformulating other people‚Äôs ideas and even less to steal other people's ideas. All I do is just gather insightful facts, figures, ideas and analysis.

# Big picture

## 1.1 Macroeconomic View

I will be brief here, I think everyone knows what‚Äôs up basically.

[Figure 1: although the USD is worth a lot less, the S&P 500 is doing alright. Thanks Jerome.](https://preview.redd.it/iqtnlebs96961.png?width=682&format=png&auto=webp&s=056c4261f530831621fb22bf4f4bf199e5e21f6a)

Enthusiasm is the key word here as we are in an environment with a very accommodative monetary and fiscal policy (thanks for the stimulus checks). Equities and Bitcoin hit record highs thanks to positive vaccine news and the markets hope for a fiscal package. The Federal Reserve is going heavy on asset purchases, bailouts and loans. And its balance sheet is expanding as well as money supply. Interest rates are extremely low.

Check for example, the [Shiller PE ratio](https://www.multpl.com/shiller-pe) to see the enthusiasm driving the markets.

On a macro-level side from the risks related to the pandemic, the only worrying signs would be the shrinking money velocity or a suddenly-rising inflation (hyperinflation is bullish for stocks but not for the real economy)

That being said, we know how the FED and the government reacted to support the economy and the markets. Low interest rates and weak US dollar which is continuing to depreciate is very bullish for stocks overall.

I keep the macroeconomic view very short for that GME correlation with the S&P 500 is low - about 28% over the last 6 months. Moreover despite GME‚Äôs heavy reliance on brick-and-mortar stores, GME continues to get closer to profitability even with the pandemic.

If the pandemic would make the stock market to crash again during the trade, I wouldn't sell at a loss but wait a few days and then buy a LEAPS. This is my plan. Don't follow it, just make sure you have a plan in case it happens, it's important to avoid buying too much the first dip (because you might get a better price later) or worse, avoid a panic-selling and take a loss instead of tendies.

## 1.2 Sector(s) View

[Figure 4: Video game market value worldwide from 2012 to 2023 \(in billion USD\)](https://preview.redd.it/zcaacwtnd6961.png?width=642&format=png&auto=webp&s=9e1ff470e54a8f9821f188793f7bbd2bee5d0986)

[Figure 5:  Retail ecommerce sales in the United States from 2017 to 2024 \(in million USD\)](https://preview.redd.it/51jh22amd6961.png?width=610&format=png&auto=webp&s=10993f493748a17354b3fb4e83dd7781da73c0f7)

Video game total adressable market and ecommerce total adressable market keep growing, that's all we need to know on a macro-level. Now, the real question is not about the market itself but about the compny business model.

# GameStop Corp.

* Market cap   $1.31B
* 1-year performance  209.87%
* Shares outstanding  69.75M
* Short interest   68.13M (97.68% of the outstanding shares)
* Held by insiders  Between 13.6% to 27.3%
* Held by institutions  Between 110.5% to 122.0%
* Owned by Ryan Cohen 12.9%
* Owned by BlackRock  17.1%

## 2.2 Timeline

&#x200B;

[Table 1: GameStop timeline.](https://preview.redd.it/0cx8brwjd6961.png?width=762&format=png&auto=webp&s=84f8c8be4a5cb3596703a03d399e34a4b227206a)

*Short-term the sector is pretty hot with quarantines and the launch of next-generation consoles which will impact positively year-on-year sales growth. The pandemic could have been an opportunity but GME has still too many physical stores and not enough ecommerce presence yet to take advantage of it.*

For the next earning release, the question is : how much PS5 and Xbox GameStop was able to get? And how much they sold in bundles (at high margins)?

Although it‚Äôs still unclear from what I‚Äôve found it‚Äôs pretty bullish:

*GameStop Corp. employees across the country were caught by surprise on Saturday when the video-game chain suddenly announced new shipments of the highly coveted PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X consoles* \- [bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-14/gamestop-employees-rattled-by-surprise-shipment-of-ps4-xbox](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-14/gamestop-employees-rattled-by-surprise-shipment-of-ps4-xbox)

**Figure 6** : [https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&geo=US&q=gamestop](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&geo=US&q=gamestop)

The recent **Microsoft deal** is extremely bullish for GameStop and could help the company to reach profitability sooner than expected. Here are the details about how it could impact GameStop‚Äôs profitability:

* *In years 3 and 4 combined, if just 5 million customers extend the subscription for two years, GameStop makes $180 million in incremental profit with zero cost involved. That's nearly a quarter of GameStop's current market cap in recurring income at 100% margin*. - Justin Dopierala, ‚Äú[GameStop Revenue Sharing Agreement With Microsoft Shifts Sentiment](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4378623-gamestop-revenue-sharing-agreement-microsoft-shifts-sentiment).‚Äù SeekingAlpha.

## 2.2 Business Model and Management

* Gamestop is omnichanneling into **online activities** according to Ryan Cohen recommendations although it doesn‚Äôt mean they will execute it perfectly this is bullish.
   * ‚Äú*GameStop needs to evolve into a technology company that delights gamers and delivers exceptional digital experiences ‚Äì not remain a video game retailer that overprioritizes its brick-and-mortar footprint and stumbles around the online ecosystem.*‚Äù Ryan Cohen.

[Table 2: GameStop is dangerously \(for the shorts\) getting close to profitability.](https://preview.redd.it/awmm34afd6961.png?width=562&format=png&auto=webp&s=e22229a87f8b29e59f43822c903a54893b9e3a6a)

* *The company attributes the losses this quarter to the end of the console cycle and the limited hardware and accessory availability that came with that, as well as various game delays, and an 11% reduction in its store base - partially offset by recaptured sales at other locations and online*. ‚Üí **The company should be profitable very soon** **despite being priced for bankruptcy for a long time ‚Üí Expectations are incrediblly low until recently, more investors are believing in the vision esp. with Ryan Cohen.**
* GME **e-commerce sales were up 257% year-over-year**.
* GME **reduced its selling, general, and administrative expenses by $115 million**.
* GME **repaid $10 million in debt in Q3 2020**.
* *GME is* ***diversifying sales to include more high margin items*** *like PC accessories, PC monitors, etc (If I speculate, there may be partnerships with certain brands).*
* ***Focusing on loyalty programs*** *like power ups and* ***rebranding***.
* As of Feb. 2020, GameStop had 5,509 physical stores.
* GME is **closing unprofitable locations**: they are closing 1,000 stores in Q1 2021 (by the end of March of 2021).
   * I‚Äôd like to quote a fellow GME gang member on this: *It's no secret that brick and mortar is falling off, and if GameStop were to fight tooth and nail to remain a largely brick and mortar retailer they would go bankrupt in no time. It is also a fact that underperforming stores drain cash, which lowers net income and thus lowers earnings per share. Any store that is LOSING MONEY or is barely breaking even is keeping the stock price down because it's preventing future growth and killing net incomes. Closing underperforming stores will lead to a higher EPS and more cash that can be allocated to growth.* \- horny131313.
* *Gamestop is rebranding, and shifting to becoming the one stop video game and video game related product online retailer. While we haven't seen exactly what this will be, it is bullish to see them pivoting into other products besides just video games. Headsets, TVS, PC parts, you name it. You've seen the omnichannel memes, but we know that If they are bullshitting, Cohen will step in. Expect to see real progress made.*

Some words from the last earnings:

* "*We anticipate, for the first time in many quarters, that the fourth quarter will include* *positive year-on-year sales growth and profitability*\*, reflecting the introduction of\* *new gaming consoles*\*, our\* *elevated omni-channel capabilities* *and continued* *benefits from our cost and efficiency initiatives*\*, even with the potential further negative impacts on our operations due to the global COVID-19 pandemic.\*" George Sherman, CEO.

Possible catalysts (from KYJELLYTIME69):

* A possible new Nintendo console release in \~1-2 years
* Currently distressed commercial REITs = ability to negotiate lower rent = more $$$
* Likely return of inflation (debatable but money supply ballooned and we are seeing velocity pick up a bit) with JPOW promising to keep rates at 0% even when inflation comes back = bullish for all stocks, bears will get slaughtered
* OG printer Yellen manning the treasury in a month + possible dem senate = more stimmy checks = more money going into GME
* If sales improve and balance sheets continue improve, we might see more credit upgrades
* Better sales = possible dividend reinstatement, I couldn't care less about dividends but guess who's going to be paying? The shorts lol. If Sherman had balls, he would pull an OSTK and announce a special dividend , which will actually lead to a short squeeze while wsb laughs collectively as we get meme returns from this boomer move.

## 2.3 The Short-Squeeze Thesis

&#x200B;

[Figure 6: Stare statistics from Oct. 2019 to Nov. 2020](https://preview.redd.it/juvh5y1bd6961.png?width=502&format=png&auto=webp&s=614c135c89f8d0e5a168e20c3e68cfd3005a5c7c)

**In terms of metrics**, the DTC (days-to-cover) actually decreases, lowering the probability to get a short-squeeze short-term. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, this DOESN‚ÄôT mean that it can‚Äôt happen, the % of shares shorted is still crazy high.

**Days to cover**: *It gives investors an idea of potential future buying pressure. In the event of a rally in the stock, short sellers must buy back shares on the open market to close out their positions. Understandably, they will seek to purchase the shares back for the lowest price possible, and this urgency to get out of their positions could translate into sharp moves higher. The longer the buyback process takes, as referenced by the 'days to cover' metric, the longer the price rally may continue based solely on the need of short sellers to close their positions. Additionally, a high 'days to cover' ratio can often signal a potential short squeeze. This information can benefit a trader looking to make a quick profit by buying that company's shares ahead of the anticipated event actually coming to fruition.* (Investopedia).

**In terms of corporate actions**, here is a quote from September mentioning the hostile takeover from Ryan which would trigger a massive short-squeeze, here is the explanation:

***Short Squeeze Potential -*** *If Ryan Cohen successfully negotiates a purchase price with the Board then the shareholders will have to vote on it. Unlike the proxy battle where Hestia and Permit were running a minority slate of directors, an offer to purchase GameStop would force institutions like Vanguard and Blackrock to call in their shares. By doing so, the shorts would be forced to close out their positions and GameStop would finally have the greatest short squeeze of all-time. Ironically, Cohen could use this opportunity to sell all of his shares and use the proceeds to entirely fund the acquisition of GameStop going down as the first person in history to acquire a billion dollar company... for absolutely nothing. In fact, his acquisition price would be less than zero. It will be exciting to see how it all plays out as according to Bloomberg/WSJ there are now 58 million shares short as of 8/31/2020 with only 65 million shares outstanding.*

*If I were short, I'd be sweating bullets right now. This won't end well and will ruin many*.

Justin Dopierala is President and Founder of DOMO Capital.

**How to know when the potential short-squeeze could happen?**

* *Massive volume in short dated calls. \[...\] If you have shares, DO NOT SELL COVERED CALLS FROM THEM. by doing this you make the likelihood of a squeeze decrease.* \- horny131313
* U*nwind their short position with some behind closed doors deal. A scenario like this could include: Melvin offering shares of other stocks at discounted prices in exchange for GME shares or to unload a portion of their short shares. The second party to this deal could also offer to buy GME shares for higher than market prices* \- horny131313

If you want to do a further analysis on short-metrics I put some additional figures - you might find some kind of pattern idk.

[Figure 7: Stare statistics of November 2020](https://preview.redd.it/aghjvh78d6961.png?width=614&format=png&auto=webp&s=ee9e5aad122b1a1c7f63dbcc1820a32ea19ce0bf)

[Figure 8: Share statistics of December 2020](https://preview.redd.it/ijbl9ay4d6961.png?width=438&format=png&auto=webp&s=cd9d0e786520d092df26cc80effa0dbe147cde2f)

[Figure 9: Available shares to short vs. fees in &#37;.](https://preview.redd.it/7sp7ni43d6961.png?width=777&format=png&auto=webp&s=42ac1cdfbfdc4e0dbe6b3b256893e885e876c74c)

## 2.4 Is GME Manipulated?

Maybe.

[I know there is actually a prob. with the &#37; daily returns \(it isn't equal to 100&#37; BUT the proportions still hold true on a non 100 point basis\). The main point is that: negative daily returns were much higher than positive ones.](https://preview.redd.it/xyzx8bl1d6961.png?width=717&format=png&auto=webp&s=efcf0647ba66214ff5fbb75f177f65d3cdb053d3)

If you are familiar with the stock market, you might have noticed that winners do not act like this usually: total return was +21% yet there has been 53.3% red days. If you look at regular stocks which have positive cumulative returns it doesn‚Äôt happen that often (outliers aside).

This is why I suspect that the stock is being manipulated but the weird stats might be explained just because the stock kept being shorted although it was not enough to keep the price down.

Another opinion on this:

* *Melvin and BoA both have short positions, and are desperately trying to drive the price down. Unfortunately, it is getting harder and harder to convince people that gamestop is a failing business. They are sweating and will continue to sweat. Given the buy side volume, they could close these short positions gradually without triggering a massive squeeze, however it WILL drive the price up significantly higher than it is now.* \- horny131313.

## 2.5 What 2020 Has Taught Us?

I think at this point it is the wrong question to ask (*is the stock being manipulated?*). To me, the most important thing is what is the upside potential and the risks associated? Then, how to trade GME?

* *If you're new to gamestop, the volatility will seem scary but the shorts fight hard with this one. -10% days followed by +20% days are not unusual.* \- horny131313

I would like to elaborate on this very idea. For this, check GME statistics for 2020:

https://preview.redd.it/t05xum2zc6961.png?width=764&format=png&auto=webp&s=b2e092560bba3b3091a6fe8bf0bceea2ce7b9f5c

https://preview.redd.it/odbxo3sxc6961.png?width=772&format=png&auto=webp&s=7897f1dac841aa381b916046c3652e2d2c4ece68

* Whether the stock is manipulated or not, MOST of the 2020 trading days were negative.
* The worst daily returns were hard to handle honestly we are talking multiple worst than 14% daily drawdowns.
* You could more than triple your money WITHOUT LEVERAGE.
* Let‚Äôs say you bought late Apr. and sold late Aug. you could have been at -13% returns and +31% the next week if you had diamond hands. For the real diamond hands you had +147% returns the next 2 months.

Psychologically this was a hard trade for sure. But for those who had diamond hands, it was pretty amazing. If you don‚Äôt feel comfortable being at -20% or even -30% returns for months before the stock literally BLOWS UP‚Ä¶ Reduce your position and diamond hand with a smaller size. Better to win with less than lose with a lot‚Ä¶

**TLTR: DIAMOND-HAND THIS OR DON‚ÄôT TRADE THIS AT ALL.**

# Risks

## 3.1 Upside Risks

* RC Ventures LLC increases its stake.
   * It could be VERY soon. On the 31 December 2020, someone bought 900K shares, it could be Ryan Cohen given the size of its last purchases:

[ Figure 10: Last RC Ventures GME Purchases. Notice how the biggest numbers \(e.g. 800K & 500K\) while the smaller ones weren't \(e.g. 320K, 256K or 128K\).](https://preview.redd.it/j73tsjhuc6961.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=edd9813501b1af9aa9d0634702fcd4e2507e788e)

[Figure 11: Check who tweeted this on the same date as the 900K shares purchase?](https://preview.redd.it/9j3hgvksc6961.png?width=529&format=png&auto=webp&s=2a9188f79a155f4f97a29f3f48fcce02a3a93701)

**EDIT :** ***the recent 900K-share purchase after hours were not "purchases", it was quarterly option settlement.*** **- KYJELLYTIME69.**

* This is very bullish because after the disclosure of additional buying from Cohen last time, even though it strangely took 1 full trading day for the market to pop up, GME shot up 29%.
* Surprise investors with their holiday sales and/or EPS.
   * *GME will more than likely beat earnings next quarter. I won't go into much detail into this because it is not my expertise, however* u/Uberkikz11 *has done some amazing DD and has been doing so for a long time. This guy literally goes into GameStop stores to get his information. Read this:* [*https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kh9na8/gme\_4q20\_financial\_model/*](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kh9na8/gme_4q20_financial_model/) \- horny131313
* RC Ventures LLC gets more than one seat on the board.
* RC Ventures LLC begins a hostile takeover.
   * On top of its increasing stake, Ryan is supported by both a lot of small and now large investors too.
   * Moreover ‚Äú*there is a decent amount of evidence that Ryan Cohen spent the summer of 2020 hiring a badass lawyer and crafting a pretty solid plan to wrest control of a struggling Mall-based gaming retailer from its out of touch Boomer Board and CEO so he can turn it into an ecommerce juggernaut like his baby Chewy. the attorney listed on each of the 13Ds filed by RC Ventures. \[...\] Chris Davis, Activist Attorney Extraordinaire and His Successful Use of the Consent Solicitation to Remove Dipshit Boards/CEOs‚Äù* \- CPTHubbard.
* Moody's Upgrades GameStop's credit rating a second time in a row
   * *Hoping for a PR soon confirming the recent redemption of the 2021 notes. Potential credit upgrade from Moodys could come now that GME has officially redeemed 63% of their 2021 notes. If we don't get that now, we should get it in March when the entirety of the 2021 notes are retired. Debt considered investment grade and not junk is a big positive and one most overlook.* \- Stonksflyingup
* Short sellers close a part of their position huge short position.
* A major hedge fund takes a significant position on GME.
* Dividend reintroduction.

## 3.2 Downside Risks

* New short sellers open a position and current ones scale up theirs.
* Momentum towards profitability dies out and the company goes bankrupt.
   * Honestly if you read this far you know this is extremely unlikely.
* Share dilution.

## 3.3 Overview

&#x200B;

[Table 6: Upside risks](https://preview.redd.it/e46jey6nc6961.png?width=774&format=png&auto=webp&s=5bdfbdaf27d5caaf93fea0973ff3f114ab875eee)

[Table 7: Downside risks](https://preview.redd.it/085l0xbic6961.png?width=779&format=png&auto=webp&s=97f4fedef4b899b1ad49ed0dceb47144644b85ca)

## 3.4 Commentary

[Figure 12: GME is one of or even THE most shorted stock for its valuation \(in terms of &#37; short interest\).](https://preview.redd.it/ag3sc9q9c6961.png?width=1023&format=png&auto=webp&s=2d55ae8902ba4f3cd3dd4120f698c077b75633ce)

This means two things:

* It is very unlikely for the shorts to continue to short the company especially when its credit rating is being upgraded - we will see if it keeps getting upgraded or not in March.
* If the shorts get to short it more (or new short sellers open a position) it will:
   * Drive the stock price down (lower market cap), drive the short ratio higher making the unwinding of the short sellers even harder and as a result making the probability to have a short-squeeze VERY BIG if good events happen moving forward.
   * Push Ryan Cohen to accelerate its plans.
      * *I will personally increase my share-position if it happens.*

# Conclusion

## 4.1 Prices Targets

Here is a summary of [my post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kow6gs/gme_price_targets_for_2021_according_to_the_short/):

When the short % of free float went from a high point (\~160%) at around February 2020 to a low point (\~140%) - which by the way are in absolute terms both huge numbers- the stock went up \~94% **BUT** most of the gain took place at 2 key moments: at the recovery of the market crash and then in late August which shows that üíéüôå-ing is key to capture most of the gains.

[Figure 13: GME returns from 3 Feb. 2020 to 1 Sept. 2020](https://preview.redd.it/5ysyfz35c6961.png?width=614&format=png&auto=webp&s=541ade007b74cb376a2477c6705c87999c51cdb5)

Why do I say this? Because when holding the stock you could ‚Äúfeel‚Äù like you bled when you watch the stats:

|Positive daily returns|Negative daily returns|
|:-|:-|
|49.3 %|50.7 %|

But IT WAS IN FACT THE SHORT SELLERS WHO BLED HARD:

|Best daily return|Worst daily return|
|:-|:-|
|23.0 %|\-13.7 %|

Imagine you sold GME when the -13.7% happened. You would not have captured the 94% returns. So just üíéüôå and let those shorts go bankrupt.

**FAQ 1 : Is GameStop going bankrupt?**  250%+ yearly growth ecom sales, already closing top \~20% of their most unprofitable locations, high margin partnership with Microsoft, new gaming console generation, Moody's recent credit upgrade...

**FAQ 2 : GameStop employees complain about the company, so is the stock going down?** Well listen to Apple's iPhone manufacturers or Amazon employees... There is no correlation between their words and the stock price.

Positions: shares and cash. I keep cash on the sidelines to buy the dips.

As the self-appointed WSB quant, I took it upon myself to look at 2020 data to find the most extreme consecutive moves up and down for stocks. I'm also going to provide a simple analysis that answers the question "If stock A has been going up for N days already, what's the probability that  it will keep going up in upcoming day(s)?"

First, I define a stock's daily return in a given day as the percentage change in the price from the previous day's close to that day's close.

Second, I limit the analysis only to [Robinhood's 100 most popular stocks](https://robinhood.com/collections/100-most-popular), because that list includes most of the meme/fun stocks.

Third, I only look at April 2020 onward, because after COVID the market has changed significantly and we are still in this new structure.

# Back-to-Back Positive Moves of Any Size üöÄ

Let's first look at consecutive positive moves. I don't care if the daily return was +50% or +0.001%, as long as it's above zero and happens back-to-back, we count it.

The largest streak belongs to TWTR, WKHS, and ZNGA, with 11 days! After that is TSLA, SNE, and G-U-S-H with 10 days.

Here are how often each streak happened across all stocks in the sample. For example, streaks of 6 happened 91 times (3.8%) for the stocks in the sample.

[Upstreaks Frequency](https://preview.redd.it/17bnpyao56961.png?width=402&format=png&auto=webp&s=ba0ce56d1c82305ca93d6e6552ffceb8e5129353)

Now, back to the question: if a stock has had a streak of N days already, what's the chance that it will keep going up the next day(s)? For the more statistically literate, P(X > N | X = N). I use the table above and Bayes rule to answer this question:

[Probabilities of a streak continuing given its current length](https://preview.redd.it/1uu3rmot56961.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=f6a1601ff8260fc1d71e211dd079634da87392b3)

*Of course, these probabilities are for all of the stocks in the sample, and they don't take into account the specific conditions of a stock or the events/rumors/news that might have caused the streak to start.*

&#x200B;

# Back-to-Back Positive Moves of at least 3% üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ

Now let's repeat the above analysis but make it more interesting by focusing only on streaks that involved at least a 3% upside move.

The record here belongs to FCEL, which went up 3%+ for 7 days in a row! During this streak, the price of FCEL went from 2.56 to 8.55!

# Back-to-Back Negative Moves of any size

Now let's look at the unlucky stocks that went down for consecutive days. Here the record-breaker is XOM, with 11 days of going south. Must've felt terrible if you held the stock during that period.

And lastly

# Back-to-Back Negative Moves of At Least 3%

The record here belongs to I-D-E-X, with 6 days in a row of going to hell! During this time, the price fell from 0.97 to 0.68.

I did nothing other than ask a friend who has experience with the company what he thought about them. He has a background and degree related to finance and a MASSIVE amount of knowledge on investing. He‚Äôs a an absolute GOD of DD. He had written this all the way back in OCTOBER. Without further intro, here‚Äôs a bunch of awesome DD. TL;DR: PLTR to the fucking üåù üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ


*Profitability*

Price to sales is high, coming in at 15.63. Compared to some of their competitors (listed below), the average for the industry is below 2. Said differently, investors are paying a high premium for the rapid growth in revenue and the hope that the industry will explode someday. The key questions are will the AI industry expand and how much of this market will be funneled into Palantir, both commercially and from the government. 

Their revenue is growing quickly. Over the past year it has grown 21.27% and over the prior three years it has a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 14.83%.

Cash flow and net income are both negative, but they are improving. Their net income has increased by 20% over the past year and their free cash flow has increased by 64.41%. 

Net profit margins are also still negative, but increased 32.63% over the prior year. One thing about their margins is that they definitely live a lavish life style at their workplace. The food is free, the equipment is expensive, and the amenities are abundant‚Äîhaving observed this, they absolutely attract some of the best employees around. 

A nice segway into the balance sheet is to talk about their accounts receivable (A/R). Their ability to collect money consistently and accurately are impressive, with only $5 million in A/R for this year and only $2 million in A/R last year. 

*Balance Sheet*

The company has a book value of $791.47 million and sells at a P/B of ~21.10. This is high for a traditional value or growth play, but is not absurd for technology companies.

Their current and quick ratio are 2.78 and 2.65, respectively. This is impressive‚Äîfor safety, a rule of thumb I use is a current ratio above 1.5 and a quick ratio above 1. Anything over 2 ensures a high probability of survival during difficult times. Also, the company barely has any money tied up in restricted cash, allowing them to allocate money to working capital more easily and preventing liquidity crises. But it is not as rosy as it seems. I will talk about the preferred securities shortly. 

The company has $1.08 billion in short-term cash and cash equivalents. Their short-term (> 1 year) liabilities are $730 million and their total liabilities are $3.57 billion. The D/E ratio is impressive, hovering around .39. The larger contractors usually have a D/E ratio above 1-1.5, with the exception of Raytheon. 

One thing that is not shown in the D/E ratio is something I mentioned in a prior paragraph, the preferred stock. This is a problem because preferred shares act very similar to debt. They currently have $2.13 billion in preferred shares outstanding, and I am not sure how many of those are convertible. If we add that to the debt, their new D/E ratio is over 2, putting it higher than most defense contractors. 

*Compensation / Dilution*

Currently, the company has $1.6 billion shares outstanding from their direct listing. On top of that, they have approximately 2.17 billion diluted shares. Said differently, if all options and convertible securities are activated, that is the potential number of shares outstanding. For any company this is an extreme amount of dilution and something Warren Buffet warns value investors about. The engineers and executives are highly compensated through their 250 million+ stock option program, as well as the preferred security holders. 

*Insider Selling*

One thing we never like to see is insider selling. The CEO has sold 11% of his stake, or 14.1 million shares, for $135 million. Cofounder Peter Thiel sold even more, ~$365 million. Nonetheless, the CEO still has the majority of his holdings and will be issued more stock if the company reaches goals in the future. This is something I am not too excited about, but it is not a major red flag because it was a small amount and perhaps he just wanted some cash‚Äîhe has been working hard for 17 years awaiting this day. 

*Competitors*

When it comes to direct competitors (contractors that specialize in AI), it appears that Leidos, Raytheon, and FireEye stand out the most. However, looking at the defense contracting industry as a whole, Lockheed, Boeing, General Dynamics, and Northrop Grumman also present threats. Interestingly, there are arguments online that Palantir is extra risky because ~half of their revenue comes from US Government contracts, but this is a common characteristic for many of the defense contractors that I listed above, even Boeing. 

*Valuation*

I will base my valuation on them staying negative cash flow in the coming three years then netting X amount of cash flow for a few scenarios. I can send you the excel document if you want. I will summarize below. My discount rate is 8% (which is high, but conservative) and my growth rate is 7% (which is also somewhat optimistic). 

When it comes to cash flow, I have estimated they will stay negative for three years then slowly work up to $100 million. I will assign different values to their perpetual cash flow after 10 years below keeping the growth rate and discount rate the same. Two major things can happen to mess up the calculations. The growth rate could be higher or lower and the amount of cash flow could be higher or lower.  

Slowly increasing cash flow and perpetually brining in $100 million annually: $10.9 billion
Slowly increasing cash flow and perpetually brining in $150 million annually: $16.263 billion
Slowly increasing cash flow and perpetually brining in $200 million annually: $21.613 billion
Slowly increasing cash flow and perpetually brining in $250 million annually: $26.963 billion
Slowly increasing cash flow and perpetually brining in $300 million annually: $32.213 billion
Slowly increasing cash flow and perpetually brining in $350 million annually: $37.663 billion

It‚Äôs difficult to value a company that is in such an early stage based off cash flow. We have no idea how much cash flow they will bring in, how much the industry will grow, or where interest rates will be. Nonetheless, doing this analysis is sobering and dampens expectations. 

*Other Topics*

Their recruiting and the quality of engineers and computer scientists are similar to that of Tesla. People in the industry know this is a difficult company to work for. Their interviewing process is unique and difficult, usually encompassing a difficult task using their software (i.e. here is a bunch of data; find the terrorist using Gotham). 

Another interesting thing to look at is a top-down, or macro, approach to the industry. 

Here are some interesting points:
1. The US military budget is ~$689.6 billion, and this will likely increase or stay the same in the future
2. AI accounted for ~$4 billion of this budget
3. Cyber security accounted for ~$9.85 billion 
4. Palantir receives approximately half their revenue from government contracts, which is ~$500 million

Let‚Äôs assume that the combined budget for AI and cybersecurity grows to $20 billion ($5 billion higher than it is now) in the future, which I think is reasonable. If Palantir is one of the leaders in this industry and accumulate 5% of that $20 billion budget, that would be $1 billion from government contracts, not including their fast growth in the commercial industry. These numbers are conservative, as I think the allocation for AI and cyber could be closer to $50-$100 billion someday. This is where the opportunity is and the commercial side is just icing on the cake. 

If Palantir becomes the leader and the world trends more to cybersecurity and AI, there is potential to make money. 

Finally, I would like to speak about my personal experience with the company. I have used many intelligence tools, but only two stand out to me. Palantir is one of them and it is a cut above its peers. The beauty, capability, and analysis tools are unmatched. It is user-friendly but I wouldn‚Äôt say anyone on the street could stand up and use it. I am not sure their plans, but they could modify it and use it for so many applications in the business world. This is something I hope they do.


Good luck you retards_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Which brokerage gives the best execution price? I'm trying to compare brokerages based solely on their execution prices. Disregard any other factors of the platforms. Are execution prices through one broker less favorable than another? Will I get a different fill price on Robinhood than I would on TDAmeritrade/Thinkorswim? If so, what's the reasoning for this. Getting paid for order flow isn't sound reasoning, because all the brokers sell their order flow, often to the same entities like Citadel. With that being said, why would one broker actually provide better or worse fill prices? I've been under the impression that Robinhood provides horrible execution prices, but does anyone have any experience to back that and any reasoning other than the fact that they sell their order flow?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ NIO Time to Fly: Coming Monday _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Tomorrow's move, illustrated. _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Nio Launches 'NIO Certified' Used Car Service in China Amid Competitive Pressure From Tesla _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ PLTR GANG RISE UP!!!!!

The other day I was reading the news and saw [this](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.wzzm13.com/amp/article/money/first-stimulus-payment-tax-claim/67-c48b059f-0457-4abe-b00d-3748a01cdf1f). There‚Äôs no rocket or moon emojis so I know none of you will read it. But here‚Äôs the main point: 

> ‚ÄúIf a college student worked in 2020 they're still eligible," said Greene-Lewis. If the student files their taxes independently for 2020, they can use the Recovery Rebate Credit to get up to $1,200. Most students are also not eligible for the second stimulus check, so they can also use the credit next year to get $600.‚Äù

Many of you guys, like me, are claimed as a dependent by your parents‚Äîeven if you‚Äôre basically living on your own as a college student and file your taxes independently. This meant that when stimulus checks were sent out, you didn‚Äôt receive the $1,200 you so desperately wanted to throw at TSLA weeklies. **There‚Äôs a way that you can get what you deserve.**

The Rebate Recovery credit is a tax credit that you can claim if you were a dependent last season. You can file independently this year and claim up to $1,200. Remember this when you file this tax season. And, ya‚Äô know, get back at Mitch a little.

Along with the $3,000 in losses you‚Äôre gonna claim anyways, you can now also claim the stimmy money this tax season. Now, you won‚Äôt be able to pay back that loan your dad gave you; but, throw your tax refund into enough GME calls, and you may be able to return your account to even.

&#x200B;

MT is a heavily traded by the institutions and hence follows institutional structures. They like to target the 125%, 150% and 200% swings of balance areas. See how they target the 2x moves areas in the chart below in the Green boxes.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gzt5snrgx4961.png?width=1846&format=png&auto=webp&s=10b22b0ed8a14505d06b4c9be8cadf11b64f6b83

For the latest swing we have broken above the previous high at 19 and held and has reacted to the 150% extension line. We now know that the institutions and the algos are working off this swing structure. Their target will be in the upper red box around $29- $30.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/8myexzhgy4961.png?width=1330&format=png&auto=webp&s=da2a589e3c5f347a39e312e05d90ec3190d10cf4

Ideally the best place to buy would be in the green box around $19 however if we do a statistical arbitrage analysis of the stock vs the price of steel, I dont think it will go back this far.

This is a chart of MT vs Steel Futures prices. You can see the stock has a close correlation to steel prices and is trading at a significant discount to the price of steel. The last steel price peak of $900 , MT was trading at an average of $30( purple box area). Steel is now at $1000, so the $30 target is very reasonable.

https://preview.redd.it/22msxzrgz4961.png?width=1605&format=png&auto=webp&s=63e0186c50cb91e2e8d03e8bf987cff3ca4eb22c

From current price to $30 is a 30% gain for an initial target. It could blow through this area but I would expect to see some profit taking here and a short term reversal especially if steel prices start to come off. If they dont the institutions will re accumulate for the next leg up.

I will look to buy at 22.20, 21.20 and around 19 if I see the right volumes coming in._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Lionel Hutz teaches Marge about wallstreetbets _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Why did PLTR sell off last week? (An analysis) # Everybody that wanted in, was already in
According to finviz.com, retail investors own 79% of PLTR's float (shares available for trading), suggesting that much of the price increase from $10 to over $30 in the past 3 months was driven by said class of investors. It's unlikely that risk-sensitive institutions would be heavily involved in such a feverish stock. For example, Palantir's market cap increased by more than $10 billion in a couple days after the announcement of a $44 million 3-year partnership with the FDA. $44 million over 3 years is a rounding error relative to its annual revenue.
After hitting its $33 peak, PLTR pulled back and consolidated at a $25 to $29 price range. During this time, people continue to be bullish for the stock with many believing that it'll soon break all-time-highs again. Unfortunately, at least in the short term, everyone that wanted in was already in and the lack of new buying primed the stock for a sell-off. Another way to spot this is when /r/WallStreetBets starts being filled with bullish commentary for the stock. On a few days in November and December, the majority of the subreddit was talking about PLTR. If you think about it, users would only create a bullish post or upvote bullish posts of a stock if they already had a long position.
Once the buying pressure waned, a small amount of selling compounded with other bearish factors discussed below were sufficient to trigger large waves of selling.
# Options market makers selling hedged stocks for sold calls
Options market makers are institutions contracted by an exchange to supply liquidity to the options market, even when there's no willing external buyer or seller. Market makers make money by buying or selling options to traders at slightly worse prices than the actual price, and pocketing the difference. As such, they aren't interested in making a directional bet on a stock's price by being short or long options and whenever you sell or buy an option from them, they need to hedge their position.
Specifically, when a market maker sells a call option to a trader, the market maker needs to hedge by buying the underlying stock. When a market maker buys a call option from a trader, the market maker shorts the underlying stock. Vice versa for puts.
PLTR had a large number of open call positions expiring at year-end. As price fell, most of these options expired worthless and the market makers that sold them had to unwind their hedges. Because market makers buy the underlying stock to hedge against a sold call position, they sell said stock when unwinding the hedge. As large numbers of PLTR's call options expired worthless at year-end, options market makers sold the PLTR they bought as a hedge which contributed to the year-end price decline.
# Institutional funds rebalancing
Even though retail investors own most of Palantir's tradeable shares, institutions do own a non-trivial amount (12% of the float, according to finviz.com) that were mostly acquired during the IPO. These institutions include Morgan Stanley, BlackRock, and Soros Fund Management. Funds have a target ownership percentage for each portfolio stock and when its price increases or decreases dramatically in a short period, the fund needs to rebalance by selling or buying said stock. Rebalancing happens either at a fixed time period or when an imbalance threshold is crossed. Because PLTR's price appreciated so rapidly in just a couple months, it probably fell victim to year-end institutional rebalancing.
# Frontrunning profit-taking in 2021
Because PLTR's price increased so rapidly in 2020, traders are expected to sell in 2021 to defer taxes for one year. It's likely that some traders attempted to get ahead of this expectation by selling a few days before December 30th (trades executed on and after this date settle in 2021). PLTR's price started to fall off a cliff on December 28th and it kept falling until the year's last trading day on December 31st. As such, the selling on the 28th and 29th is partially attributed to traders frontrunning new-year-profit-taking while the selling on the 30th and 31st is new-year-profit-taking.
# Frontrunning the 2021 lock-up period expiry
Palantir's IPO was a direct listing meaning that it only made existing shares sellable on the market. No new shares were created and sold. This means that insiders (founders, employees, and VCs) own most of Palantir's shares. During the IPO, these insiders could only sell 20% of their holdings and the other 80% are locked up until after 2021's first earnings report. Unsurprisingly, traders expect more selling than usual when these shares unlock since 80% is a lot of shares. Long time PLTR holders will want to divest at least some of their holdings.

Technical analysis (using price charts to determine when to buy or sell) is controversial but still popularly used to predict short term price movements. PLTR's chart displayed several sell signals ever since it peaked at $33. For one, the chart has a giant double top with rejections at $33 and $31 on November 27th and December 8th respectively. A double top is a very popular sell signal. Bullish momentum and volume has also waned since the price peak with daily MACD (a technical indicator) becoming bearish on December 10th. Falling momentum is no bueno for a stock driven by momentum.

**Overview**

Fluor is a Fortune 500 Engineering,¬†Procurement and Construction (EPC)¬†company headquartered in Irving Texas.¬† Fluor corporation has approximately 45,000 employees worldwide. The company operates in 6 segments, Energy and Chemicals, Mining and Industrial, Infrastructure and Power, Diversified Services, and Other with one additional segment being reported as discontinued operations.

**Fundamental** **Problems**

Fluor has multitude of issues that have threatened the very survival of the company. These issues have caused the market cap to crater from 8 Billion in 2018 to 2.25 Billion. The most critical problems are summarized below. This is by no means a complete list. For the sake of length, I have omitted some of the less critical issues. We must also note that there may also be other problems lurking as well.

* Improper bidding, cost overruns and restructuring have led Fluor to report a¬†1.5 Billion loss with approximately 300 Million in asset impairments.
* There are 16 loss contracts that have been improperly negotiated and must be completed at zero margin.
* Weakness in oil Demand has led Flours customers to reduce capex spending in the Energy & Chemicals segment which comprises 40% of Fluor‚Äôs¬†revenue.
* Fluor has had major accounting problems which have spawned a SEC & DOJ investigation.

**Liquidity**

Fluor has $2 Billion in cash, $5 Billion in current assets and $7.2 Billion in total assets. This compares to $3.5 Billion of current liabilities with¬†total liabilities of $6.0 Billion. I believe due to Fluor‚Äôs strong cash position they have ample liquidity to meet all their near-term obligations. Furthermore, while substantial I believe their debt is within¬†reasonable ranges. Fluor is selling an equipment rental business to allow them to¬†‚ÄúModestly‚Äù reduce their leverage and raise more cash, further improving liquidity.

**How Fluor Is Addressing Their Problems**

While Fluor‚Äôs issues are critical,¬†I believe that management is successfully addressing these problems.

Fluor‚Äôs improper contract negotiation stems primarily from their Lump Sum contracts. Essentially this mean that Fluor gets paid in a lump sum at the project completion. This is problematic because it means Fluor must wait until completion of the project before being paid. Additionally, any cost overrun or delay is completely absorbed by Fluor. In order to prevent anymore loss contracts from entering their backlog Fluor has stopped negotiating lump sum contracts opting for more traditional contract negotiation approach and thus protecting the future backlog from more loss contracts.(***I misunderstood how Lump Sum Contracts work please see comments for more detail***)

Despite a net loss of 1.5 Billion, Fluor has generated operating cash flow of $219 Million with Free Cash Flow of $38 Million. This operating cash flow will continue to give Fluor a buffer to complete their loss projects while even increasing their cash balance. As Fluor finishes these projects their operating cash flow and free cash flow will continue to climb higher.

The weakness in revenue for Energy and Chemicals should also begin to slow as some EPC work for regular Maintenance is necessary to maintain oil and gas infrastructure. Furthermore,¬†if emission standards become stricter this could spur demand as refineries increase CAPEX to upgrade their facilities. Finally, I expect the chemicals portion of this business to continue to drive adequate performance as we do not have any viable alternatives to Petro-Chemicals yet.

On the accounting side Fluor has unfortunately discovered that there were problems with their¬†Internal Financial¬†Controls and revenue recognition. These issues have been corrected but I think it is safe to assume that Fluor has significant liability with potential SEC & DOJ lawsuits.¬†However,¬†despite this I believe the lawsuits, while expensive, likely will take years to resolve and considering Fluor‚Äôs strong cash position they¬†will most likely will be able to pay the fine.

**Impact of Reasonable Adverse Development's on Fluor's business**

In order to establish Safety of principal we must consider a few possible adverse conditions that can arise and the impact on Fluor's business.¬†

* More loss contracts, This would be a very poor outcome for Fluor but I believe that even with more loss contracts Fluor would still generate enough cash to meet all their¬†obligations. in a worst case scenario Management could also continue to sell more assets in order to raise more capital to fund the loss contracts.
* Major Global Economic Recession, This would be mostly bad for Fluor but its possible they could actually benefit from fiscal stimulus and projects designed to spur demand in the Economy.  They also have a backlog of projects so a major drop in (edit: profitability) wouldn't immediately occur in a recession. Rather they would have a little bit of time to figure out what to do.
* Prolonged Depressed Oil Prices, This is a pretty likely scenario thankfully Fluor has expertise in many different industries and can continue to drive growth in these areas. While¬†over exposed at the moment they are not solely dependent on Oil and Gas.

**Major Growth Opportunities**

These ideas below are the most exciting and compelling reason to look at investing in Fluor.

Fluor‚Äôs Mining & Industrial segment constructs & maintains mines globally. As demand for precious metals increase due to a transition away from fossil fuels, precious metals for batteries could take the place of Oil. This includes lithium, nickel and cobalt Fluor has prior experience with these materials. Mining already comprises about 35% of their revenue and has been profitable and a major pillar of stability in Fluor's business. (Although Covid has Delayed some new contract awards in this segment)

Fluor‚Äôs Energy & Chemicals Business has built off shore wind farms, carbon capture, bio-fuels and hydrogen infrastructure. All infrastructure currently being looked at to mitigate or solve the climate change crisis. This area will be competitive but Fluor does have its own IP it can bring to the table and compete with. If there is a major jump in demand in the coming years Fluor is certainly capable of winning some construction work in these areas.

Some other miscellaneous things Fluor engages in is nuclear decommissioning, managing the U.S strategic oil reserve, Building automobile & Pharmaceutical factories and Data center construction.

And then there is the crown jewel¬†NuScale, a company planning on building the First small modular nuclear reactor (SMR) in the United States. Fluor is the Majority investor in NuScale and is the exclusive EPC contractor for NuScale. Recently the U.S Nuclear Regulatory Commission certified NuScale‚Äôs one-of-a-kind design. The U.S Department of Energy has also awarded NuScale‚Äôs¬†first customer $1.3 Billion in cost sharing to build the first reactor Idaho. Interestingly the United States International Development Finance Corp also lifted a ban for the financing of nuclear projects and has also signed a letter of intent to support NuScale. This will likely be a $1 Billion dollar loan South Africa in order to build a NuScale SMR . There are many other interested parties both inside and outside the U.S including Canada, Romania and the Czech Republic. The applications of this technology are wide ranging. Electricity production is a primary use, however other uses include desalination for clean drinking water and using the excess heat produced by the reactor to create cheap carbon free hydrogen.

**Basis for Investment**

In the near term I believe Fluor can successfully complete a turnaround restoring most of their business segments back to reasonable profitability. In 2017 Fluor generated 318 Million in Free Cash Flow. Assuming Fluor completes their restructuring and finishes the loss contracts I see no reason why Fluor cannot return to at least 250 million in annual free cash flow. This FCF is 11% of Fluor's Total market cap and by itself presents a very attractive return for an investor. Simultaneously Fluor‚Äôs should be able to shift their construction focus away from oil and gas to new¬†areas that are growing increasingly important. The low barriers to entry are both a blessing and curse in this regard. That brings me to NuScale which oddly seems as though it‚Äôs being adopted by the U.S government as some strange foreign policy play. While it remains a longshot in my view the combination of the DOE grant and the potential DFC loan is 2.3 billion a big positive. This is equivalent to the entire market cap of Fluor and shows the scale of the opportunity. Furthermore, Fluor currently has no competitors in this market so margins should be significantly higher. I believe Fluor will complete a successful turnaround likely bringing the stock back to 4 Billion and restoring the dividend. In the Long-term the company could even hit new all-time highs however I‚Äôm not entirely confident on putting an exact figure on that just yet.

&#x200B;

TLDR: Fluor is struggling construction company, but I think the company can pull off a successful turnaround. That coupled with expanding their existing non-oil revenue and the NuScale wild card could send the stock from $16 to at least $30 and possibly beyond $80 (its all time high) since its a very compelling growth story. also FLR to the moon

**A Value-Based A.I. Investment**  

&#x200B;

In the era of growing small businesses and increasing brand presence, the internet appears to be a vast and difficult space to make a lasting impression on from a small business perspective. Small businesses may have insufficient entries in Google, Yahoo, and other search engines, where clients are likely to discover them. This is significant for these businesses, because if their information is inaccurate or missing, it will turn away potential customers. Yext, a growing New York based company under the ticker YEXT, provides a solution for modifying these entries and increasing the internet presence of small businesses.  YEXT shows promise as a growing long term stock due to its unique product line and hopeful financials.

In a sense, Yext is like Google but for enterprises that require more depth than Google can provide for them, and they actually use Google to help companies advertise and gain traction with consumer base using their APIs that are integrated with consumer platforms. The advertising industry is huge, as we‚Äôve seen Google, Facebook, and Snapchat dominate simply off reaching consumers, and collecting their data. Yext bridges the gap between businesses and unstructured data of potential consumers and existing consumers, setting them up in a multi-billion dollar industry expected to continually increase for the future. 

Their main product line includes Answers: a search engine, Listings: an advertising tool to get your company‚Äôs products onto multiple platforms, Pages: a tool that helps get your business at the top of every location search, Reviews: which helps you engage with customer feedback, and Knowledge Graph/Analytics which helps business owners see their customer interactions with their webpages and other online presence. Websites used to be everything for a business but now a business requires presence across multiple platforms and integration with every search engine, map, or social media. The more a business‚Äô online presence is spread the more analytics you need too, and Yext is the amalgamation of the entire business‚Äô internet presence. This cloud-based software is easy to use, and it‚Äôs used by several reputable companies; including huge fast food chains, travel companies, car manufacturers and even banks. 

Yext solves the problem of particular consumer questions and connects the respective business with precisely what the consumer was looking for. Specific questions such as ‚Äúwealth advisor near me who specializes in healthcare‚Äù (an example they used in their past annual report) will become increasingly easier to answer with the newest developments in Artificial Intelligence. The control of the ever-changing facts of a business are what enable it to spread its sales. Up-to-date and relevant information on every nook and cranny of the web has become a necessity, as convenience has become the most necessary commodity. Poor site experience is a huge detractor for the large majority of shoppers, and if businesses are able to retain this potential loss in customers they‚Äôd be willing to pay anything. Managing an online presence using one dashboard is going to be a very desirable service for all businesses, regardless of size. Yext links all the chains together in the cloud, for Google Assistant, Alexa, Siri, and even the Chinese WeChat, all services which are improving more and more in terms of their search capabilities and they‚Äôre growing in popularity.

&#x200B;

The product or service a company provides is the most crucial aspect of a company‚Äôs success, and YEXT seems to deliver on its product. The solution requires a subscription that can be priced according to a business‚Äô specific needs. YEXT does not seem to have as many recognizable competitors. Its main competitors, Birdeye and Chatmeter, are both private companies with no real news about an IPO anytime soon, while YEXT has been public on the NYSE for three years. From this perspective, YEXT maintains an advantage over its competitors due to it being more recognizable and financially stronger due to its valuation reaching over a billion after going public. However, a reported issue with the product is that listings may go back to normal after a contract with a small business terminates. This is justifiable, because a small business could use the service for a month and reap all benefits. To improve this aspect of the solution that is controversial, maybe a potential solution could be negotiating a minimum period the contract has to be active in order for listings not to revert when it is terminated. Despite this drawback, Yext Inc. has innovated in this niche field and is emerging as a frontrunner in back-end listing modification.

Now that we have established that YEXT will likely be a frontrunner in structuring advertising data, we need to establish WHY this is a growing industry, as YEXT is heavily dependent on the growth of eCommerce and other forms of online and in person business. Without businesses, Yext will have no source of revenue so the expansion of commerce is critical to Yext‚Äôs revenue. Fortunately, eCommerce and small businesses are trending upwards, indicating a healthy future for YEXT. One way to examine if this industry is growing is to analyze advertisement spending, as more online businesses directly correlates to more money spent on advertising. The graph below regarding digital advertising spending clearly illustrates that online business is growing, with advertisement spending nearly doubling over the six years.

&#x200B;

Another way to gauge the health of the industry YEXT is heavily dependent on is to take a look at the growing amount of transactions online. Transactions correlate to greater revenue generated via the internet and thus a greater need for YEXT to introduce smaller businesses to this growing market. The chart below from Statista portrays the growth of Mobile POS payments and Digital commerce over seven years, almost tripling in total volume. 

&#x200B;

Once again this looks promising for YEXT, as their clients are primarily located in this sect of online business due to accurate data going hand in hand with more online sales. Furthermore, YEXT will be a solid pick for investors in the long term due to its growth along with a growing industry and its solid product. If you are interested in delving deeper into why eCommerce and online payments are growing, be sure to check out the Paypal/Square DD as well.

On their last 10k, Yext reported the following for their most recent compiled income statement:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/f8renwobw1961.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=d66290b3c437c25c5798b9130d55f3fdbbd25470

As you can see for the top line, there are plenty of positive signs. Revenue has grown by over $50M yearly from 2016 to 2019, and from 2019 to 2020 revenues grew by about $70M. So the indicator when it comes to sales is overwhelmingly signaling that this company is well-positioned to grow, especially in the near future. Gross profit margins are also great as the cost of the product itself isn‚Äôt much. The potential issues in the income statement show up as you go toward the bottom line. Operating expenses far outweigh gross profits so net profits are -30% despite gross profit margins being 75%. Breaking down Opex, you can see that about ‚Öî of them go towards sales and marketing, which isn‚Äôt necessarily a bad thing as distributing your product can be a huge future investment, but it can be concerning for investors who want a product that ‚Äúsells itself‚Äù. Despite this rather arbitrary requirement, the sales growth justifies the spending as it‚Äôs obviously working and eventually revenue should far outpace selling expenses. 

In their 10k, they state that their sales expenses primarily had to do with more wages and a higher headcount of employees. As the company‚Äôs operations grow, they‚Äôll need more employees to run it in an aggressive growth stage. Despite the constant revenue growth, the stock price has been diluted due to more underwriting in 2019. It may take a while to recover from all the extra supply that was brought into the market, but even if we see more financing in early stages, I personally wouldn‚Äôt be concerned as that‚Äôs a normal course of action for younger companies.

A quick look at the financials indicates that YEXT is improving as a company over each year. Due to their relatively high amounts of investment, the EPS for the company has remained negative. The EPS was also a lot worse in previous years. However, don‚Äôt let this negative metric fool you, as the EPS has been trending positive since the first quarter of 2020. This indicates significant improvement, especially since the EPS hasn‚Äôt been improving much prior to 2020. The increase of the EPS is also supported by the increase of change in working capital from $2M to $4M. As for the rest of the cash flow statement, the negative values are primarily caused by the expansion of operations. This expansion of operations is indicated by the increasing total assets, which means that YEXT grew their assets via larger operations. Although the numbers may be negative temporarily, the expansion of operations allows YEXT to generate more revenue from operations and hopefully turn the direction of cash flows around. Constant reinvestment back into the company is a good sign as it indicates owner and shareholder confidence in the future prospect.

Finally, delving into the 10Q provides reassuring prospects for the future health and growth of YEXT as a company. Looking at the breakdown of individual risks, YEXT looks to be relatively secure in the future. The main risks of the company are internal, and are not influenced by factors such as inflation and foreign currency fluctuations. To some, YEXT may appear risky due to its limited financial history and potential unprofitability due to it being relatively new. However, these risks will ultimately be insignificant, as the expansion of operations will soon be recovered by profits if YEXT maintains its current scale of growth that it has achieved in 2020.

In conclusion, YEXT will be a good pickup for many investors because the enterprise solutions industry overall has done very well, and Yext‚Äôs solutions are definitely a foray into the future of artificial intelligence combined with traditional SaaS. If you compare Yext to another company that has a similar premise, Twilio, you can see that Yext‚Äôs price/sales ratio is only 1/7th of Twilio‚Äôs. Of course, Twilio is far more overvalued and has had better sales growth than Yext this past year, but Yext isn‚Äôt a slouch in sales growth either as we‚Äôve seen. Plus, they have far more potential than Twilio does as we‚Äôve seen with their relatively small market cap of $2B. Both companies offer AI-based enterprise solutions, but Yext is just as good if not a better solution for the future as it has more applicability through a variety of businesses. If you want to see similar growth to what we‚Äôve seen in company‚Äôs such as Twilio but feel as if you‚Äôve missed the bus, don‚Äôt worry: we‚Äôve got the pick for you. Yext is still 25% off its 52-wk high, and they are sure to surpass it with just one or two blowout positive ERs which will be in the books soon._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ I‚Äôm ready for some 2021 tendies _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Monday shit storm? _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ This past month has been a Whole Lotta Red for my fellow Palantards crying Palantears _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ GME Infinity War With Melvin Capital & Co.

The actions will also "greatly weaken all parties' confidence in the U.S. capital market," the statement said_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ E2open: Hugely undervalued AI/Cloud SaaS used by Microsoft, Google, AMD, Boeing, etc. Merging in early Q1 In early Q1 P-C-P-L is merging with E2open. E2open has disruptive AI / Cloud technology for the supply-chain industry. They are widely used by big name customers including Google, Microsoft, Boeing, Walmart, Coca Cola, UPS, AMD, NVIDIA, Abbott, and dozens of others.

What differentiates them from other (more boring) supply chain management companies is the way they use AI to predict changes in supply and demand. Basically, E2open allows companies to see 10 steps ahead into the future to forecast how much inventory they will need based on hundreds of variables (geopolitics, resource availability, etc). This saves companies hundreds of millions in waste. CEO Michael Farlekas  compares it to working at a lemonade stand and being able to know ahead of time exactly how many lemons you will need. Obviously this will save you from wasting money on lemons that would spoil. E2open is the only company that integrates this type of AI technology with a vast data Cloud network.

E2open uses a subscription model to make consistent sustainable revenue from their 1000+ customers. There are multiple services they offfer, but over 50% of their customers only use 1 service. What's nice is that existing customers go on to utilize more and more of their services as they realize the value it adds to their companies. Google for example paid E2open twice as much over the course of 2 years. E2open makes additional revenue from new customers, and also by strategic value-adding acquisitions. The SPAC deal is allowing E2open to clean up their balance sheet so they can add value to their software portfolio (and charge higher premiums to existing customers) and continue making acquisitions.

E2open has been growing at a rapid clip since they were taken private in 2015. In 2015 they made $80M in revenue and in 2020 they made $335M. That's 420% growth in 5 years, or roughly +84% growth per year.

In the last 5 years they increased their revenue +420% by value-adding acquisitions they've made over the last decade --- Icon (2013), Serus Corp (2014), Terra Technology (2016), Orchestro (2016), Steelwedge (2017), Zyme (2017), Entomo and Birch Worldwide (2018), Inttra (2018), and Amber Road (2018) --- and integrating these different services to create a beautiful comprehensive end-to-end platform.

Somewhat surprisingly, their projections for 2021 are much lower at only +10% estimated revenue growth, which is the main reason most would argue P-C-P-L is trading so close to the NAV. However, 10% growth is actually really solid when you look at their margins and consider that 80% of their revenue is recurring with excellent customer retention. Institutional investors especially will appreciate E2open as the reliable revenue generating machine that it has  become. 

I'm also still optimistic about valuing E2open as a growth stock and feel the 10% is a low-ball estimate based on comparisons to the median growth of other supply chain management companies. I'm suspecting E2open will consistently  outperform expectations on a quarterly as the SPAC capital equips them to capitalize on their services, continue making acquisitions, and ultimately tap into millions in white space opportunity.

Even if E2open maintained a 10% growth rate  and if this were factored into its valuation, $11/share is still too damn low. E2open compares itself to Descartes, Kinaxis, Manhattan, and Spscommerce. With a median of 10.7x revenue, E2 was only at 7x, and with a median of 34.7x, E2 was only at 21.3x, meaning E2open has a much higher upside than its peers.

Institutions will bring the stock price up to par with it's peers and I believe the low ball projected growth is a conservative number that they will completely destroy when you consider their growth of +400% over the last 5 years. While 10% is perfectly fine for a company like E2open, I'm expecting the trend of the last 5 years to continue in 2021 and we'll be seeing some exciting numbers.

Back at it with an update from my post a few weeks ago. Been following the GA Runoff day in and day out. Been backing up the truck with 126 TLRY Calls to $15 expiring in March, and still adding.

Here‚Äôs what I got:

-Voter turnout has been great and demographics strongly favor a democratic win, for now. Early/absentee votes shattered the old runoff record in GA; so far over 3m votes have been cast (record is 2.1m votes TOTAL.)

-Over 100k new votes have been cast, there‚Äôs a huge young registrant vote, and 38% of all registered voters in GA have voted.

-Dems have out-raised Republicans about 2:1.

-Polls favor a Democratic victory, but polls usually lean left. What‚Äôs interest is that the betting odds have shifted more in favor of Democrats, yet Republicans are still the favorite as the probability of Democrats taking both seats is a harder feat by the numbers.

-Lastly, Trumps rhetoric about voter fraud and rigged elections, etc. is damaging for Republican turnout, most notably his supporters which Loeffler and Perdue need to secure the Senate. Monday‚Äôs rally will either uplift Republican voters to get out and vote or deal the final blow to the party. Trump has even attacked both Republican candidates as well as other GA Republican State officials repeatedly for several issues from the stimulus checks to competence in handling the vote count amongst other things. There‚Äôs speculation by a faction of Republicans that Trump is purposefully sabotaging the race, to send a message to Republicans that without him they are nothing.

Anyways keep an eye out. I think that if voter turnout can stay around 4m then Dems have a really good chance to pull this off. The more votes that come through on Election Day, the higher the chance for Republican control of the Senate.

I‚Äôm willing to take my chances here.

1. **I didn't write this.** Everything below has been copied and pasted from [Chris Bloomstran](https://twitter.com/ChrisBloomstran/status/1345155266468306944)'s Twitter feed, which has trended for the past day. All I've added are a few edits for brevity. If you have a Twitter account, definitely give him a follow. I'm posting this here because I know not all of us are active on Twitter and some might appreciate the read.
2. "**OP is a gay bear."** Full disclaimer, I neither own puts nor am short Tesla (although I'm definitely considering it). In fact, I think Tesla is a fantastic company; if they were cheaper I would almost definitely be long. I'm posting this because, beneath all of the memes and shitposting, I know that all of us want to make money. Every little bit of information/analysis helps, even if we disagree with the end-conclusion.
3. **"Post is too long. Ban."** This post isn't meant for you, please move along. I know it's wordy and there aren't any pictures, but this is meant for those in this sub who enjoy a bit of reading/research. If you aren't interested in a bit of reading, please scroll past.

**A single prediction for the New Year.**

Those unfamiliar with the Federal Reserve Board‚Äôs Regulation T will hear lots about it during 2021. The rule limits the percentage of an investment in equity securities that can be borrowed with a margin loan. A wake-up call is scheduled...

It was widely reported this week that total margin debt reached a new high of $722B. The WSJ‚Äôs 12/28 lead Business and Finance story profiled a $TSLA retail investor, a civil engineer, who had parlayed a $23k option investment in $TSLA into a $2m position. Oh boy. The gentleman is to surely and genuinely be commended for the investment. An 87x gain in a short period is extraordinary (I've never done that, nor will I). That said, a quick perusal of $TSLA twitter commentary and recommendations is terrifying.

One can read the Journal article, [Investors Double Down on Stocks, Pushing Margin Debt to Record TSLA](https://www.wsj.com/articles/investors-double-down-on-stocks-pushing-margin-debt-to-record-11609077600), and draw two conclusions. One, ‚ÄúThis must be extremely dangerous,‚Äù or two, ‚ÄúSurely I can get rich quick too.‚Äù Human nature being what it is‚Ä¶ For the latter, the civil engineer offers this advice on his Twitter page, ‚ÄúIf you have no Tesla call options, you may want to do the math and consider using LEAPS as a way to accelerate your accumulation of Tesla stock. 40X in 2020. Another 50X by 2025.‚Äù Whoa.

*A* series of Q&A tweets ensues (thanks for the heads up [@RomanRubinstein](https://twitter.com/romanrubinstein?lang=en)) on which broker/dealers offer the most margin, the lowest interest rate on margin debt, and how to borrow the most money and obtain the maximum leverage by purchasing call options. ‚ÄúMaintain margin value of 50% in my portfolio and the margin borrowing rides forever,‚Äù goes the advice. Please consider the danger of heeding this advice. The engineer should risk-off and live a happy life.

A whole bunch of people are going to lose a whole bunch of money.

Reading through a series of tweets among the Tesla (and others) option crowd, you see little, if any, mention of maintenance margin requirements. FINRA requires investors, strike that, speculators, to maintain equity of at least 25% of the value of an account. Leverage kills. Maintenance rates can be set above the minimum threshold. The concept of posting shares in stocks like $TSLA, $TWTR, or any established company trading for 20x or 30x sales & borrowing half of the value and then buying calls on the same shares posted as collateral is insanity. The only ‚Äúmath‚Äù a speculator should be doing is knowing at what price against the shares in the account will new equity be required. Most brokers don‚Äôt wait around for a customer to come up with new cash or securities to deposit. What do they do?

They sell down your shares to get to equity compliance. More decline? More forced selling. Depending on maintenance margin thresholds, you can lose it all in a hurry. Red flags are abundant, beyond simply the new record high in total margin and credit market debt outstanding. You can see the bubble in the number of single-contract call options outstanding, in the number of new retail accounts being opened with margin and allowed option trading, and even in the tone of surety by speculators regarding prospects for wildly expensive shares like Tesla.

I never thought I‚Äôd again see the kind of mania like we saw in the late 1990‚Äôs, but here we are. Memories of what can and is likely to happen are long gone. Even a number of professional investors have suspended price as a key determinant of value.  A respected and well-known retired professional investor suggested on Twitter recently that I don‚Äôt understand ‚Äú$TSLA growth math or basic investment theory,‚Äù that ‚Äústocks look forward, not backward‚Äù and that ‚ÄúP/E‚Äôs are a function of exponential growth rates, not industry.‚Äù

The last time an investment pro came unglued was January 2000 at a newspaper roundtable. The C.I.O/PM for one of the largest & oldest growth & income funds at the time took exception to the notion that $MSFT shareholders would lose money for the next 15 years, which they did. I‚Äôd written 6 pages on the prediction in my 1/1/2000 letter (on the website) and discussed it at the roundtable. My co-panelist became unhinged because he and his firm had 5% of capital in $MSFT, which was then a $620B market cap on $20B in sales, 31x sales & 80x earnings.

You can apply the same logic to $TSLA or to any number of dangerously overvalued fashionable disruptive growers today. The Tesla bull proffering margined purchase of $TSLA LEAPS expects a $1,000 share price this year, $5,000 the next and $22,000 by 2025.

Now, a $22,000 stock price, assuming no further dilution above today‚Äôs 1.1B fully diluted shares outstanding, gets you to a $24 trillion market value, which must be reasonable given that the entire market value of the S&P 500 today is only \~$31 trillion & global GDP is $88T. When your TAM (the new eyeballs) is 100% global auto market share, robotaxi, energy grid, insurance and economic population of Mars, no price is too high. No argument that Tesla has made great strides in manufacturing efficiency and are now producing a more reliable product.

I also believe disruption of the auto industry will require an enormous amount of capital to grow and the established OEM‚Äôs won‚Äôt play dead. You can't simply separate auto margins and capital requirements from nearly infinite profitability earned by selling software upgrades. Shouldn‚Äôt the upgrades be considered part of total vehicle cost? To what extent did the Apples and Microsofts of the world thrive on a regular upgrade cycle, much of which was and is planned. How often are you compelled into a new iPhone or iPad? Prior to the subscription model, at what point did Microsoft not support an older operating system or Office suite? Will EV buyers purchase a new car every 2-3 years? How much of the world can afford a more expensive vehicle than the current global average car price?

Regardless of one's beliefs on business quality & growth prospects, paying a too-high price can destroy future investment return. #neversell? When price becomes ridiculous to the most optimistic business case you #bettersell. Price matters and the current environment is nuts. The current folly for price not mattering, or being justifiably high, reminds me of a well known sell-side report on Berkshire Hathaway in 1998 which assumed as undervalued both $BRK‚Äôs shares and its stock portfolio against an assumed ‚Äúreasonable‚Äù 40x market multiple.

Berkshire‚Äôs shares, expensive, would fall by half over the next 18 months to a February 2000 low. It‚Äôs become fashionable to explain investment process by saying price is the last consideration. Too often lately, price isn‚Äôt even a consideration, especially for holy growers. While I did not have a short position on $MSFT in 2000, I do have a very small recent short on Tesla today so take my comments w/ a grain of salt. I did buy $MSFT in '06 after it fell by \~75% and owned it for a decade, trimming when dear and adding to the position when cheap.

*S*hort selling is very risky and those w/ sizable short positions on Tesla at the outset of 2020 would have suffered real damage given the 720% advance during the year. I've read that shorts lost $38B during '20 alone on their collective positions & short interest is way down. I happen to think the valuation is now so large to protect against a continued runaway price, particularly now that u/elonmusk secured its entry in the S&P 500 by engineering 4 quarters of profits by cutting R&D, SG&A and thanks to environmental credits courtesy $GM & $FCA.

Still, I‚Äôd never employ a large short position given unlimited downside and a max return of 100%. Margin is required against short positions. What appears to be a growing army of retail option traders, many employing sizable margin debt, is a recipe for disaster. Price and quality conscious investors get uncomfortable at times like these. I am extremely uncomfortable. I hope those that have no idea what they are doing heed growing and now very high risk and fully understand downside and what margin calls and maintenance margin mean.

Many, many speculators will lose much and even all of their money at some point as this bubble breaks. Now is the time to reduce risk. You could feel badly for employees that were paid in non-qualified stock options and kept their shares upon exercise in the late 1990‚Äôs. When shares plummeted in the wake of the tech bubble the tax liability due on gain realized as income upon exercise was still due and payable, despite shares that were way below the exercise price. It was bad. Many lost everything but weren‚Äôt in a position to understand risk.

Borrowing against Tesla (or any) shares and buying call options presents serious deliberately assumed risk. For perspective, a 92% decline takes the shares back to where they started 2020! With margin, it will take way less than a 92% decline to introduce wipeout.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

***Responding to the PM who claims that the $TSLA price target of $1,200, total EV adoption of 20%, and 5% market share in global auto-manufacturing is reasonable, Bloomstran had this to say:***

You have EV adoption rising from 3% to 20% in five years, a 6x increase (46% CAGR) and Tesla market share at 25%. 2019 global new vehicle sales totaled \~95m units and will be way lower this year. Let's call 2020 a throwaway for the industry, and hats off to [$TSLA](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24TSLA&src=cashtag_click) for growing. From the 2019 base, if we assume 4% market growth then new global units in 2025 would be 115m and at your expected 20% share Tesla would sell 29 million vehicles. Is this your assumption? Sounds aggressive given Tesla‚Äôs 500k unit run rate for 2020 and 1/2% market share.

Now, US new vehicle prices are $38k but significantly lower worldwide, let‚Äôs say $30k per vehicle sold globally. The average Tesla looks to range from high $30k‚Äôs for the Model 3 to $55k for the Model 3 Performance to $125k for the Model X Performance fully loaded.  What do you expect for an average selling price for Tesla in 2025? I‚Äôd presume that as market share expands ASP‚Äôs will have to fall to affordable. I‚Äôm trying to get to a revenue number.

Perhaps the governments of the world will be giving $2k per person, $8k per family of 4 in annual perpetuity, surely making new cars more affordable! If Tesla sells 29m units in 2025 @ $34.5k per unit, that gets sales to $1 trillion, a CAGR of \~102% for five years. Reasonable?

Moving on, you have a 2025 EPS target of $24/share. On how many shares shall we apply your expected per-share figure? Shares outstanding at 9/30 totaled 948m, up from 905m at yearend 2019. An additional $5B in shares were sold recently to the public in ‚Äúat-the-market‚Äù sales.  The sales were done with no roadshow, risk disclosure or prospectus, unless Goldman‚Äôs report upgrading the shares from neutral to buy & a new price target of $780, up from $455, issued days before the announced sale and Goldman‚Äôs retention as selling agent, as a ‚Äúprospectus."

If the shares were sold at an average of \~$600/share, the share count would now be 8.3m shares higher, so call the total 956m. You have a price target of $1,200 for the shares, so let‚Äôs not forget to include in the count any option and RSU shares issued but not yet exercised.  Recall, [*@elonmusk*](https://twitter.com/elonmusk) was granted 20m option shares (now 100m thanks to the split) in 2018 by [*@larryellison*](https://twitter.com/larryellison) and Elon‚Äôs associates on the board. Fully diluted shares total 1.113B right now, and if the stock keeps rising we can assume all options will be exercised and outstanding.

So, how many shares should we apply to your $24 EPS target? If we assume zero further dilution (realistic?), then using the 1.113B fully diluted shares including the recent $5b sale, we get to $26.7B in net income. On an even $1 trillion in revenues, that‚Äôs a 2.67% profit margin, just a bit higher than the auto industry average of 3% and approaching $MSFT‚Äôs 30%.

One last missing piece of information, which I haven‚Äôt seen mentioned by the Tesla bulls or in your message to me is how much capital will be required to grow sales from 500k units to 29m over the next 5 years?  It looks like over the history of [$TSLA](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24TSLA&src=cashtag_click) the company has raised $26.5B in equity capital (including the recent $5B) and $16.5B in debt and preferred equity, so a total of $43B. Tesla has a cumulative loss of $5.7B, so it hasn‚Äôt produced a positive return on capital.

For its last 4 quarters GAAP profits totaled $556M, which yields a 2.5% return on capital (equity net of retained losses plus debt minus cash, all adjusted for the recent $5B sale). I fully understand companies can surely lose money or earn little profit as they scale.  With the recent sale of $5B Tesla now has \~$20B in cash. Is this sufficient to finance its growth over the next 5 years as the company grows units by 102% per year?

Since I don‚Äôt lean on brevity and given my lack of understanding of basic investment theory, let‚Äôs summarize the missing data points necessary to get the stock to your target of $1,200 per share, 50 times your 2025 EPS target of $24 per share. Needed: 1) Tesla unit sales in 2025? 2) Average selling price per unit? 3) Any non-auto related sales ‚Äì insurance, robotaxi, insurance, energy sales? 4) Shares outstanding? 5) Total capital: Additional paid in capital, debt, preferred equity, cash?

At your 50x $24 EPS $1,200  price target, [$TSLA](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24TSLA&src=cashtag_click) returns 11.2% pa from Thursday‚Äôs $705.67 close. I happen to think shares in [$BRK](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24BRK&src=cashtag_click), my largest holding, are likely to compound at roughly that rate, assuming a 10% ROE and a terminal price at 1.3x book value, up from \~1.2x today._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Bloomberg Getting In On Our Lingo _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ DIS: Moon Mission 2021 **Prediction: DIS may soon surpass 200 at early 2021, and potentially to trade between 250--300 this year. How fast it rises will depend on streaming growth. If the subscription continues to add 20M per Q, it will be the next $420 / 1T company within 1-2 years.**

&#x200B;

As a long-time bagholder of TSLA (disclaimer: not any more), DIS in 2020 reminds me a lot of TSLA in 2019: Stock went down big-time during Q1 due to impacted business; slowly recovered throughout the year, then quickly ATH at year-end due to future growth (TSLA last Q4 for improved delivery and cybertruck event; DIS this Q4 bc streaming growth and investor day).

Bears argue the park business is down, a lack of new contents on Disney +, and stock overvalued on current revenue. Bulls believe the pent-up park demand, a sea of new contents coming to Disney +, and potentialy hyper growth in streaming revenue. It is strikingly similar to the debates around TSLA for years (and in fact many growth stocks). And bears lost huge because investors love growth at end of the day.

This year there will be >10 Disney movies on Disney + premiere access in 2021, vs just Mulan in 2020, plus many other TV series and movies only on Disney +. Given DIS's superior brands, top cultural influence, and unrivalled quality, if streaming growth is able to break into 200M-300M subscribers in 1-2 years, there will be huge profit and cash & DIS will break 1T at that point.

&#x200B;

Going forward, every ER they update the subscription number, it may boost the stock price. **The stock currently has many short-term catalysts for the next ER:**

1. At 35% capacity, Disney FL Parks are extremely full. It regularly hits capacity since November, is all sold out for New Year Eve. And China Park has been open and on fire for the whole quarter. This is a strong signal for park's pent up demand, and bodes well for DIS revenue in Q4.
2. Soul turns out to be an unexpected success, and is globally acclaimed. Not really a kids movie, but widely praised and may become an Oscar winner. Box-office wise, it has grossed over USD 20M in China in a week, gaining more and more popularity despite zero ads in China  (10M in past two days alone), and is expected to gross 60M-100M in China at least.
3. With Mando last two episodes, Soul, and Mulan all appearing on Disney + for free during December (especially they are on Disney + after 12.2, the cut-off date for the 86.8M subscriber disclosed on DIS investor day), **I estimae that Disney + shall have a subscriber count of 90M--100M as of end of 2020**. Any number within the range is bullish --- if they can hit close to 95M--100M, it will be perceived as a monumental success (imagine >10M subscriber for one month only!), showing investors the big power of Disney brand, and may immediately rocket the stock to 250.
4. With increased park revenue and Disney + growth in this Q, DIS has a good chance to beat Q4 estimates for revenue and profit (based on Yahoo finance). And they have beat twice in past two Q.

It does not mean the stock has no risk, if the streaming growth slows down in a material way, or Macro uncertainty rises again, then stock will certainty react negatively.

Strategy-wise, do stocks or leaps --- stocks will double, and leaps have a chance to triple or more at current streaming growth. I personally hold 2022 and 2023 leaps. No weeklies --- if the stock is no higher than 200 at early Feb, and no change in Macro prospect then, it may worth a small try on ER calls then.

Feel free to short the stock --- imagine betting against a strong growth story, the most iconic company, a kids-favorite brand, the best animation studio, the legend of galaxy, and all the superheroes --- it is as bad as betting against Elon, if not more so (yet throughout 2019, many bet against Elon)._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ PLTR most important software company in the world This is easy fucktards, so listen up.

Just watched a short clip on CNBC which was explaining why a bunch of IPO stocks were down in the final week of trading for 2020. Gina Sanchez stated Palantir was down due to heavy exposure to the oil and gas industry but that makes zero sense to me as I don't see how oil prices are even related to a big data company like Palantir.

Can someone explain to me how lying on national T.V is allowed?
