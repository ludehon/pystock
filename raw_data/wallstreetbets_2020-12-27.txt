 üöÄ üöÄ PSTH Explained - I've Had Enough - This is a Monetary Handout - Please Take It And Stop Private Messaging MeüöÄ üöÄ **I am sorry if this is not news to you. I really am.**

However, I am so discouraged today. I am the author of several PSTH DDs. Until my most recent DD, I figured this was on the WSB radar. Boy, was I wrong. A ton of private messages amazed me today and I had no choice but to post another explanation of this tontine structure. Please god, read the content. I made it short for you.

\------------------

**TLDR;**

PSTH is a the biggest SPAC ever created (fact). For every 9 common shares you hold through merger, you get 2 more at $23. The stock is at $26 today and is going mile high (some projecting \~$100 based on other IPOs and the size and target list) in Jan or Feb on LOI.

\-------------------

**My most recent DD on PSTH (1/3, others were pinned by mods) that summarizes everything you need to know:**  [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kkukb8/psth\_warning\_shot\_qa\_ive\_done\_well\_in\_this\_market/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kkukb8/psth_warning_shot_qa_ive_done_well_in_this_market/)

\--------------------

***It has become blatantly obvious that most of you are COMPLETELY IGNORANT OF THE PSTH PLAY AND IN SPECIFIC THE WARRANT INCENTIVE YOU ARE NOT TAKING ADVANTAGE OF.***

**We therefor go to the PSTH S1 since no one on this sub can read or google or do both at the same time:**

As the largest blank check company currently pursuing a business combination, we can offer a larger-capitalization private company (with market capitalization of $10,000,000,000 or more) the opportunity to gain access to the public equity markets, without such company having to conduct its own initial public offering (‚ÄúIPO‚Äù). Through a merger, we will be, in effect, facilitating the IPO of a large private company, enabling a private business to avoid the inherent costs and risks associated with the traditional IPO process.

First, our Distributable Tontine Redeemable Warrants provide our public stockholders with incentives not to redeem their shares of Class¬†A Common Stock in connection with our initial business combination. We will issue a fixed pool of 44,444,444 Distributable Tontine Redeemable Warrants; **holders who choose to redeem their shares will lose the right to receive any such warrants.** Public stockholders who choose not to redeem their shares of Class¬†A Common Stock will share in this fixed pool with other non-redeeming holders (on a pro-rata basis), and will receive the additional warrants that were effectively surrendered by redeeming holders. ***As a result, public stockholders who do not redeem their shares will receive at least two-ninths of a Distributable Tontine Redeemable Warrant per share they hold, and a proportionally greater amount as other holders elect to redeem.*** We believe this structure will likely lead to a lower level of redemptions, and therefore, we will likely have more funds available for our initial business combination.

**NOW PAY ATTENTION, From the S1:**

**PSTH.U**

**Securities offered:**

200,000,000 units, at $20.00 per unit, each unit consisting of:

one share of Class¬†A Common Stock;

one-ninth of one Distributable Redeemable Warrant; **and**

***a contingent right to receive Distributable Tontine Redeemable Warrants***

\-------------------------------

**What is the** ***contingent right to receive Distributable Tontine Redeemable Warrants*** **you ask?**

**"By way of example, if no public stockholders elect to redeem their shares of Class¬†A Common Stock in connection with our initial business combination,** ***for every nine shares of Class¬†A Common Stock held by a public stockholder and not redeemed, such holder would receive two Distributable Tontine Redeemable Warrants."***

AGAIN: ***for every nine shares of Class¬†A Common Stock held by a public stockholder and not redeemed, such holder would receive two Distributable Tontine Redeemable Warrants."***

AGAIN: ***for every nine shares of Class¬†A Common Stock held by a public stockholder and not redeemed, such holder would receive two Distributable Tontine Redeemable Warrants."***

AGAIN SAY IT WITH ME: ***for every nine shares of Class¬†A Common Stock held by a public stockholder and not redeemed, such holder would receive two Distributable Tontine Redeemable Warrants."***

\------

*IT GETS BETTER*

***"If half of the shares of Class¬†A Common Stock issued in this offering are redeemed, for every nine shares of Class¬†A Common Stock held by a public stockholder and not redeemed, such holder would receive four Distributable Tontine Redeemable Warrants.*** The contingent right to receive such warrants will remain attached to the shares of Class¬†A Common Stock sold in this offering and will not be separately transferable, assignable or salable."

\------

*Come with me and you'll be, in a world of pure imagination*....

Take a history lesson folks, as [Deep Throat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Follow_the_money) famously said during the Watergate scandal, "***Follow the money***".

***In PSTH,*** ***Follow the Smart Money***\*\*\*...\*\*\*

\-------

That is it. Sorry but I have been shocked more than ever before by the ignorance I have witnessed on WSB. Level 5, 6 and 7 accounts commenting dogshit misinformation.

***MODS MESSAGING ME ASKING ME TO CLARIFY THE WARRANTS. JESUS CHRIST.***

Merry Christmas.

Then I decided to do my own research and see a company that could certainly be more and no one can do what they can do. 

For boomers who don't know what snapchat is. It is a camera application that helps people to communicate through short videos and images known as a Snap. The Company provides Camera, Friends Page, Discover, Snap Map, Memories and Spectacles. Snapchat opens directly into the Camera, helping in creating a Snap and sending it to friends. It offers a range of creative tools that enables people to personalize and add content to their Snaps. Its chat services includes creating and watching stories, chatting with groups, making voice and video calls, and communicating through a range of stickers and Bitmojis. Memories enable users to create Snaps and stories from their saved snaps, as well as their camera roll. It also offers Spectacles, its sunglasses that make Snap. The Company's advertising products include Snap Ads and Sponsored Creative Tools, such as Sponsored Lenses and Sponsored Geofilters.

[The different screens on the app ](https://preview.redd.it/s2hqqja8ss761.png?width=300&format=png&auto=webp&s=49ebfd663de32d3995f69127153a251dd22a5257)

Snapchat is the #1 social media company from middle schoolers to millennials. Not everybody has Facebook, Instagram, or twitter. But in the younger age groups snapchat has become almost as common as a phone number and rather then asking for a phone number one may say "Can I have your snap?".  

Snapchat also stands out from other social media companies because it is the best at monetizing its users. Snapchat does not make money from its users, but rather takes its large amount of users and their data and then presents it to companies who wish to advertise. On top of that, snapchat has stayed true to its users and is very receptive of what users have to say, using their feedback to consistently better the app. I have been a user of the app since 2013. 

But going back to the main point of monetization because that's what you gambling addict fuckers love to know, snapchat has over one third of monetization of twitter and over one fifth of monetization of Facebook and Snapchat's growth outpaces them so much that it is not even close. Below is a table of snapchat growth just in the United State alone. Over half of the people from 12 years old to 34 years old have fucking snapchat and growth in users has grown about 5% a year and beats expectations consistently while twitter misses expectations every quarter and gets in trouble because so many users are inactive or fucking bots. But also going off twitter, Snapchat recently came with a deal connected to twitter so tweets can be directly taken from twitter and posted on snapchat. And the more integrated snapchat becomes in our society, the growth of users will only become more exponential.

Long Term Bullish Case:

Snap is winning with an "unduplicated and hard-to-reach audience.‚Äù And while Facebook is getting in trouble for monopolies, snapchat is coming right under our noses with the fact that they provide exposure to multiple, seemingly unstoppable forces: digital ad spending, mobile gaming and entertainment, and overall smartphone addiction which is only expected to grow and do not see any case where growth will be stopped anytime soon, throw in the coronavirus as a catapult that launches this stock to the moon. Around one third of Americans currently have Snapchat, how long till the rest of the world starts to catch up?

Snapchat is entirely different then other social media companies because of how private you can make things. And the experience is a lot more personal which separates it from twitter, Instagram, and Facebook. Which are all basically the same thing and makes Snap is in a different league of its own and has so much room to grow. Even though you missed out on ipo prices, theres no reason to miss out on more potential gains and in the last week there has been a dip of around 4% which is the perfect time to buy the fucking dip and ride the rocket to tendie town. 

Funds are buying it and lots of unusual options activity is evident.

Cannot go tits up, free money_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Digital Banking will be huge for $SE - comparing market opp for them &#x200B;

SE is has a 98B market cap.

$SE just got the license to operate as a fully digital bank in Singapore. This is great for a number of reasons (strengthening shoppeepay) and to generating money as a bank. The data insights from one of the biggest online shopping platform giants partnered with banking can bring massive potential to the company.

Amazon only offers a creditcard, that is small compared to operating a fully digital bank. There are so many more products $SE can offer clients (mortgages, LoC, heloc). Singapore is also just the start.

ShopeePay is currently in Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines. **It is only a matter of time before $SE is able to launch a digital bank in the other countries.** Looking at the careers pay there are hiring exec level positions for SeaMoney in the Philippines.

it also doesn't just stop there too. Where Shopee has a foothold in other countries such as Brazil. Sea is also working to building out the financial sector there too. Look at this posting for "**Head of Payments - (S√£o Paulo)**"

&#x200B;

SE is valued under 100B compare that to Amazon at over a trillion. There is huge potential for $SE, especially in these growing economies. If anyone has read Ray Dalio rise and fall of empires, it is about rise and fall of countries. Cathie Wood also treats these major FAANGs like cash cause they grow so slow, and she invests in the next set of FAANGs. Look how much she has been adding to her portfolio

TLDR: Invest in $SE (located in tiger economies, strong upside potential, lots of integration between online shopping and finance, cathie wood buys tons of it). Anything under $200/share is a steal for what this company will be worth

Every year people criticize apple for not innovating enough and keeping a strictly limited product line. If you‚Äôre familiar with this concept, this is why Rolex blabs beaten Omega by limiting abundance of products. 

However, we‚Äôre starting to see this fade and has over aged in the tech sector and Apples timing is perfect. 

Apple has literal Trillions of dollars at their disposal to build an EV car. All the companies we‚Äôve seen so far are bull shit penny stock garage cars. The largest company in the world is taking its turn. 

They have battery technology, computing technology, and whatever budget they need. They don‚Äôt need to be profitable with the car or even get revenue far far far into the future, this gives them an advantage over everyone, even TSLA.

1) NET @ 84.50<, closed @ 84.98, +1%>

2) EDIT @ 64.75<, closed @ 83.53, +29%

3) CRSR @ 40.40<, closed at 36.35, -10%

For CRSR, I took a loss on it. I would never hold a stock when I'm -7/8% on the position from entry, its telling you that something is off. Maybe ur timing, maybe the overall market, doesnt matter what it is, it just matters that you get out and figure it out after. I normally take losses anywhere from 1-5%, depending on a variety of factors. Great example of how the "level" doesnt always work. Love that. 

&#x200B;

As for this week here is what I am looking at (I currently dont see a ton of set ups, that is information).

1) PLTR @ 29<, this is the level, if you can watch the price action here, do it, it is volatile, but I think if it breaks thru this area it has a strong chance of moving closer to 40-45. Needs to see volume for me to have strong conviction. Also, im happy to get chopped up in here a few times (if thats what happens) just to catch a portion of the BO. I really like the risk reward at this level.

2) DKNG @ 55<, similar to PLTR, getting tight and im trying to see if it will break out above that 55-56 area, I like the decreasing volume here in this tight little range, looks like it is coiled. We shall see though.

&#x200B;

Both of these positions I would play smaller, not because they are volatile, but because I have a good year and Im not looking to "press the gas" right at the end. Im content. Im looking fwd to next year. Good luck everyone, and congrats on making it through 2020, a year most will never forget.

(Not enough retail to break the balance board.) Now many people are confused about some past posts so I figured we need to go into the deep technical fundamentals on why people hoping for a "rocket" so called on Monday will be instead met with a continuing crash. let me break this down with 3 fundamental stock activity charts that focus on the last 5 days of GME trading activity below.

&#x200B;

[Technical charts showing stock activity, shows the rise, start of doom, and crash which will continue on Monday. Click to zoom in.](https://preview.redd.it/mtey1hnv7s761.png?width=1326&format=png&auto=webp&s=618569d9fbfb1e252c6cbd62736bcd17bc2100fd)

**Now then, the dissection:**

1. **The first chart shows the full 5 days and what is called the "balance board" the balance board is usually a heavily resistant and stubborn point that if broken, usually leads to a massive spike that may have short or long duration. As you can see within the last 5 trading days of last week (today is Sunday so new week) even with inflated retail, fomoing, and a squeeze, GME could not break the balance board, and in fact declined as attempts to continue to fail.**
2. Also on image 1 is the clear visual of when the rocket took off, Dec 22nd. That's the end of the flt lower line on Image 1 before the spike up.
3. Image 2 points out the drop later on that week, showing that the big firms, hedges, and other rich conglomerates that control a significant portion of the market where starting to pull and retail and other smaller conglomerates were losing the ability to pump up the stock,
4. Finally in image number 3, on Thursday the last day of the week, the big firms, hedges, and rich conglomerates did not go in or pulled back leading to a crash, you can tell by the trajectory of the fall and the grey line (which is for after hours trading) that the amount of investment and pumping by retail and smaller conglomerates were not significantly less than before.
5. Expanding on point number 4 above, if you look at the after hours grey line, retail and others were still trying to push the stock up but because too much of the market controllers pulled back or/and stopped investing they were not able to not only keep up the pace from days before, but to bring back the GME stock into the green after hours.

**All the points above show that more big movers will pull or stall while retail and other smaller investor individuals and groups will lose the ability to move the stock higher**, it will keep crashing until some part of the bigger market movers jumps in to give a platform for all that retail pump to bounce off.

As you can see on chart 3 the trading activity of these individuals in groups did not drop, the only thing that dropped was big funding and big money either stalling or pulling the rug a bit. And look at how it crashed the stock, and how even with low volume during after hours retail still couldn't get the stock back up even back to the CLOSING LEVEL they failed.

We should prepare for a continuing crash on Monday and possibly a bigger major crash back into the low 10's or single digits later this week. Do not be fooled, no time has WSB continued a long fomo has it ever kept going up, there is no exception, get out and/or buy puts now. People were expecting the squeeze on Wednesday and Thursday, it came and couldn't break the balance board, and crashed on Thursday. People are forgetting about Thursdays crash and are hand waiving it as some temporary feet

***But there are no fundamentals or technical analysis to support this stock moving past the balance board***, and with no big major cash movers to help retail or smaller conglomerates move the stock, they can't move the stock by themselves, this just isn't possible.

My mom has been watching them since she started investing in the stock market. 

From the beginning she was investing in blue chip stocks: Google, Amazon, Apple. But now she almost has 100 shares of Tesla, and wants to buy more instead of diversifying. She even bought Palantir and Nio. Luckily, she doesn't seem to know how to use options, but that could change any day and I have literally lost sleep over this because my mom is getting financial advice from a bunch of idiots from Reddit.

My family is going through some immense personal and financial issues, and I can't believe she rolled over her 401k just to YOLO it all. She was supposed to use that money to pay the mortgage. She's way too old to play with all these risks. And now she won't listen to me because Tesla actually made her money. She doesn't realize she's playing within a bubble, and she has literally no investing strategy. I can't believe I'm the one who is more stressed out about this than she is.

Yet as much as I hate you all, I can't help but be awed but how you guys have risen from the depths of 4chan to getting the attention of Bloomberg and Cramer, and now even a bunch of foreign broadcast financial personalities are eating your bullshit.

Most of people here will not even notice this post, but for those who will see it - if you haven't lost your money investing - feel really lucky! Go and read this thread: /r/wallstreetbets/comments/kjr9vs/tell_me_your_story/

Why I decided to post this useless message? After seeing posts from people who made 1000% in last few months I started to feel real freaking FOMO. Market is getting into a bubble right now, everything I check is like 50-1000% up this year! And people who had money to invest on time are getting big tendies. I started to have few sleepless nights recently, because I am waiting for market to open on Monday so much. I have a plan to improve my investing, and don't want to miss the train to the moon üåù

However, my mental health is taking a toll. Big day!

Luckily after reading posts of people who lost the money, or keep investments small, or made pennies like me - I feel a lot calmer! It helped me to realise that ultra-retards yoloing 100k and pulling out 300% are extremely rare. We're having social media effect here, when a small group of people creates artificial reality of instant success.

Please, be careful small investors. Always remember that most people lose money here.

Trades included (no tsla) _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Taxes question? So, not only did I lose my money, I also lost the 5000 dollars those robinhood developers let me borrow. 

My question is sort of 2 parts...
How urgent is it that I pay robinhood back the money I used?
Second part, how does this borrowed money and my overall losses effect my taxes this year? Do I still need to set aside money from the gains I had that I threw away or since I went negative by the end of the year am I good on taxes?

Edit. Thanks to trader Dennis I went to my history, I DID NOT use robinhoods loaned money, I instant deposited 5k and removed it from my bank before it went through so the balance was already invested into options that went red before my balance even went through.

No, this isn‚Äôt about PSTH. It‚Äôs about my other favorite stock and second biggest holding, Twilio ($TWLO).

I believe this to be a sleeping giant heading into 2021. Twilio ($TWLO) is a cloud services company that has seen exceptional gains over the course of the last three quarters.

**Overview**

Twilio ($TWLO) is a developer of communications software, cloud-based platform, and services. **Twilio is a leading communications platform firm that enables developers to integrate communications capabilities such as messaging, voice, and video into client-facing products, thus helping businesses strengthen customer engagement worldwide.** Its platform consists of the following sectors: engagement cloud, programmable communications cloud, and super network.

Via TWLO, businesses can integrate real-time communications capabilities into business applications, expanding the number of touchpoints with their customers. Twilio‚Äôs value proposition comes from the building blocks available to developers who can use software to assimilate new customer-facing offerings within their applications. Some simple use cases include automatic text notifications for appointments and two-factor authentication for secure services such as WhatsApp. The Programmable communications cloud software is a set of tools that enables developers to embed voice, messaging, and video capabilities into their applications. The super network is a software layer that allows customers' software to communicate with connected devices globally.

**In other words, they are involved in sales happening online re: e-commerce and get a chunk of that action.**

Twilio has done its own research on this and that coronavirus response accelerated digital communication strategies by about six years for businesses.

The CEO cites this in the Cramer interview and uses the very interesting of NIKE as a digital salesforce using TWLO platforms to reach out to customers. The change in focus can be illustrated by Twilio‚Äôs stock run this year, growing 277% year to date. The shares climbed 1.6% higher Tuesday to new highs, closing at $370.75.

**MORNING STAR REPORT SUMMARY**

¬∑ Twilio has elite retention rates within the software industry, with gross retention hovering around 97% and net dollar retention north of 120%.

¬∑ We think this is indicative of the stickiness of the firm‚Äôs platform.

¬∑ The proposed acquisition of Segment ties together Twilio‚Äôs software stack and will increase business reliance on the firm for customer engagement.

¬∑ As Twilio invests more in Solutions APIs, there should be a shift away from lower margin products such as messaging, which should also contribute to increased recurring revenues.

¬∑ ‚ÄúWe view narrow-moat Twilio as having a long growth runway ahead, as the company continues to make strategic organic and inorganic investments to expand its platform.‚Äù

**Key Points re the Bull Case**

Several big-time analysts/names have come out calling for a big bull session for TWLO in 2021

**Alex Zukin** ‚Äì hugely respected and respected analyst from RBC ranked TWLO as the top software pick for 2021 - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5IXWtG9jQU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5IXWtG9jQU)

**Jim Cramer**, you know him ‚Äì He‚Äôs also come out as a big TWLO bull. [https://twitter.com/jimcramer/status/1341822886043070469](https://twitter.com/jimcramer/status/1341822886043070469)

Enough from analysts and Cramer though, there are people in the background that lead these people to post about stocks. The managers at Baron Funds are who I am talking about. Baron Funds is incredibly bullish on TWLO. Chief among their managers is **Alex Umansky**.

[https://www.barrons.com/articles/stock-fund-soaring-despite-coronavirus-51596060341](https://www.barrons.com/articles/stock-fund-soaring-despite-coronavirus-51596060341)

**Oh, and if you don‚Äôt know who or what Baron Funds are, look into it. Ron Baron is who laid the groundwork for me becoming bullish on TSLA in Q1.**

Baron has been in on TSLA since 2013. He has been mocked and laughed at over the years for his huge position. Through the pandemic, he has not sold a single share, and only laments not being able to buy more. Even ARK got out of TSLA to some degree on this bull run. Baron Fund has done DD on TSLA and are projecting, based on numbers, revenue, and management (not hype) another 5-10x gain over the next 5 years. Some Ron Baron Balling on YouTube.

Basically, DUNKING on the silly TSLA bears: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5QJlTMADGQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5QJlTMADGQ)

Anyways, these are the people placing TWLO in their funds in big numbers now. These are the people who actually make money. Do you like Bill Ackman? I do too. Ron Baron is the quieter guy in the background managing 3X as much as Ackman. Baron Fund‚Äôs Alex Umansky, the architect of the TWLO play is amazing though, he‚Äôs been on a killing spree basically‚Ä¶. Up 60% on the year with his 1.5B portfolio at Baron. He has tripled his investment on TWLO thus far with no intent on selling.

Facebook's hardware division produces Portal (video teleconferencing), Oculus Quest (Virtual Reality), and is working toward Augmented Reality glasses. A precursor to Augmented Reality glasses is coming in 2021 through a partnership with Luxottica (they make Oakley and Ray ban). Each Oculus Quest 2 sold requires an active Facebook account to use the device, and if you delete your Facebook you lose your purchases. The Oculus Quest 2 has been reported to have a production run of 3 million units per year, and it has been backordered by a month since preorders began.

In the consumer hardware space, 3 million units per year isn't huge, but this is somewhere between 50%-100% growth on last years numbers, so it's growing fast. It isn't enough to make Facebook a major hardware producer, but is it enough to put a moat between itself and other social media companies? The major bear case seems to be that social media moves fast and the thing that replaces Facebook could be right around the corner, but how can a social media company replace Facebook if a significant portion of Facebook's userbase eventually needs to maintain an account to operate very endeared hardware?

This is assuming people will be willing to purchase Facebook's hardware. After watching years of Facebook dominating the consumer VR space by pricing superior products at subsidized prices, I'm convinced they can have success even in the face of a vocal adversarial minority.

Edit to add: Breaking into consumer hardware has been difficult and expensive for Facebook, I doubt any other social media company even has the cash, and time to attempt such an endeavor _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ BUY THE DIP!! _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Monday $BABA dropping? _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ ATM Debit Spreads--The Holy Grail during dovish times?

Vertical spreads negate the effect of theta decay (since you're selling an OTM call) and you don't have to do much besides close the spread the week of expiration. My plan is to close something that has lost 50% value and then just open another spread 6 weeks later.

Obviously there are pitfalls, but has anyone been trading ATM spreads for a while? I've been doing OK the last couple months with Amazon spreads even though it's been basically flat (I've been getting 60-80% returns when I close them the week of expiration), but I'm going to switch to SQ and maybe something like Visa or MSFT.

Yes, stonks might go down every once in a while, but if things are going to stay dovish (and the last decade shows the US likes to keep it that way), why wouldn't this be the best strategy? Does anyone have more experience with ATM debit spreads? Anyone have any other good tickers for this play?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Why does Burry own MSGN? Michael Burry or Scion currently owns at least 850,000 shares of MSGN. He bought at $9.57 in Q3 2020 and it's currently trading at $13.59. I've seen a lot of talk lately about him owning LUMN (another breakout opportunity IMO), but I haven't seen a single mention of this one.


Now, volume on this is very low, so options are probably not the play here even though they're crazy cheap. They blew earnings out of the water in Q4, and it has a much lower P/E than the competition. But their book value is -9. 


Has anyone else taken a look at this? Thoughts?

I might go over some points, but this is what I consider most important. Let's go.

&#x200B;

***Some of the facts:***

\- We're at the start of a new console cycle, which historically has always lead to a massive spike in share price. Even with the price surge in the last few months, we're still less than 1/6th of what GME was priced at last console cycle. And it's only just begun.

\- 250% of outstanding share float is shorted [(as of Dec. 14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kkjidv/short_of_float_update_gme_the_short_squeeze_is/) This means that there are more short positions than actually shares outstanding, which would create a problem for the shorters, should there be a catalyst that moves the price upwards, [creating a short squeeze.](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortsqueeze.asp)

\- Ryan Cohen, a 35 year old successful businessman, Billionaire, who self-admittedly only invests in companies he believes buys  a 9,98% stake in GameStop and has since increased it to 12,9%.

\- Ryan Cohen sends the BoD [a letter](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326380/000101359420000821/rc13da3-111620.pdf) where he tells them all how unhappy he is with how things are going and that they should get their shit together. This is done BEFORE he increases his stake to 12,9%

\- GameStop has its Q3 earnings which aren't great, but not as bad as projected, their online sales are up over 250% YTY and they have an additional $300 million in their cash reserve ($600 million for a company who's market cap currently is just over $1 Billion). [Link to Q3 Transcript](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/12/09/gamestop-gme-q3-2020-earnings-call-transcript/)

\- We learn that they're closing 1000 stores which are hurting their profit by Q1 of 2021 and are doing some rebranding work. [Stores Shutdown](https://bestlifeonline.com/gamestop-closing/) and [Rebranding](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k66w5h/gme_rebranding_in_progress_theyve_just_changed/)

\- RC Ventures files another 13D on December 22 where he discloses how he increased his stake above 10% to 12,9% with another message for the board ***"While the reporting persons desire to come to an amicable resolution with the issuer, the reporting persons will not hesitate to take any actions that they believe are necessary to protect the best interests of all stockholders."*** [Link to 13D](https://fintel.io/doc/sec/1822844/000119380520001571/e620151_sc13da-gamestop.htm)

\- Investing research group Hedgeye pitches long-term potential for [GME with price target of "$50+".](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kiv44e/gme_target_50/)

&#x200B;

Now most of you should get a good idea why GME is a good bet short-term if you've read the above DD and do some logical thinking. There is also an argument to be made about the future potential it has, if Cohen does indeed turn the ship around and polish this into something magnificent. 

But you need some vision to see that, and I'm not trying to push you retards too much out of your comfort zone.

First of all, happy holidays yall. Time for some good old retail. Bed Bath and Beyond reports earnings before the market opens on Thursday, 1/7. It's a heavily shorted stock (more than 50% of the float is shorted, I believe).

As most of you guys already know, Bed Bath stock hasn't fared too well these past few years. It's been run down by competition and the like, poor decisions, bad earnings and sales, and it's down roughly 60% 5YTD.

CEO Mark Tritton has stepped in and is transforming the company. And yes, he is indeed transforming Bed Bath dramatically. Completely changing the management, selling off non-core subsidiaries like Cost Plus World Market and Christmas Tree Holdings, and buying back stock. And I mean MASSIVE buybacks. The company is slated to buy back nearly 20% of outstanding shares by 2023, so close to 1 billion dollars of shares.

The landscape for home goods retailers and retail in general is changing - and so is the e-commerce front. So Bed Bath and Beyond has stepped up its game in the digital space, as well as using warehouses to fulfill digital orders. Pivots were made extremely fast, and these may be crucial to Bed Bath's future success. Guidance is currently set at flat growth for FY21 but I think if management raises guidance to high single digit growth and blows estimates out of the park this quarter, we could see a huge short squeeze upwards.

Thoughts?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $YUM KFConsole is literally going to print tendies from tendies. Gamers are sick and tired of only 4 console options to game on, being nintendo, sony, microsoft, and pc. Kentucky Fried Chicken is confident in releasing this console, and I do not believe they would have if they didn't believe they could give us tendies. It has a tendie warmer built in, if that tells you anything. Release will likely be late summer/early fall, and the hype on this puppy will be crazy.

And no, I'm not joking. Sounds insane but I'm confident it'll print. Looks like it's in a dip right now. 

$YUM  135c 16 JUL_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ The Importance of Ambiguity in the Meme Market We have been in the meme market for a while now, and a big aspect of the big winners has been **ambiguity**. 


It's easy to visualize what Carnival Cruise does. They sell vacations on boats. The opposite is true for Palantir - they sift through data to enable their clients to operate as efficiently as possible. Whereas Carnival is limited to the high seas and island excursions, Palantir promises (and has shown) improvements in a variety of industries, whether it is helping police departments catch criminals or aiding Ferrari's racing efforts. 


In short, if we were to visualize various industries as a geographical map where companies covered their respective interests, the borders for a cruise company would be clear, whereas Palantir's borders would be fuzzy.


These fuzzy lines easily allow for more hype to be drum up. There have been dozens of articles over the past months about various contracts PLTR has acquired, from vaccine distribution to military operations, keeping them in the news and our short attention spans focused on them.  


This is why Tesla has excelled. Musk is constantly promoting different industries Tesla can expand to, even if it is unclear how they will get there. Not only does he reference sub-groups in the auto industry, but he links Tesla to other ambitious projects, from the battery industry to public transportation.


Not to mention, if we are in a bubble, then it would make sense people would invest in companies whose market potential is hard to define. *You can't say a stock has hit it's ceiling if you can't define the ceiling in the first place.* This gives you an easy excuse to throw fundamentals out the door (albeit a silly one).


Usually uncertainty is bad news in the stock market, but now it is embraced as potential. Personally, I am going to accept our new meme overlords by investing in **ARKK** and **ARKG**. Innovation should continue to rise as the meme markets thrive, and the Genetic Revolution is a potential trillion dollar industry once unlocked. Think of genetics as a desert sun transported over a frozen tundra - in the dawn slowly showing it's head over the snow capped mountains, soon to thaw our new lives as midday finally comes.

Alright you bunch of single digit IQ meat-containers gather round as I'm about to tell you why you should not doubt that $MT is absolutely 100% the play and I'm holding onto to it harder than your wife is holding her boyfriend's nuts in between her lips. 

I was binge watching some youtube videos and smoking some sweet-tart flavored weed vape when I was suggested, by the algorithm, a channel called economics explained. The channel is not small with 800k+ subscribers and pretty good content so I was surprised I hadn't ran into it before since I watch a lot of financial stuff, but I'm getting sidetracked. So I'm going through and watching videos on forex, cryptos and ponzi schemes etc. You know? The rabbit hole that is the youtube algorithm, and I ran into this video called "WHY ARE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF SHIPS BEING INTENTIONALLY DESTROYED?" I love ships so naturally I was curious. Now, when I first started watching this random video I thought the reason ships were being scrapped was because older ships are less efficient so they scrap them to make room for new ones.

I was wrong.

A couple minutes into the video the narrator mentions that some of the ships still have over a decade of life left when scrapped. Now I'm thinking maybe a fuck ton of shipping companies are going broke in other parts of the world and again....

I was wrong. 

As the video progresses he explains how shipping works how margins are tight and a whole bunch of other shit I'm too retarded to understand and then starts talking about stimulus packages and how different countries are investing in themselves such as China which is spending a fuck ton of money on infrastructure thus needing tons of iron.

So when he gets to the point of answering why these ships are being scrapped and he mentions the price of steel it fucking hit me. THESE MOTHERFUCKERS ARE SCRAPPING SHIPS WITH PLENTY OF LIFE LEFT IN THEM BECAUSE THE PRICE OF IRON IS SO FUCKING HIGH I HAVE TO SMOKE 2 MORE JOINTS JUST TO SEE IT...

So I open reddit and come over to wallstreetbets and the first post I see is Vito's from a couple hours ago... Now I'm not a religious person (don't know if you can't tell from my name, but y'all can't read so...) but this was like the universe slapping me in the face and telling me I'll be the biggest bitch ever if I don't go balls deep.

***First order of business, I assure you I am not here to pump targets. Just levelling with the WSB community, which I have come to love and value.***

***Second order of business, before you dismiss this play, read at least a bit to understand the nature of the Tontine structure. Amazing value and big reason we see some many heavyweights gobbling up this stock. Literally stuffing their faces with PSTH, they are.***

I started posting about Pershing Square Tontine Holdings Ltd ($PTSH) around a month ago.

Here are my DDs in order of appearance. The last one sums up and provides updates. The comments section in the first one is most instructive for people who are at least aware of the SPAC.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k3bf1o/psth\_dd\_klarman\_buffet\_ackman\_the\_unicorn\_hunter/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k3bf1o/psth_dd_klarman_buffet_ackman_the_unicorn_hunter/)

**My DDs have garnered a decent conversation in the comments threads.** I've learned a lot through that process, so thanks. I hope you have learned something too. Ultimately most of us are just trying to learn and lock in enough capital to make life easier and more enjoyable for ourselves and our families. To be part of WSB in that joint endeavor is special.

**This is a perplexing SPAC. It has the dubious distinction of being BOTH THE BIGGEST SPAC EVER BROUGHT TO MARKET AND THE LEAST REPORTED ON IN THE PRESS.**

**Notably, its gotten some attention on reddit and Twitter.**

In any case, I bring a short message below about how attractive this thing is, in addition to the info above. I have my positions locked in already. I have dramatically, dramatically changed a big portfolio around to dump the majority of my capital into this stock. I am holding it for 12 mo at a minimum (likely at least 40% until retirement) and have made appropriate lifestyle modifications to plan for that outcome, even in this crazy market.

I am just convinced that this stock is not being publicized for some sinister reason. I don't want to go all conspiratorial but I really think its media malpractice for them to not be letting people know about this investment vehicle.

**CNBC HAS CHAMATH ON EVERY FUCKING DAY AND THEY NEVER HAVE PSTH ON. EVEN IF ACKMAN DENIED THE INTERVIEW, THEY STILL DON'T EVEN COVER IT. DID CRAMER LOSE MONEY WITH ACKMAN???? WHAT IS HAPPENING HERE????**

I digress...

If I dumped everything I have into this now and quit investing, I would retire with the wealth of the last ten generations of my family combined, and I am not from a poor family (sorry).

**Anyways, here it is. Its something, some say, rivals the likes of which we haven't seen.**

**--The PSTH Play--**

PSTH warrants have a strike price of $23 and so every 9 common shares you own now pre-merger allows you to buy 2 additional shares post merger close at a price of $23 per share. AKA TONTINE.

Right now $PSTH is $3.03 above the strike price of $23 at $26.03.

**So for the price of 9 shares today ($234.27) and buying 2 additional shares at the Strike of $23, you will own 11 shares in the future which means your average cost is actually (($234.27+46)/11 = $25.47 (TONTINE).**

Targets really ultimately don't matter for us. **Bloomberg, amazing. In-n-Out, wonderful. Stripe, holy shit. SpaceX, we are in a simulation and Elon Musk is the overlord, what the fuck is happening, omg we are going to mars.**

Regardless of who Ackman picks up, you‚Äôre essentially guaranteed to have a low entry price here and be in the money **bigly**.

**TONTINE TRICKS: Oh and it‚Äôs possible you can get 3/9 or 4/9 additional warrants for every 9 you own, thus bringing the average price DOWN EVEN FURTHER. The warrants are only given out for shareholders who hold through the merger and there is a set amount of them that go out to someone!**

\----

Over the weekend a warm calm came over me. I feel I have investigated this play for months and I have learned a lot about investing and life in the process.

Ultimately, I have only felt as sure about something as I did with Tesla in March of 2020 when the stock was trading at $385 before it split (equivalent of $77 today, with TSLA trading at $660).

**I am envisioning a 250% gain in the next 4 months.**

**Merry Christmas WSB! And Stay Safe & Lucrative...**

Or is it necessary to take a look on the numbers like P / E Ratio - i mean you know its a battery factory - they are making batterys for wireless headsets from apple, power cells for EV and pretty small hydrogen cells - so its like a combination of Apple, NIO and PLUG!

Now I know most of you missed the first thread, so check the post history for the full scoop but the TLDR is I flipped 3k -> 56k from my first options play around the USA 2020 Election.

Now having made mad gains, I did what any respectable ~~boomer~~ investor would do, I diversified my portfolio into a series of high yield dividend stocks so I could spend the rest of my life living off a meager amount of income because I am a paper handed pussy

&#x200B;

Just kidding,

&#x200B;

Took out 10k for hookers/blow/toys

bought a few shares in Nintendo and Apple

and yolo'd the rest on Corsair contracts (\~31k)

&#x200B;

Can't take credit for anything other than for my massive sack

&#x200B;

Saw an excellent DD on wsb and I had recently built a pc so I was familiar with the space.

Seemed like a obvious $40+ value bought in around 28.9 exited at 45

with this trade (and my stocks juicing) portfolio broke 100k

So currently I have 50% of my money in PLTR and 50% in GME. I aim to hold these stocks for a while (or til a squeeze üòâ) and believe both will have a very strong 2021 üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

So I guess my question is do I take some profits off the table for my PLTR  and YOLO all my money into GME? The aim would be to get in and out with some GME gains and get back into PLTR  in early January right around January 6th-8th, way before the showcase on the 26th. Just would be kicking myself if I didnt max out a possible squeeze but I definitely want a stake of the PLTR rocket when it moons! üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

How are other fellow GME and PLTR holders approaching this?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Melvin's losing money on its GME puts. Let's get it over $24 retards! _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_
