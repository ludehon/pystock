 Clean energy ETFs that DON'T emphasize hydrogen fuel cell tech (ie. $PLUG)? I'm pretty deep on $ICLN, however, I don't think fuel cells are a viable long-term option.

They seem to be self fulfilling prophecies. As soon as Citron publishes something, people sell off and their short “prediction” becomes correct and they make a bunch of money.

As soon as MF publishes something a crowd of people invest. As long as they pick good quality companies, the  company then gets more public mindshare, and raises more capital, which makes that particular company more likely to intrinsically increase the value of their stock over the next 5-10 years.

Good example would be Lemonade. As soon as MF published their bull article and then doubled down a month later, LMND shot up from 60 per share all the way to 188.

I'm not here to discuss whether EV is the way of the future or not, nor who is the best in the industry.

Yes there will be a demand for it in many countries, but I feel a lot of people are completely ignoring the number of players in this industry as only a handful of them are ever mentioned here.

Let me provide some context on the vast # of companies in or entering the EV space (and counting)...

TSLA, NIO, XPEV, LI, VW, F, GM, T, Hyundai, Nissan, BMW, Porsche, Chery, BAIC, BYD, KNDI, (soon to be public) Lucid, FSKR, Byton, Faraday, Rivian, RIDE, NKLA (lol but still had to mention it) Kia, Polestar, Honda, Renault, CllG, and Mercedes-benz.

I mean, I get it there is a market for EV's and not all these manufacturers are competing for the same customer but given the sheer amount of those in the industry I just don't see how they can *all* end up successful. As of now it seems the best strategy is to go with those already ahead and hope it continues to stay that way.

I am not a financial advisor, please do your own due diligence. 

China is going to announce the Q4 GDP on Jan 17. According to multiple media outlets, the Dragon is set to post positive growth and retail spending. They are infact expected to be one of the only 20 countries to post a positive growth in 2020.

More than just the absolute numbers, I am more encouraged by their rate of growth. Their GDP shrunk -6.8% in Q1 of 2020 but it recovered with record expansions of 3.2% and 4.9% in Q2 and Q3. If the Q4 growth exceeds 6%, that can lead to an overwhelmingly positive market sentiment, shooting the Chinese stocks higher.
China's central bank does not look in any mood to increase the rates anytime soon either, which could lead to much better YoY growth in 2021 because of the low standards of 2020.

The only caveat on the horizon seems to be the renewed lockdown fears in China. But I believe that is still way less worrisome than the situation in the US.

NFE had a meteoric rise last  year I got in around 16.5 and hopped out around 45 for a nice gain.  They are moving forward with a lot of growth (reccent purchase of Hygo  from GLNG and pending approval for expansion of Puerto Rico LNG  facility). I think there is still room to grow I'm Bullish and  planning  on sticking with this one for a while especially with the new regimes.outlook on green energy. I see a large upside to this stock and plenty of  room. CPE is one of my odd buys. I picked  it up real cheap and its posted about a 100% increase I recently took profit and lowered my position because its price surge frankly worried  me a little. Looking at the charts less than 3 years ago it was touching 125 a share which would be nice. I dug and researched but couldn't find  a reason for its drastic drop in NOV 2019 does anyone know of any  reasoning for this I know petroleum stocks rise and fall a lot but from  nearly 125 to 60 and then down to 12 within 2 years sounds like a  bankruptcy. I'm pretty bullish on this stock though looking at the chart  and the historic highs there is plenty of room. PLUG I bought 4 years  ago in the single digits and offloaded for an overall loss (WHAT!) yeah I  pulled out before the growth even started but hindsight am I right if  only . PLUG is sitting at 60 today which is a good spot for it there are  a lot of opinions on PLUG I'll stick to mine. I'm holding 50 shares and  (even though I'm no bear) I don't think there is much more explosive  growth in PLUG's near future I think the fruit has been harvested and  profits taken. Overall there is a good place in the market for PLUG and  it will grow from 60 but there are better places I think that will  experience much more growth in the coming 2-3 years. We will see food for thought. Know of any others set to move in the energy sector I'm open for discussion

*****
> According to CFRA data that begins that year, the near 13% gain since Nov. 3 would be the biggest increase in the S&P 500 between the election and inauguration if the gains hold. President John F. Kennedy’s 8.8% gain had been the best, followed by President Dwight Eisenhower, with 6.3%, and President Donald Trump, with 6.2%.
*****
> Biden’s promise of the $1.9 trillion relief package he announced Thursday is one of the reasons for the stock market’s surge, and it will be a big focus of markets in the week ahead as investors handicap its chances of winning congressional approval.

> The Martin Luther King Jr. Day holiday starts off the week, and over the next four days several dozen S&P 500 companies report earnings. Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, IBM, Intel and Procter & Gamble are among the companies reporting.
*****
> # Biden will have no honeymoon
The $1.9 trillion stimulus package is at the top of the agenda. But there is also significant focus on whether his administration will be better at controlling the pandemic and rolling out the vaccine, as he has promised.
*****
> “This is the number he came in at. Where do negotiations go from here?” Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial, said of the $1.9 trillion package. She pointed to worries about a weakening economy, evident in December’s retail sales data, down a surprising 0.7%, and weekly jobless claims, at the worst level since August.
*****
> “You could argue this is Covid-related and therefore what is most important going forward is to see the logistics of the vaccines, inoculations gain orderly momentum. That is crucial for the market,” she said.

> “They want to see it go smoothly, and that there’s not any security lapse. The market absorbed the events of Jan. 6. The market looked ahead and figured out that at this point it was a one-off, and the market ended higher on Jan. 6,” she said. “But always the market becomes much more defensive if what we considered an isolated event suddenly broadens out.”
*****
> There will be heightened security surrounding the inauguration after a mob of Trump supporters assaulted the Capitol while Congress was in the process of confirming the Electoral College vote. The House last week voted to impeach Trump for inciting the mob, and now there is concern about further incidents in Washington or at state capitals.
*****
> # Stimulus and stocks
Markets are also watching carefully to see whether Biden can bridge some of the deep divide between Republicans and Democrats, who now hold a thin majority in Congress.
*****
> “We’re getting stimulus, and now the question is ‘OK, you’re supposed to be this great compromiser,’” said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA.
*****
> Political strategists expect Biden will get his stimulus package but it will be trimmed down. Ed Mills, Washington policy analyst at Raymond James, said the package could be cut to about $1 trillion based on the size previously discussed by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and outgoing Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.
*****
> “Does Congress want to have a bipartisan show of support after what has been an extraordinarily tenuous beginning of this year, to put it mildly?” Mills said. He said the stock market should continue to do well because it is going to get stimulus spending.
*****
> “D.C. is going to be there with more spending, or consumers are going to be there with more spending if they have the ability to get to a post-vaccine world sooner,” he said.
*****
> Stovall said that if history is a guide, the stock market should do well with Biden. The average gain of the S&P 500 in the first 100 days for Democratic presidents is 3.5%, going back to 1952. For Republicans in the same period, it’s been an average 0.5%.
*****
> The S&P 500 has also gained an average 11.3% in the first year of a Democratic president, but just 5.7% for Republicans, going back to World War II.
*****
> The stock market will continue to monitor the bond market, after the 10-year Treasury yield reached a high of 1.18% this past week, the highest since March. It since slid back to about 1.08% Friday after the weak data.
*****
> “Other things are going on in the back room. Bond yields have moved up of late, and it was a change. It gave you a sense of how fast rates can move,” said James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Leuthold Group. “It might be a preview of what you can expect this year.”

> # Martin Luther King Jr. Holiday Week Trading: Leans Bearish

> Although Martin Luther King Jr. Day was a holiday in many states and cities throughout the U.S. beginning in 1971, it did not become a federal holiday until 1986. Even then it was not observed by the NYSE until 1998. In the 23 years since, the market’s performance during this four-trading-day week has been somewhat lackluster with average weekly performance negative for DJIA, S&P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000. Average losses range from 0.81% by DJIA to 0.16% by NASDAQ. Of the five indexes, not one has a record better than 50/50. However, since 2012 performance has shown signs of improving. DJIA, NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have risen in six of the last nine years. S&P 500 and Russell 1000 have climbed in five of the last eight.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/67df4ce1594bee9748fb885a5316ff07/b5f21cb74511d020-c9/s500x750/218ed920ea1a67d95ff97fd05a5b9bbdf2454805.jpg))**

> # Seasonal Soft Patch Ahead Starting Next Week

> With nine trading sessions of the New Year complete, January and 2021 are off to a solid start. DJIA is up 1.26% as of today’s close, S&P 500 stands at 1.05%, NASDAQ 1.74% and small caps, measured by the Russell 2000 are up a whopping 9.14%. These gains all point to and confirm the return of seasonality that we have recently noted.

> Last September was weak as it has historically been, then October exhibited it historical tendency toward volatility while November and December were both positive, in line with typical seasonal patterns. A positive Santa Claus Rally and First Five Days are also encouraging indications that seasonal forces are once again tracking. We expect seasonality will continue to present itself going forward as extraordinary efforts are made to quell the pandemic and return to a pre-Covid, open-for-business, way of life.

> Due to the reemergence of seasonality, we would not be surprised to see some market weakness in the second half of January next week that could persist throughout the rest of January and possible spill over into February. In the following seasonal pattern chart of January, the last 21 years of data for DJIA, S&P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and 2000 have been plotted with January 2021 through today’s close plotted on the right vertical axis.

> Over the last 21 years, it has been NASDAQ leading at the halfway point, this year it is Russell 2000. Other than that, the major indexes have been tracking their historical patterns fairly well. There was strength early on, followed by sideways action. Should the current trend follow historical patterns then weakness after the eleventh trading day (January 18) is possible.

> # 5 Charts on the Democratic Blue Wave

> One of the top questions we’ve received recently has been what a blue wave may mean for investments. After the Democrats won the two Senate runoff elections in Georgia, they will now control the White House and both chambers of Congress. Our January 11 Market Policy Projections for 2021 gave some of the immediate and longer-term policy impacts of the Democratic “blue wave,” and here we surf the blue wave with some interesting charts.

> First off, blue waves have not been bearish for stocks, with the S&P 500 Index higher 6 of the past 7 times and up a respectable 9.1% on average since 1950.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Blog-1.15.21-1.png?ssl=1))**

> We shared this chart in 2020, and it shows that historically, stocks do better if an incumbent president wins versus a new president in office. This makes sense, as a new president will bring in new policies and likely question marks—while you know what you will get with a re-elected president. Remember, markets hate uncertainty and surprises.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Econ-blog-1.15.21-2.png?ssl=1))**

> “Make it all nine new Democratic presidents since 1900 to bring with them both the House and the Senate. In fact, stocks do quite well that first year under such circumstances, up nearly 12% on average,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Maybe investors shouldn’t fear a blue wave after all.”

> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, when a new Democratic president has brought with them the House and Senate, stocks gained that first year of their new presidency 6 of 8 times. What stands out to us for 2021, though, is the House majority is only 11—the smallest for a new Democratic president since 1900.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/blog-1.15.21-3.png?ssl=1))**

> Looking at all of the times the Democrats controlled the House (since the 35th Congress when it was Democrats and Republicans), the 11-seat majority is the lowest since 9 seats in 1879. Yes, the Democrats are in power, but this small majority will make it very tough for any of the more extreme policies to pass.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Econ-blog-1.15.21-4.png?ssl=1)**

> Lastly, the Senate is split a perfect 50/50, which is again extremely rare. In the chart below we share the seat difference between the two parties. “A 50/50 Senate coupled with only an 11-seat majority in the House, and it is safe to say we have about as close to a perfectly divided government as we’ve ever seen,” said Detrick.

> # Rest of the World Catching Up

> Over the past year, US equities—proxied by the S&P 500 (SPY)—have consistently outperformed global equities more broadly. As shown below, over the past year the S&P 500 (SPY) has risen just over 16%. That compares to 11.26% for the rest of the world as proxied by the Vanguard FTSE All-World ex US ETF (VEU). Breaking that down a bit further by developed and emerging markets, US equities have outpaced both emerging and other developed markets. While emerging markets (SPEM) are right on the heels of the US with just under a 14.78% gain, developed markets (SPDW) have lagged with just a 10.56% gain. So far in 2021, though, the rest of the world has been outperforming the US. Whereas SPY has risen around 1% YTD, VEU is up almost 3 times that. Emerging markets in particular have shown the greatest degree of strength currently having risen 3.87%. Meanwhile, SPDW has gained less (2.7%), though, it is still outperforming the US.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/011221-ETFs.png))**

> In the charts below, we show the ratio of SPY to these other ETFs. A rising line would indicate that the US is outperforming these other measures of global equities while a downward trending line indicates underperformance of SPY. As shown, the longer-term trend has pretty consistently been US outperformance over the past decade but that has faltered at the tail end of 2020 and into 2021. In the case of emerging markets, the line has been on the decline throughout the second half of 2020 as the ratio has hit its lowest level in a year in the past week. The S&P 500's underperformance relative to other developed markets (SPDW) has been more recent as that line peaked in early September but the trend remains the same over the past few months with SPY weaker than global equities more broadly. That is further exemplified by the recent downtrend of SPY versus the All World ex US ETF (VEU).

> # Small Business Owners Didn't Like the Election Results

> Today's release of the December Small Business Optimism Index from the NFIB saw a large drop as the index dropped from 101.4 to 95.9. After a sharp drop in the wake of the COVID outbreak, the index bounced back nicely but now looks like it's really rolling over.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/011221-NFIB-Small-Business-Chart.png))**

> Not only was this month's headline index weak, but it caught economists completely off guard. While the index fell to 95.9, economists were expecting a drop to 100.2. That 4.3 spread between the actual and expected reading was the biggest miss relative to expectations in more than five years (July 2015) and was the third weakest reading relative to expectations since the December 2012 report.

> Given the big drop in the headline index and the fact that it was so weak relative to expectations, should we be concerned about a double-dip? As an investor, we should always be worried about what could go wrong, but in the case of this report, you can probably wait for further confirmation from other data. The reason for the skepticism is that you could argue that politics plays a role in this report. To illustrate this, we would note that going back to 2010 (as far back as we have data) and right up through Election Day 2016, the NFIB only topped expectations 42% of the time. Following Trump's election in 2016, though, this index surged and has since topped expectations 63% of the time. Since Election Day 2020, though, the headline index has now missed expectations three times.

> From a longer-term perspective, dating back to 1974, the average reading of the NFIB Small Business Index during Republican administrations has been 100.1 while the average level under Democratic Presidents has been 96.2. Now, that would make sense if the economy was also in a recession more often in those periods, but over that same span, even though the percentages are low for both political parties (<20%), the economy has actually been in a recession a higher percentage of the time during Republican administrations than it has in Democratic administrations.

> The lesson to take from all this is that even if it's often hard to separate when it comes to business or investing (or a lot of other aspects of our lives for that matter), it's usually best to leave politics outside.

# DISCUSS!

What are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?

*****

I hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great week ahead r/stocks._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Aiming to finance my training - looking for advice Hello everybody!  


I would be really grateful for some advice on whats the best investment strategy for my current situation.  
Im a soon to be 27 year old employed person living in germany. My monthly income is decent as of now, I can easily put away 1000€ each month. Since the start of my employment I managed to safe around 15.000€. I plan to work another 14-16 months fulltime before I want to start a postgraduate Training to become a specialist in my field. The training alone costs around 20.000€ and takes \~3 years to finish. The pay in this period will not be great but if budgeded correctly, I can pay for my expenses.

What is my goal?

My goal is to make enough money in the next 14-16 months (together with what I already got), to pay my training and have a little bit extra for possible unforseeable expenses. I was thinking of investing the money in ETF's.  


Now to my question:   
What is the best investment strategy in my situation?   
Is DCA buying ETF's a good idea?  
If so, what ETF's do you suggest?  


Thanks for all the advice, have a great weekend!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ GME Longterm Do people on here truly believe this garbage company is going to turn around?  They have doing online preordering, purchasing and trade-ins for a while now.  They are basically going to be fighting for preorders/console orders with firms that either do things better or offer better warranty programs.  They will be (and are) fighting for game sales against digital pathways who have better rewards programs and offer incentives on purchase of newly released titles (Microsoft as an example).  Gamepass Ultimate with continual studio acquisitions and Sony is likely to follow in suit eventually in revamping plus and game services, but likely still won’t be on the same level.

People see disc versions of consoles being sold in market with limited supply and are trying to draw inferences from this.  Many people buy what they can find.  People also buy disc versions because of already having game libraries from before digital games were highly adopted/were a thing.  I personally plan to buy disc versions of both, but it’s not because I plan to buy new games on disc.  I have been buying digital for like 5 or more years.  There are only limited supplies of the super special ultimate physical collectors editions with special backpacks too for them to sell.

Do you really think the company, longterm, can exist if funko pop, peripherals, and vintage stuff which there is limited supply of?  Are NES, SNES and Genesis going to be the new gold standard and are notes going to be linked to them?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Short term gain taxes So i started investing on January 3rd, 2021, ever since then, i made about $2,060 in total. My question is, how much taxes will i pay in the next year's tax season if i made all of those profit from several different stocks after selling them. 

Does the IRS charge me a tax percentage on that total accumulated profit? or will they charge me a percentage each and everytime i sold a stock for profit in under a year?

Sorry i hope i didn't confuse yall.

Thanks in advance for the information yall can provide 🤙🏼

Have a great day. ✌🏽_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Time to stack up some $PLUG With 4th pedestal customer announcement coming likely before Plug's business conference on 26.1, this thing is headed for further growth to $80-$100 range.

JP got us a nice dip few days ago with $60 price target, however this was analyzed according to management's previous revenue guidance for 2024, a number that's likely to be increased significantly at the abovementioned conference.

Anyone who's followed the company also knows that  we'll soon get a contract with a large technology company, for their data centers' back up power solutions. You can google around which technology companies have recently tested hydrogen for back up power... 

Honestly the future is very exciting for this company and I'm happy Plug finally gets the recognition it deserves. The barriers of entry for this industry are very high so it seems inevitable Plug will be one of the biggest players around in a massive market._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ (DD) $ORBC IoT tech company with satellites My first DD so go easy on me. Originally for [r/wsb](https://www.reddit.com/r/wsb/) but market cap of 649.08M so can't post there.

The ticker is $ORBC which stands for Orbcomm. ORBC is an internet-of-things company(IoT) , so think connected devices talking with each other, but devices such as trailers, trucks, rail cars, sea containers, generators, fluid tanks, marine vessels, diesel or electric powered generators (gensets), oil and gas wells, pipeline monitoring equipment, irrigation control systems, and utility meters, in industries for transportation and supply chain, heavy equipment, fixed asset monitoring, maritime and government. Aka not your Amazon Alexa controlling your shower speakers while you're  on the toilet.

**Reasons to buy**:

1. Cathie Woods announced a few days ago that ARK is creating a new space ETF and $ORBC fits the criteria, this announcement I believe spurred the recent  price movement since $ORBC owns its own  satellite constellation.
2. $ORBC is owned by 70% institutional owners yet only has 600million market cap. I deem this as a signal of confidence for a small cap company.
3. $ORBC has been in a solid uptrend since October, from $4 to $8.25, and yet it only has 1.5k followers on StockTwits. Another stock that I follow that has made a similar move is $ENG, this stock has 15k followers, and my bby $PLUG has 110k followers. So, this indicates the hype train has yet to start.
4. Implied vol and historic vol are around the same level, so options are priced fairly, yet IV is relatively low, which indicates prices for the options are relatively cheap. Oh, and it also indicates the hype train has yet to start.
5. Fundamentals: EPS for the last two quarters is going up. Price/Sales and Price/Book are at or below sector average, and seems from TdAmeritrade it looks like $ORBC financial health is solid.
6. $ORBC just won an award for [best in class vehicle telematics for the year](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/01/12/2157332/0/en/ORBCOMM-Wins-2021-IoT-Breakthrough-Award-for-M2M-Vehicle-Telematics-Company-of-the-Year.html), so you can see there is potential exposure to the popular hightech vehicle sector rotation play. It also won the [2020 Unified Communications Excellence Award From Internet Telephony Magazine](https://www.nasdaq.com/press-release/orbcomm-wins-2020-unified-communications-excellence-award-from-internet-telephony) \-- whatever the fuck this award means -- but it shows that $ORBC has a product that speaks for itself. $ORBC has more awards but I'm not going to link them all.
   1. [$ORBC winds award that recognizes the leading providers of software and technology providers in the global food distribution industry](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/12/16/2146405/0/en/ORBCOMM-Named-to-Food-Logistics-2020-FL100-Top-Software-and-Technology-Providers.html)
7. $ORBC can also be a COVID distribution play. So, Biden recently griped that he couldn't meet his 100million vaccinated in his first 100 days, because his aids found out that mango's national strategy for actually delivering the vaccine was in shambles. So, he is pressuring his aids to somehow fix up months of screwups in a couple week, lol, so things are going to get aggressive in trying to meet logistical challenge of vaccine deliver. $ORBC has "*leadership and expertise in delivering end-to-end IoT transportation solutions make us a trusted partner for the world's leading pharmaceutical companies and express carriers who are expected to be distributing the COVID-19 vaccine and related medical supplies*", and so $ORBC is positioned to benefit from covid distribution. You can read more [here](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/orbcomm-poised-support-transportation-customers-143000206.html), the link specifically mentions that $ORBC has a product that allows real-time monitoring of temperature control and location of refrigerated shipments, ensuring visibility, security and integrity. I'm not saying that $ORBC has a contract with the Govt for covid distribution, but the CEO is hinting that he has something up his sleeve.
8. idk who revamped $ORBC media department but since December every few days there is some positive news, either a new deal or award. So you can expect some good pump days in the future.
9. The analyst recc is a strong buy with PT $10. I of course think $ORBC has meme worthy potential, but if you really want a price target then $25.
10. $ORBC is a good play for the lasting changes in economy from Covid. Companies who do not have IoT deployment need to travel to locate, diagnose and preset conditions on their assets, which is counter to the work-from-home trend. Btw Work-from-home will increase tech adoption in general  even after Covid.
11. $ORBC is also a holding of $KOMP ETF and  $HAIL ETF, as well as a small cap low volatility index, $SMLV

Also, what percent are you allowed to contribute to your Roth IRA? I know the max is $5500, but can you still max it out at $5500 if you weren’t making 50k a year? Or is it $5500 for everybody at all income levels?

Now when I look at the historical data of the stock there are no signs that it went below a dollar, and I sure as hell know that the stock was never as high as $80.

5 mistakes new investors make:

1. Learning from the wrong people - Focus on learning from those who are successful/profitable investors, with a long history of outperformance. Read everything written by people like Warren Buffet and Ray Dalio, learn about finance, economics, business and accounting. 

2. Risk management - Poor or lack of proper risk management protocols and procedures is sure to cause poor, or worse, negative performance. 

3. Investing emotionally - Investing requires complete emotional detachment and objective, logical and rational thinking.

4. Unrealistic expectations - The top investors make between 19% - 35% compounding annually over periods of 30-50 years. If you think you can beat those records, for the most part you’re delusional. 

5. Not knowing what you are buying - Focus within your circle of competence and make sure you have a deep and thorough understanding of what you own.

[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/kycznu)_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Ultimate buy and hold strategy? I was reading about buy and hold methods, I found one that looked interesting but I wanted to get some other opinions on it. The basic principle is buying diverse stable etfs so that if the market favors emerging markets or us small cap funds you profit the most. You buy into value and blends, US and international, large and small cap funds and always come out on top.

Here’s what they gave as an example:

10% VOO

10% VONV

10% VIOO

10% VIOV

10% VNQ+VNQI

10% VEA

10% VYMI

10% VSS

10% VWO

With Spotify up 140% since they started buying up Podcast companies and paying for celebrity podcasters, will this cause a big enough down turn in Spotify's share price to make it worth while buying? Citi have valued the shares at $310. Others have it rated between $315 and $380. What would you like to see them at to make them worthwhile buying?

This could be a good one to keep an eye on as it dropped on this assessment, closing at $320. With people working from home and not traveling as much, all podcasts have had a down turn in listeners. If the shares drop significantly during 2021, then it could be a good pick up to see a rebound in 2022-23 once Covid is more under control.

   * **Focus on their 5 segments in marketing**
      * the juggler, the innovator, the nester, the creative, and the minimizer
   * create **loyalty progams** to increase retention
* **Resetting Product Assortment**
   * Releasing BBBY's unique **private label brands** to penetrate the market and raise margin
   * increase the range of prices on products to invite lower spenders to the store

      * **the remodels are exactly what I wanted to see**
* **Creating stronger technology platform**
   * Better app and better website = more digital sales

As a BBBY shopper, **this addresses ALL my issues with the stores** atm.

As an investor, it's clear that **BBBY knows their audience and how they can regain market share and capitalize on their customers.**

Tritton clearly has a **GREAT vision** and **knows what he needs to do to** make it a reality.

REMEMBER this is a 3 year long plan, which means it will take time to fully come to fruition.

**If this is successful, BBBY will be a leader in the industry and the stock will reach highs unseen for years. With the leadership, I expect BBBY to successfully execute this plan, constantly top expectations, and prove the shorters wrong.**

Q3 Financials

* **Profitability**
   * Profit margin is at a **historically high level of 35%**
      * **10% increase YoY** lead by lowered payroll, improved promo management, and product mix
   * SG&A **lowered** by 41 million
* **Cash Flow and EBITDA**
   * **Cash flow of 244 million** compared to a **negative** cash flow last year
   * EBITDA **growth of 168% from -.38 cents to .08 cents**
* **Comp and digital Sales**
   * For the first time in 6 years, BBBY is showing comparable sales growth in the last 2 quarters
   * **Digital sales up 94%**
   * In store traffic **decreasing**
* **Market Share**
   * For the first time in ages, BBBY saw market shares growth in the Home and kitchen departments
   * Reversal of a negative trend in other departments
* **Cash and Debt**
   * Cash is increasing to a solid 1.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents
   * debt lowered by 500 million (25%) this year
* **Revenue and Net income**
   * Revenue is DECREASING by 5% YoY
      * Tritton closed TONS of low performing stores and will continue to do so
      * also sold failing businesses
      * this will hurt total revenue but raise net income
   * Net Income is INCREASING
      * lower performing stores gone means higher profits

Yes, earnings missed estimates, but as Tritton said, **he is doing everything he said he would do.**

**The balance sheet is improving, he is executing his plan steadily, and he is overall reassuring investors with his buybacks.**

BBBY is focusing on optimizing their top performing stores as the country is over satured with stores currently. With unprofitable stores closing, **we can expect a decreasing overall revenue, but an increasing net income.**

As the plan continues, I fully expect overall revenue to **reverse the trend, and begin increasing.**

Investors were also disappointed with guidance, but **Tritton has mentioned that he is being CONSERVATIVE in estimates**. He has always one to be conservative and deliver more than expected.

Tailwinds

* **Growing customer base**
* A general **shift towards home improvement**
* **New private label brands** are profitable and would help gain market share in 2021
* **150 stores** being remodeled in 2021
* **Stimulus** and perhaps more from Biden
* Return to "normal" would lead to a **large surge in marriages and babies**

Headwinds

* COVID worsening and restrictions returning
* **Twitter trying to get BBBY cancelled for selling MyPillow**

Buybacks

Normally, I am against share buybacks. BBBY used them previously to suppport a dying stock, but here it's different.

BBBY currently has an accelerated share repurchase program of 850 million dollars with 150 million to be repurchased by february 29th.

With excess cash from selling unprofitable businesses, **Tritton seeks to regain investor confidence WHILE producing obvious changes and results.**

Due to these buybacks, I expect share prices to grow over the next few months leading up to earnings.

Short Interest

Currently, short interest is astronomically high at \~70%. I believe that this has decreased as a hedge fund bearish on GME and BBBY seems to have covered at the same time.

Check the spike on GME and BBBY 1/13 11:30. It's likely Melvin or mapleridge covered a short position.

With Cramer pumping and this, we saw a mild squeeze, **but there are no more catalysts to cause another for a while;** however, with buybacks and strong performance, shorters will slowly buy back their shares alongside BBBY, causing **a steady rise in price in the following months.**

**If the turnaround plan is successful, shorts will have no reason to remain bearish, and BBBY will grow exponentially in price over the next 6-12 months.**

Conclusion

**Bed Bath and Beyond is on the road to success.**

**As a consumer, their private label brands, store remodels, and specialized marketing changes are exactly what I want to see.**

**In a growing industry, strong leadership, buybacks, and a beautiful turnaround plan make me bullish on BBBY.**

**I do NOT expect growth akin to what happened this week, but expect strong growth as the sentiment towards BBBY changes and their plan succeeds over the next few months.**

I am bullish on BBBY and will be until Tritton leaves

I'm interested to hear your thoughts_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ What is your 5, 10, 15 year goal? Obviously all of us are in the market to make a buck, but what is your 5, 10, 15 year goal for your portfolio? Do you want to hit a certain return rate? Retire early? Buy a house?

[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/kybitt)_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Trying to think critically the cycle of a short squeeze All this talk of the GameStop short squeeze had me thinking about shorting from a more critical standpoint. I always heard shorting was more risky because the amount a stock can go up is infinite (as opposed to 0 for call), and the convenient truth that the market has almost always trended up. 

I saw that short positions on GameStop are actually increasing in spite of the stock rally. That got me thinking of the full short cycle. My understanding is that a lender sells a short position to a buyer that has to return the shares by a specific date. The buyer buys the shares and immediately sells them. When they close the position they buy shares on the market and return them to lender. 

Who are the lenders for shares?  Could companies who have short positions also be lenders for new positions and buy them from themselves?  My thought is that if a squeeze starts to happen you could close out the newer short positions to give you more shares and list those on the market at lower price to close out some of your other positions.

Get ready for a potential overdue golden age for the nuclear energy industry, including but not limited to nuclear power plants and you guessed it: uranium.


**Let’s dig in deeper**

**Why Nuclear?**

Nuclear reactors generate virtually emissions-free power which means they can form a part of getting to net-zero emissions from electricity generation in the fight to tackle global warming.

**I thought nuclear equals bad?**

Unless you’ve been living under a rock, being green and sustainable is hot. There are currently no safe or clean ways to generate the amount of sustainable energy that nuclear does. Also, as the world population grows, unless there are giant leaps im technology, the only viable way to create enough power will be through a combination of nuclear, solar, wind and water.

**Biden’s administration has a $400 billion dollar sustainable energy proposal and it includes nuclear** 

This is rare. What’s even more rare is that he’s one of the only presidents to run on a platform *supporting advancement in nuclear energy.* He is serious about it. 

**That’s right, there’s a reason EVs mooned last year and will continue to do well for the foreseeable future. It’s the same reason there is potential for it to happen to the nuclear industry:**

https://www.tdworld.com/utility-business/article/21151832/president-bidens-vision-for-the-power-sector

**”But I’m republican. I can’t agree with Sleepy Joe...”**

You’re in luck! This is something so appealing that everyone and their racist grandma can hold hands and sing Kumbaya on. Bipartisan political handoff shows this is an opportunity area that even politicians can agree to.

**Even Nuclear industry folks seem highly positive in their world which has been fear mongered and neglected for decades:**

*"Things we've seen out of the Biden campaign and the transition team are very promising for a continuation and even acceleration of programs and policies that will support nuclear energy," said John Kotek, policy development vice president for the Nuclear Energy Institute*

I joined a trading discord with a relatively small community of "analysts." I had a free newcomer subscription and the allure of options pulled me in. I subsequently lost ~5k, which is quite a bit of money for me. The issue was I had no plan and failed to make use of stop losses. On top of that, I also ended up picking a handful of the losing trades. Fast forward to today, most of the positions I have are ETFs, with some stocks. Heavily weighted in tech, but my top positions are returning 80, 90, 100%. I've recuperated about 80-90% of my losses and I think going forward, I'm just going to build long positions and hold.

Edit: because some are asking about strategy regarding stop loss and what ETFs I'm in. If you haven't realized already from the above, I'm not an experienced trader and anything said here should be taken with a grain of salt... You need to understand your risk tolerance, technicals, and do your DD to know where to set your stop losses. If you see heavy support at a certain level, maybe set your SL there. But again it all depends on risk tolerance and what DD you do.

(chart included for reference) trying to learn and get better Last night I decided to buy into IPOF, so I woke up, logged into ToS and starting watching at the opening bell. I don't remember if I was looking at 5 min or 1 min but I included both for reference. Looking back the previous day it opened higher then ran down and basically traded sideways through afterhours.

It opened and started running upward and I placed a market order for $15.35. Then like it always seems to happen to me it started selling off and running down and hit a low of day at $14.3 then recovered and traded sideways again most of the day.

So my question is, what should I have done? Should I not have traded right at the bell in general? Should I have used the 1 min over the 5 min? I know I panicked and didn't want it to run up so I bought which was lack of discipline on my part but it also could have kept running up. Obviously I would have preferred to buy in at $14 so how could I have done better?
