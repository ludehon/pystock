 What happens with shares after a merger? I bought into $HCCH a little while ago and I have been seeing steady growth and been excited for the upcoming merger.

Today is the day of the four-hour Disney Investor Day Presentation!

They've also mentioned that the likes of Pixar, Lucasfilm, and Marvel Studios will have new projects revealed (whether that means stuff that the trades have reported on or something new remains to be seen), the last of which is highly relevant to here.

You can watch the presentation [right here](https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/disney-investor-day-2020/).

Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Co. bought $100 million of bitcoin for its general investment account, the latest sign of mainstream acceptance for the upstart digital currency.

The investment is a tiny one for the Springfield, Mass.-based insurance company whose general investment account totaled nearly $235 billion as of Sept. 30. But it signifies further momentum for bitcoin, [which has surged this fall](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bitcoin-is-back-trading-near-three-year-highs-11604250000?mod=article_inline). The price of a single bitcoin peaked in late November at $19,835, topping its 2017 high, and currently trades around $18,000, up 150% year-to-date.

MassMutual purchased the bitcoin through a New York-based fund management company called NYDIG, which has about $2.3 billion of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies under management. MassMutual also acquired a $5 million minority equity stake in NYDIG, which was formerly known as New York Digital Investment Group.

The insurance company, founded in 1851, said the bitcoin investment was based on a broad strategy to take advantage of new opportunities while remaining diversified, “giving us measured yet meaningful exposure to a growing economic aspect of our increasingly digital world.”

Bitcoin, [launched in January 2009](https://www.wsj.com/articles/BL-DGB-26847?mod=article_inline), is a software program that operates across a network of linked but independent computers. It allows any two people to exchange value directly without the use of a middleman like a bank.

Ross Stevens, the founder and executive chairman of NYDIG, said other return-hungry insurance companies have also bought bitcoin for their general accounts through his firm. Interest rates that are hovering near zero and a depreciating dollar have made bitcoin appear more attractive, he added.

Bitcoin’s rally has attracted momentum investors who pile into the market’s biggest winners and sell the losers, [along with billionaire investors](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bitcoin-trades-again-near-record-driven-by-new-group-of-buyers-11606127401?mod=article_inline) like Paul Tudor Jones and Stanley Druckenmiller who have publicly disclosed bitcoin investments in recent months.

Among other companies jumping into the market, payments firm Square Inc. bought $50 million of bitcoin in October for its corporate treasury. It has allowed users of its Cash App to buy and sell bitcoin since 2018.

Tech company [MicroStrategy](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/MSTR) Inc. has become an even more vocal proponent of the digital currency, investing about $425 million this year. The company on Wednesday detailed an offering of up to $550 million in convertible bonds, with the intention of using the proceeds to buy bitcoin.

Despite the recent renewed interest, bitcoin remains a tiny market, which contributes to its notorious volatility. Its price fell as low as $3,867 in March, when global markets cratered, a drop of more than 60% from the beginning of 2020. Bitcoin also lost about 50% of its value in January 2018 after its spectacular 2017 run.

Thanks._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Understanding MMEDF and NASDAQ uplisting ([x-post](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/kaj1n7/mmedf_and_nasdaq_uplisting_due_diligence/) from /r/stocks bc I got no answers there)

MindMed (NEO: MMED, OTC: MMEDF), a psychedelics therapeutics research company, recently [applied for listing on the NASDAQ](https://mindmed.co/news/press-release/mindmed-submits-application-for-nasdaq-up-listing-appoints-canaccord-genuity-as-financial-advisor/). The stock has been on quite a run lately, but I suspect NASDAQ uplisting would be a catalyst for much more upside (based on the large new investor pool now able to buy the stock and extra legitimacy given by NASDAQ listing).

I want to understand the chances that MindMed actually gets uplisted. The process "generally takes four to six weeks to process a listing application," to quote the [NASDAQ listing requirements](https://listingcenter.nasdaq.com/assets/initialguide.pdf), but MindMed applied (with Canaccord Genuity Corp. as financial advisors) on September 21, according to their press release. That's about 10 weeks ago. However, according to the **Market Value of Listed Securities Standard** (page 10 of the linked doc) for the NASDAQ Capital Market, MMEDF should pass all of the requirements:

* Stockholders' Equity ($4 million required, $19.6 million in latest earnings report)
* Market Value of Publicly Held Shares ($15 million required, $690 million as of today, Dec 10, 2020)
* Market Value of Listed Securities ($50 million required, $767 million as of today, Dec 10, 2020)
* Unrestricted Publicly Held Shared (1 million required, 243 million as of today, Dec 10, 2020)
* Round Lot Shareholders (300 required, I don't have numbers for this but have no doubt there are orders of magnitude more than this)
* Market Makers (3 required; I don't have a number for this, but given the volume recently, this must not be a problem)
* **This is the big one:** Bid Price or Closing Price (either $4 bid or $2 close; the closing price has been above $2 **since Monday, Dec 7**)

The lower $2 closing price standard can be used instead of the higher $4 bid standard if the company has net tangible assets more than $5 million; MMEDF has $18 million in cash alone. I'm using earnings data from [here](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MMEDF/balance-sheet#figure_type=quarterly) and share ownership data from [here](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MMEDF).

I'm considering significantly increasing my position in MMEDF if it seems like this uplisting is a safe bet, since I think this thing will pop if the listing is approved. My questions are:

* Is the only reason the uplisting hasn't been approved the fact that the share price hasn't closed above $2 for enough days? Or have I missed another reason why MMEDF doesn't meet uplisting requirements?
* Is there precedent for NASDAQ rejecting a company that seemingly meets all of the listed requirements?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Portfolio currency hedging Hi all, I am based in Europe and the majority of my portfolio is in USD.

I posted this on Tuesday at /wallstreetbets but I figured I'd spread the word.

Those of you who bought SNOW earlier have been seeing a lot of green numbers lately, which is great with this astronomical price but I hope you realise only 10% of total shares (24M out of 240M) are currently in float.

The rest is held by founders, employees, like CEO Frank Slootman who has a share strike price of $8.88 (he only came in April 2019 so you can be sure there are plenty of people in the company with cheaper stock options) and exclusive investors who were offered to buy it before the IPO for a maximum of $120 a share. Now those remaining 90% of shares are currently in lock up period but the first 11M of those are gonna be unlocked on Monday, Dec 14 and there's most likely gonna be a fire sale at these returns. 15 days after that, if the price holds above $160 for 10 of 15 consecutive days, another 37M shares are unlocked, which means triple the float by January and all of those people bought it for pennies compared to retail investors.

I strongly recommend Steven Fiorillo's article on Seeking Alpha from Tuesday, which goes in depth to analyse the fundamentals and valuation.

Snowflake is a fine company with potential but is worth nowhere near current insane levels, even if you drink their marketing kool aid. And if you're thinking if Warren Buffet bought it, it's good enough for me, then rest assured Berkshire most likely paid less than $120 for a share.

Facebook  ([**FB**](https://www.thestreet.com/quote/fb)) - [Get Report](https://secure2.thestreet.com/cap/prm.do?OID=033365&ticker=FB) faces little risk from the antitrust lawsuit the Federal Trade Commission filed against the social media giant, several analysts said. 

Shares of the Menlo Park, Calif., social-media giant at last check were little changed at $277.88.

The FTC and most states [filed an antitrust lawsuit](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/facebook-slips-after-ftc-files-antitrust-lawsuit-to-breakup-tech-giant), charging that the company engaged in anticompetitive behavior to maintain a monopoly position in personal social networking.

KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst Justin Patterson said he was struggling with "why a breakup -- a process that could take years given technical complexities -- should take place."

"Instead, we believe this will likely be resolved with another fine and additional scrutiny on future M&A," said Patterson, who rates the stock overweight with a $340 price target.

[The FTC alleges that Facebook](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2020/12/ftc-sues-facebook-illegal-monopolization) undertook a years-long effort to maintain a monopoly through anticompetitive acquisitions and actions that target potential and nascent rivals.

The commission is demanding that Facebook unwind the acquisitions of photo-focused network Instagram and messaging app Whatsapp. 

"We believe Facebook’s virtual ownership of the social graph, strong competitive moat, and focus on the user experience position it to become an enduring blue-chip company built for the long term," J.P. Morgan analyst Doug Anmuth said.

Anmuth, who rates Facebook overweight with a $330 price target, said that "Facebook is in rarefied air across the combination of scale, growth, and profitability, as the company’s massive reach and engagement continue to drive network effects, and its targeting abilities provide significant value to advertisers."

Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter said that while there is certainly merit to the FTC’s allegations that Facebook strengthened its competitive position” when it bought Instagram and WhatsApp, the firm is “skeptical that the FTC will prevail,” as it is difficult to see how Facebook “precluded competition.”

“We can only conclude that the FTC suit is intended to make headlines,” Pachter said, adding that he was skeptical "that a federal court will compel a divestiture, and equally skeptical that a divided Congress will pass a law that forces such a result.”

Baird analysts said in a note that the complaint has some bark but “little bite.” 

“We do not see much in the way of ‘teeth’ in today’s FTC/states complaint about Facebook,” Baird said, adding that  there is “very little likelihood that punitive recommendations to split the company will occur.”_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ CD Project (OTGLY) (Cyberpunk 2077) OTGLY went public on the 10th of november at $25.46.

Important parts 

 \- Among the get-rich-quick toxins that poisoned the mind of the investing public in the 1990s, one of the most lethal was the idea that you can build wealth by buying IPOs

 \- We all want to buy “the next Microsoft”—precisely because we know we missed buying the first Microsoft. But we conveniently overlook the fact that most other IPOs were terrible investments.

 \- most of the high returns on IPOs are captured by members of an exclusive private club—the big investment banks and fund houses that get shares at the initial (or “underwriting”) price, before the stock begins public trading. 

 \- **If, like nearly every investor, you can get access to IPOs only after their shares have rocketed above the exclusive initial price, your results will be terrible. From 1980 through 2001, if you had bought the average IPO at its first public closing price and held on for three years, you would have underperformed the market by more than 23 percentage points annually.**

Among the get-rich-quick toxins that poisoned the mind of the investing public in the 1990s, one of the most lethal was the idea that you can build wealth by buying IPOs. An IPO is an “initial public offering,” or the first sale of a company’s stock to the public. At first blush, investing in IPOs sounds like a great idea—after all, if you’d bought 100 shares of Microsoft when it went public on March 13, 1986, your $2,100 investment would have grown to $720,000 by early 2003. And finance professors Jay Ritter and William Schwert have shown that if you had spread a total of only $1,000 across every IPO in January 1960, at its offering price, sold out at the end of that month, then invested anew in each successive month’s crop of IPOs, your portfolio would have been worth more than $533 decillion by year-end 2001.

Unfortunately, for every IPO like Microsoft that turns out to be a big winner, there are thousands of losers. The psychologists Daniel Kahnerman and Amos Tversky have shown when humans estimate the likelihood or frequency of an event, we make that judgment based not on how often the event has actually occurred, but on how vivid the past examples are. We all want to buy “the next Microsoft”—precisely because we know we missed buying the first Microsoft. But we conveniently overlook the fact that most other IPOs were terrible investments. You could have earned that $533 decillion gain only if you never missed a single one of the IPO market’s rare winners—a practical impossibility. Finally, most of the high returns on IPOs are captured by members of an exclusive private club—the big investment banks and fund houses that get shares at the initial (or “underwriting”) price, before the stock begins public trading. The biggest “run-ups” often occur in stocks so small that even many big investors can’t get any shares; there just aren’t enough to go around. 

If, like nearly every investor, you can get access to IPOs only after their shares have rocketed above the exclusive initial price, your results will be terrible.

[Degiro's screenshot](https://ibb.co/T0J5TYT)_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Stock Market Tickers To Watch Thursday, 12/20/2020 My plays for December 10, 2020,

I use: 10, 50, & 200EMA. MACD, Stochastic, and RSI as indicators - all on the 180D, 4H chart)

**$AGEN** \- This is a down trending stock, do not get this twisted. But the channel down is amazingly structured. It is curling back up; and it has done it 4 times now in this channel. If this holds, this is an easy 5% at least, if not closer to 17%. RSI was recently oversold, Stochastic is finally curling, and the MACD crossed. All adding up for a win tomorrow.

**$ALNY** \- We have a channel from the last 6 months developing, and at this price point - it has been very successful. $124.00 reversals have had a 100% success rate over 5 times now, but the profits are lower every time. It is coiling for a big move. I would go long if it shows any life tomorrow, easiest 6% - 15% you'll have.

**$BBY** \- This is a strong support area, it has not gotten this low in 4 months, and always hold here. It reversed today so just go long and have a reasonable stop lose. Was oversold, stochastic curled, MACD is finally moving up. Super simple read and play here.

**$BIG** \- $BIG has this channel, $45 to about $43; where it reverses beautifully. Was just oversold, Stochastic bottomed out, and now it is off! If it breaks both 50 and 200EMA lines, it is going to go stuuuuupid.

**$BKI** \- Bouncing off of the 200EMA lines which is also paired with a strong support area. If it bounces you'll see a very clean 11% right here, Oversold as well; such an easy read. here.

**$BLD** \- One of the easiest channels you'll see since $FL last week. 200EMA bounce, support, with a channel?! GO LOOOOONG.

**$COR** \- IF $COR goes from $118 to $117, you win. This channel is that strong, it has not broken this low in months -- and the best moves are 30%, easy. Buy now... Like pre market tomorrow...

**$EXR** \- Suuuuuch a beautiful channel up with such strong success, that is coupled with the 200EMA line. It is also at a support area, and Stochastic looks good for a push. Such an easy read and setup.

**$GALT** \- Read my description of $COR, and apply it to this from $2.60 to $2.53, what a beautiful channel here y'all.

**$HAS** \- Loooong term ascending trendline, and at a support area here. IF it lives, go long because you'll make easy 8% - 10% on this one. Worst case, it dies and we have a brand new horizontal channel that we can abuse. But Indicators show a time for a reversal here.

**$NEW** \- Step down, channel, step down channel; rinse - wash - repeat. That is what $NEw is doing. This channel though is strong and if it breaks this downtrend, it is going to go mental. This is also a great deal for the price point and potential.

**$RESN** \- Read $COR and $GALT, same thing for a penny stock._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ WeedMaps going public via SSPK SPAC https://www.reuters.com/article/weedmaps-ma-silver-spike-acq/cannabis-review-site-weedmaps-to-go-public-at-1-5-bln-valuation-idUSL4N2IQ2NW

I don't Airbnb, sounds like a unicorn company for vacation rental online marketplace, has its own problem with this special business. The biggest issue I think, is that the most service they provide is Consumer to Consumer, which means Airbnb is hard to control both sides' behavior.

The last time I used Airbnb was in 2018 and it was terrible. After that, I decided to book rooms in any other places but not on this website anymore. PS: I've only used Airbnb 4 times and I have to say none of them was perfect.

Back to my worst experience, there were several things the landlord did:

1. On Airbnb, the landlord required $300 for deposit and asked me to pay her through Paypal.

2. I could not move in the day I want and had to check in one day later. And I paid $100 for the hotel.

3. The room I reserved was taken by another renter.

4. Someone broke into the house during I lived in and I called the police. The house cannot provide safety and it was a nightmare. I had to move out with my friends for several days.

5. No wifi for the last month I lived in. I told her so many times and she never responded. I had to pay $60 for myself.

6. She was always suspicious that I brought others to stay overnight which I did not. Of course, she had no evidence but she always wanted to charge me extra money for that. 

7. The landlord never actually lived in the house. She asked help with her house, like roof leaking, bulb changing, sending mails to Florida, etc. And she did not pay me for the shipment.

8. She requested me to write a good review for her.

9. She wanted to make the personal contract, not through Airbnb.

10. Low down the rent and changed the policies after I moved in. She did not tell me and keep charging me the high price until I found out. The changing policies also included, like no more deposit, free cancellation, etc.

11. She is very quick to reply with questions initially... until there were issues. Did not answer texts, phone calls and the voice mailbox was full.

12. Of course, I never get my deposit back.

Until now, I still didn't get a certain response from Airbnb. 

Also, besides the problems from landlords, I know Airbnb also cannot prevent the wrong behavior from the renters(not me).

&#x200B;

I followed $SLS for half a year ago, posted DD here and just waited till this inevitable moment. Yesterday, the madness began and believe me, it's just starting. This company is still EXTREMELY undervalued and $SLS will hit $20 MINIMAL at the end of the year and that's even way too conservative. It's just to show you that anything under $20 a share for $SLS is a BARGAIN.

$GLSI is a sister company of $SLS, because they are specified in the same field: Breast Cancer Medicine. But here is the trick: the medicine of $SLS is WAY more effective than $GLSI's medicine. The Market Cap of $SLS is still 60 Million and that's NOWHERE near their deal with China that's worth 200 MILLION. I haven't even talked about their other extremely effective medicines in their pipeline and that the fear of dilution is gone now, because they just solved all their money problems.

I have researched this company already half a year ago, I know the value of this company and we're nowhere near it. I will hold to at least the end of the year. Don't sell too early, this is a goldmine.

This is an early Christmas present for you guys!

Airbnb has priced its IPO at $68 per share. 

[https://www.wsj.com/articles/airbnb-expected-to-price-ipo-above-56-to-60-a-share-range-11607527468?mod=hp\_lead\_pos6](https://www.wsj.com/articles/airbnb-expected-to-price-ipo-above-56-to-60-a-share-range-11607527468?mod=hp_lead_pos6)

In all likelihood, the stock will open much higher than that. I think Airbnb is a great potential long term buy given that it's IPOing at the worst possible time for travel industry in general. This was the toughest year for Airbnb. Contrast this with DoorDash which had the best year because everyone was avoiding going out. Wall Street is short-sighted. It only sees 2020 revenues and makes foolish decisions. You can be smarter than that. Would you want to invest in a company about to become a travel behemoth and had the worst possible year and and only has good things to look forward to or would you invest in a food-delivery company whose pandemic-fueled, covid-inspired best year is already behind it.

Airbnb has already received a couple upgrades before the IPO.

A conservative firm like Airbnb was valuing Airbnb at $53B - $65B back in 2018.

https://twitter.com/virgingalactic/status/1336822653869494274?s=20_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ My bear case for DoorDash \- DoorDash has grown because of Covid. When that ends, people will go back to work (and order less), go to grocery stores more (and order less) and importantly, go out to eat (and order less). DoorDash is a growth company, and when growth slows, that hurts the perception.

\- DoorDash has gotten to some semblance of reduced losses due to its ability to pool order deliveries. That goes out the window pretty quickly if volumes, especially suburbs go down. - DoorDash’s DashPass deals with Chase are coming to an end in the next few months. Am I really going to be buying DashPass, I doubt it.

\- DoorDash has 1 business line - food delivery. Uber has Rides (highly profitable), Eats (not shabby but not great), micro mobility (ok ok) etc. DoorDash is a worthy competitor, but it is not worth anywhere close to Uber. Don’t let the market tell you otherwise

\- DoorDash has been charging merchants 30%, mostly because restaurants don’t have much of a choice. That changes quickly when traffic returns to dine-ins. And if there’s one thing that DoorDash has always won on, it's their wide range of selection.

Why not just wait for a merger deal or rumor of a merger deal and sell the initial pop? I feel like I'm missing something here...  


From my understanding, SPACs commonly IPO at $10, and because the money from shares sold go into a trust, it doesn't really drop below $10 in case a merger doesn't happen.  


SPACS are popping up all over the place this year... especially in bubble categories like electric vehicles. These SPACs also tell people what type of business they are looking to merge with beforehand.  


Why wouldn't I just find a SPAC that is looking to merge with some current hyped industry (EVs, cloud computing, blockchain, etc) throw tons of money into at around $10, and just sell the moment a rumor occurs that they are in talks to merge with someone?  


Even if I wait until AFTER rumors occur, and the price goes up to $11 or $12... it seems my investment risk is pretty low, as the price will only drop back to around $10, and if a merger never ever happens I get my initial investment back.
