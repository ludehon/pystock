 Time to talk cyclicals. I know the next few months are uncertain for financial and real estate stocks, but with vaccines coming out, investors might start to price in some optimism. The real big drivers for these two industries are the kinds of things that are reflected by an ‚Äúgood economy‚Äù in the most textbook sense. If there‚Äôs any hint at all that banks can start to take more aggressive interest rates and real estate firms to expect new tenants, it might reflect in these stocks. 

Regardless, Truist has just gone through some acquisitions with Sunbank and CBRE is experiencing and live sciences boom in their warehouse commercial properties in large research areas such as SD and Boston. Two moves that should fare well with hopes of returning to business as usual.

Position: 5 - 50c 12/18_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Soros Regrets Early Investment in Peter Thiel‚Äôs Palantir - Bloomberg _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ The Earnings Paradox Hey guys I have a theory that I'd like to present:

Earnings will cause a stock price to drop. Sound crazy? Let me explain:

Suppose a company beats expected earnings. The value of that company goes up, and the share prices should go up. But the amount of people looking to capitalize on these strong earnings by selling the stock will drill the stock back down, perhaps even lower than it was pre earnings. We saw this quite a few times this fall (I wish I could remember the stocks I saw this with but I'm sure a few of you also noticed this).

Now of course, if a company absolutely blows their earnings expectations out of the water, and it causes a lot of people to jump on board out of FOMO, the stock would have a lasting increase due to earnings date. But considering how accurate earnings expectations are these days, I don't see this happening very often.

I can already hear all the counter examples and people hating on this post. But that's okay, this is a discussion.

TSLA 465C 11/20_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ SRAC and Momentus Space Alright fellow degenerates, listen up. We all know SPACs are all the rage right now. SPAC is only one letter away from space - this is a sign. Stable road acquisition (SRAC) is merging with Momentus Space, likely to be finalized in ‚Äúearly 2021.‚Äù Momentus is angling to provide delivery vehicles to move satellites launched by SpaceX and other launch companies to their final orbit. 

Recent article calls it the fedex of space, delivering packages the final mile whether that is low earth orbit or moon orbit. But this is just the beginning. Momentus wants to also provide ongoing support to satellites in orbit with refueling, positioning, and deorbiting of existing satellites. Bigger picture they aim to provide vehicles for human exploration and exploitation of the solar system - including mining on the moon and asteroids. Love exploration but fuck that, we want exploitation here. Gimme tendies or gimme death. 

In addition to this, their fuel is not pressurized liquid oxygen but plain ass water which is highly abundant in space. SRAC shares only $10 right now and options are cheap. Not only is this a company with massive growth opportunity in a market that will inevitably grow but it also could be a meme stock as it is one of the only space plays out there. Get in now for literal rides to the moon üöÄüöÄüöÄ

Edit: Fuck you guys I didn‚Äôt know it was after hours_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ NVAX as mRNA vaccines are not safe Both PFE and MRNA have produced mRNA vaccines. The way these vaccines work is that they inject a mRNA segment coated with a protein sheath. The protein sheath gets the mRNA inside our healthy cells. The protein factories in these cells read the mRNA and produce the spike protein and die in the process. As they die they release the spike protein into the blood stream. Now our immune system sees the spike protein and creates antibodies to the spike protein. Later when the SARS COV2 virus enters the body the antibodies attack the virus as they already recognize the spike protein as bad.

Now compare with traditional vaccines  - we introduce a dead or weakened form of the virus. Immune system recognizes the virus and creates antibodies.

Now compare NVAX vaccine. No mRNA or virus is introduced. Instead the spike protein is grown in vats and the spike protein is injected. Immune system sees the spike protein and creates antibodies.

So why do I think the NVAX approach is better than the mRNA or traditional approach

Traditional approach takes time - years to create a weaker form of the virus so NVAX beats that from a time perspective

But the mRNA approach really scares me. We are taking over the cell machinery of healthy cells and turning them into virus protein factories. What happens when something goes wrong in the process?

Say the cell we are taking over already is infected with HIV. The cell factories are busy turning out copies of HIV. Now we infect it with the mRNA and it starts producing spike proteins. Random mutations do happen especially when creating proteins and viruses foreign to our system. Say randomly a copy of the HIV virus gets created with the COV2 spike protein attached. The spike protein is what makes COV2 so infectious so now we have a virus with the infectiousness of Covid and the deadliness of AIDS and this "vaccinated" individual is walking around shedding this virus. Which means HIV could be transmitted through the air.

Another scenario - autoimmune disorders. In people who suffer autoimmune disorders like lupus or arthritis the immune system gets confused and attacks our own cells. Well now we are adding to the confusion. We are changing cells in our own body to create a foreign protein. What if the immune system instead of creating immunity to the spike protein creates immunity to our own cells. Our own antibodies start killing off cells in our own brain. We have created early onset Alzheimers. Sure these folks will seem to be protected from COVID in vaccine trials of 2-3 months duration but 2-3 years down the line they wont be able to remember their own name or use the bathroom without help.

mRNA vaccines are just too dangerous which is why the technology has been stuck for 10 years. No way to know its safe wthout large scale and long term trials and no way to ethically justify such a trial (except of course if you are in the middle of a pandemic)

So mRNA could work but also PFE and MRNA and CVAC could get sued into bankruptcy a few years from now (And now you understand why the Republicans are desperate to get liability shield for COVID treatment into any Stimulus package. Without such a package passing neither MRNA nor PFE will actually start vaccination)

NVAX nanoparticle vaccine avoids the risk of autoimmune disorders or frankenstein viruses. Plus they dont need a specialized cold chain.

Finally the CanSino, Sputnik and AZN vaccines use a genetically modified common cold virus to produce the spike protein. It wont work for anyone who has already had the common cold as the delivery vector will get destroyed before it has a chance to takeover cells to produce the spike protein due to their eisting immunity to the Adenovirus vector.

India is working on a traditional vaccine but that will take at least another 18 months

&#x200B;

So from a speed, logistics and safety perspective NVAX has the best vaccine._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Boys in UK/ Europe, avoid Trading 212. Particularly on their CFD platform.

Checking between their live feed and Stocks app, the data lags and hesitates before rising. No such problem on the way down of course!

Have not worked out their ‚Äòinterest rate‚Äô if you hold a CFD position overnight, but that seems high as well.

Finally, whatever your screen shows as ‚ÄôResult‚Äô on a position, they always execute for a point or two less, snatching between ¬£60 and ¬£100 on what you actually end up with.

Step 2: Sell 2 week DTE $10.5 OTM calls to beta WSB degens for 4.5% premium

Step 3: Collected said premium, option expires worthless. Cream inside your wife.

Step 4: Repeat step 2

Step 5: PLTR goes from $10 to $11.88 on Thursday before expiration. I unwind feeling good but figure $11.88 is too high a basis for me to go back to Step 1.

Step 6: PLTR rips 16% on Friday....and goes absolutely nuclear. Currently trading at $18.5

Step 7: Use my proceeds from step 3+5 to pay my classmate to fuck my gf.

Anyone? _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ [YOLO] Huge disruption in the Alcohol Industry, TAP to the MOON After a brief hiatus from WSB, I am back, not to consume the content you guys are creating, but to give you guys some crazy news from inside the alcohol industry. What is it?

  
HARD SELTZER. 

&#x200B;

Your White Claw pal that cannonballed into the industry and is now causing a slow bleed of traditional beer, wine, and spirits producers. From a US market size of only not very many million less than 5 years ago, hard seltzer market is now worth over $4 Billion in 2020. 4 BILLION IN GROWTH OF MARKET SIZE. Anyone making hard seltzer can't keep up with demand.

[https://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/article/2020/hard-seltzer-defies-categorization-and-limits-as-the-most-resilient-alcohol-segment-in-u-s/](https://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/article/2020/hard-seltzer-defies-categorization-and-limits-as-the-most-resilient-alcohol-segment-in-u-s/)

&#x200B;

White claw holds #1 market share, but its private. Boston Beer Company holds #2 with their Truly brand, but their market share is slipping to new entrances from Coors, Natural Light, and new brands.  Boston Beer stock popped off but is now slipping back down. Truly also doesn't look and taste like the perfect brand either. IMO, Bud Hard Seltzer is the best new entrance, but BUD STOCK may be too large to get that BIG UPSIDE from the hard seltzer market.

[https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/big-brewers-pop-top-on-new-hard-seltzer-brands-in-2020-56743493](https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/big-brewers-pop-top-on-new-hard-seltzer-brands-in-2020-56743493)

&#x200B;

Next time you go to the convenience store or grocery store, note the new COORS HARD SELTZER now being sold. TAP stock has been having a good time, and their EPS is hovering around 1.76, signifying that they are still a value stock. I see them rising from the ashes through the new years and through 2021, as food and bev sales in retail store has increased a lot due to boredom and less outdoor sales. 

&#x200B;

Hard seltzer is getting a massive boost in new generational health drinkers, closing down of pubs and breweries, and amazing 'new' marketing that's gender non-specific. This $4 billion market is showing NO SIGNS of slowing down, forecasted to break $10 billion in 5 years. Get in before there's too much hype. I'm putting my last 3k for the ride.

&#x200B;

TLDR; Hard Seltzer market chugging on like a train. TAP 12/31 $47 YOLO._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ TGT Disc. TGT announces earnings tomorrow (11/18) and it seems like positive results are a given.

Paragraph that caught my eye and confirms my GME bullish bias

Friedman: You were rejected by 100 different investors. What did you learn from the process? What made you keep going when you kept hearing no?

Cohen: For me, each no sounded like they just didn‚Äôt understand my vision. It was frustrating at times, but never discouraging. Those ‚Äúno‚Äùs never made me doubt my strategy ‚Äì it was the opposite. I was motivated by all the rejections and they just got me fired up.

Most investors couldn‚Äôt get past two hurdles: competing head-on with Amazon and the pets.com failure during the dot com bubble. But I was convinced being focused on the pet category along with high-touch customer service gave Chewy unique competitive advantages. Pets.com was a good idea but a decade too soon and without sufficient scale to cover their costs. These two hurdles didn‚Äôt scare me. I never considered changing my business plan. One highly respected venture capitalist told me he would be more interested if we were selling live pets over the internet rather than pet supplies. Like most investors, he believed running into Amazon‚Äôs teeth was suicidal.

I understood that thinking big was likely going to be misunderstood along the way. I‚Äôm contrarian by nature, so being misunderstood often validates what I‚Äôm doing. It wasn‚Äôt until Chewy boxes were on doorsteps across the country that the bulk of investors started to recognize our formula.

Some of you might recall a panic post about my Robinhood account getting hacked. They wiped me clean. I posted on here after contacting Robinhood support. They got back to me a couple of times but now it‚Äôs been a while since I heard back. FYI: 2FA doesn‚Äôt save you. Idk if I‚Äôm the first or it just hasn‚Äôt been heard of yet. I simply woke from a nap, saw the notifications that everything was getting sold and then withdrawn.

My only questions out of serious curiosity is has anyone seeing this been hacked before? And is there such thing as Robinhood giving them positions back?

What is happening today is just a prelude.  If you read the announcement:  " Due to the large size of the addition, S&P Dow Jones Indices is seeking feedback through a consultation to the investment community to determine if Tesla should be added all at once on the rebalance effective date or in two separate tranches ending on the rebalance effective date ".  What this means is that the firms that need to buy shares in TSLA as part of the S&P 500 \*\*do NOT KNOW\*\* how much or when they need to buy shares yet, AND inclusion is on Dec 21, so there is nearly a month before inclusion happens.  

This is important, as the share movement so far has likely been only a small fraction of what will be happening in the next few weeks.  We ain't seen nothing yet.  Once S&P announces how they want to handle things, expect all hell to break loose._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Forever going to be chasing this high on every play from now on _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ I don‚Äôt know much about omens but I‚Äôm pretty sure this ain‚Äôt a good sign _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $PSTH Institutional Holding's Highlights Review You love to see it: ü¶Ñ

In looking at the price, effectively he stated that you never knew the world was in the middle of a pandemic.  If you have roku, just load up cnbc, and watch the segments, his dissertation of sorts leads one to believe that irrational behavior can ONLY be described if an irrational person acts rationally.  In short, retail has come to the rescue, NOT THE FED, and retail is buying high, and buying higher.  Call it FOMO, but there is rationale here.  Really you can make a market like this work if and ONLY if we are willing to buy at any level.  

Takeaway, calls!  You can get on your high-horse with technicals, and that's all fine and good.  Stop looking at valuation, don't think too hard, just think what this forum can do.  Who needs the value shift, just need to be willing to buy.

It was always closing as I ha e lost tons of $$$$ in the last 23 years with some wins .

I was an options trader. I usually was drunk 80% of the time from 2000 to 2017 while trading.  This resulted in chronic tilt.

After quitting alcohol,  a new hing took over me. Anxiety.  I did get entry I to many good trades but due ti anxiety , I would exit fast as I felt something worse happen to me if I held the positions. The stress the palpitations the constant reminder the sweating made me anxious and then  exit the positions which would recover very quickly most of the times.

Anyways the anxiety again made go one tilt and quick trading leading to the end.

I no longer sleep with any stock price on my mind. My sleep has improved.  My appetite has improved.  As a result my anxiety has improved too in the last mo th as I was playing with a couple of hundred dollars the last 1 month.

These are not conditions for a ripping equity market. 

On balance, the fed, fiscal stimulus; which admittedly are big. Also, vaccine news (which I think is the type of think to sell the news because this is priced to perfection). 

But on net, I think its important to pick individual names that would benefit in either environment (shutdown or otherwise). I personally like calls on FLGT, BMA, NBIX, EVBG. Puts on BBW, MLHR, MC, UMBF, TCBK.

You better hope Stimulus saves us, because these vaccines definitely won't. Why should you listen to me? I'm either a licensed pharmacist who makes a living analyzing clinical outcomes data or a full-blown autist who has lost thousands making reckless plays (I'm actually both)

So I was looking through Pfizer‚Äôs well-guarded Phase 3 COVID vaccine data and came to the following conclusions:

Pfizer stated they achieved an incredible ‚Äú90% efficacy‚Äù in the trial which has enrolled 43,538 patients, 38,955 of which received both required doses. But what does ‚Äú90% efficacy‚Äù really mean? They are referring to the ‚ÄòRelative Risk Reduction‚Äô which is a number with no external validity. Essentially, RRR, is a way to inflate what the real-world effectiveness of an intervention is by removing the good outcomes of the non-intervention arm of a trial. It is the incidence difference between the placebo and intervention arms, divided by the incidence difference of the intervention arm.

Let‚Äôs say you have a 2% chance of having a brick fall and hit you in the head, but there is an intervention available that reduces your risk of a brick hitting you in the head from 2% to 1%. The RRR = (2% - 1%) / 2% = 50%. When in reality, your absolute risk is reduced by 1% (ARR = 2% - 1% = 1%). 

Now let‚Äôs apply this to the Pfizer data. Pfizer only reported a few numbers: 90% effective, 94 positive cases in both arms, and 38955 patients receiving both doses. Trial arm splits are always very close to 50/50, and knowing those 3 numbers, we can do some math and come to the following data table:

&#x200B;

||Placebo (No Vaccine)| Intervention (Vaccine) |
|:-|:-|:-|
|COVID Cases |85|9|
|Enrolled |19,388|19,567|
|Outcome Incidence  | 0.438416% | 0.045996% |

As a double-check, the RRR = (0.438416% - 0.045996%) / 0.438416% = 89.5% (round up to 90%)

But let‚Äôs dive a little deeper. Based on this trial, there is a 0.44% chance to contract COVID-19 without the vaccine, and a 0.046% chance to contract COVID-19 with the vaccine. Your absolute risk reduction would be 0.39%, which means getting the COVID-19 vaccine reduces your chance of contracting the disease by 0.39% (0.0039). 

So how many vaccines would we have to give to prevent 1 COVID case? This is called a Number Needed to Treat (NNT) and provides the number of interventions (vaccines) required to prevent one outcome (infection). NNT is calculated as 1/ARR, then rounding up to the next highest whole number. The NNT for Pfizer‚Äôs vaccines = 1/0.0039 = 256.4 = 257 patients must receive both vaccines in order to prevent one case. Sounds bad, right? Well, it gets worse. Roughly 7% of each COVID case leads to a hospitalization, and roughly 2% of cases lead to death. This means that to prevent 1 hospitalization, 3,672 patients must receive both vaccines (257 / 0.07), and to prevent 1 death, 12,580 patients must receive both vaccines (257 / 0.02). 

The intervention arm in this trial, at best, prevented 1.6 deaths (19,567 / 12,580). 

To prevent the roughly 240,000 COVID deaths in the US, over 3 billion vaccines would have to be given (240,000 x 12,580). For a point of reference, there are only 325 million people living in the US...

Guess what? Yeah, it still gets worse. The primary outcome of this trial was a COVID-19 infection within SEVEN DAYS OF THE SECOND VACCINE. So technically speaking, any effectiveness of this vaccine is only for 7 days and you could essentially be completely vulnerable again (this likely isn‚Äôt the case, but still is still a possibility). 

Moderna's data ain't much better. Their NNT is roughly 177. 

I didn't even mention the supply chain nightmare Pfizer's vaccine will cause since it needs to be stored at -70^(o)F.

Here is more bad news, there is virtually no long-term safety data available for these vaccines. Long story short, The FDA isn't going to approve this anytime soon.

What makes me qualified to do this? I work in buyside and am semi-literate. Here is my non-investment advice on DraftKings. 

**What‚Äôs new:**  DKNG reported Quarterly adjusted revenues of $133mn (+42% year-over-year  (y/y)), which was at the high-end of the pre-announced $131mn-$133mn range. [(link)](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1772757/000110465920111952/tm2031612-4_s1.htm) DKNG also reported adjusted EBITDA of -$197mn, better than Wall St. Consensus expectation of -$203mn.

Also with the earnings release, management increased revenue guidance  to $540mn to $560mn, and introduced 2021 revenue guidance of  $750mn-$850mn (+45% y/y at the midpoint), the consensus estimate was  $776mn. This range doesn‚Äôt include contributions from Michigan or  Virginia, which could both launch online sports betting late this year  or early next. Management‚Äôs guidance assumes that they continue to  operate in all states where they are currently live and announced sport  calendars aren‚Äôt disrupted. 

**Valuation Methodology:** I continue from my initial  valuation of DKNG last week ‚Äì What‚Äôs clear is that more states will  legalize betting and more Americans will be exposed to sports betting  and online gambling avenues and the market will grow overall. What is  less clear, however, is how fast this market will grow. I approach this  valuation by starting high level, focusing on the growth of online  betting markets, and then following with DKNG‚Äôs market share of the  future betting markets. I believe **DKNG is simply a beneficiary of overall online betting market growth, not some standalone idiosyncratic tech pioneer,** therefore  I believe starting with Total Available Market (TAM) is the best  approach for a valuation here. From Deutsche Bank in their updated Note  on DKNG ‚ÄòLimited Changes to Forecasts‚Äô ‚ÄúWe expect the market to continue  to trade shares around TAM and growth trajectory views, much of which  will be dictated by the pace of legalization and investors garnering a  better understanding of how \[that\] ultimately flows to net revenue and,  down the road, EBITDA.‚Äù We use 2025 EBITDA as anything beyond five years is simply impossible  to predict. Feel free to disagree with me in the comments and tell me  why you disagree.

I try to keep this analysis high level so we can plug and play growth  figures for both the market and DKNG‚Äôs share of that future market  because analyzing line items or on modelling on revenue multiples, is a  pointless exercise for growth companies because appreciating from $500M  to $5B is way more likely than $100B to $1trn. This is a rapidly  changing company in a disruptive industry and it‚Äôs stock price reflects  expectations of the future of American online gambling and DraftKings‚Äô  ability to capture an increasing share of that market growth. 

**How is the Street valuing DKNG?:** Goldman is Neutral  rated with a 12-month price target of $53 based on equal parts 2030  EV/EBITDA (discounted), 21.3X 2024 Sales, and a Discounted Cash Flow  model.

Morgan Stanley is in-line and equal-weighted with a price target of  $37 valuing DKNG on a 18.5x 2025 EBITDA model. 18.5X is a comparable  tech multiple. 

Deutsche Bank models DKNG at a price target of $48 on a multiples of  25x 2027 EBITDA, discounted at 5% for 5 years. They note that every 10%  move in EBITDA from their current forecast is worth \~$4 to their Price  Target and every multiple point is \~$2.

**Our Model:** I start off with management‚Äôs 45% y/y  growth figure for 2021. I credit DKNG with this growth next year, then  crucially, I decrease the growth rate by 5% every year forward, so 40%  growth in 22, 35% in 23, etc. because **DKNG is starting from a smaller revenue base so 45% will be easier to achieve in 21 than it will be from a higher base in 23**.

If the online sports betting and gambling markets grow at these rates  from 2020-2025 (about a 35% annual growth rate), and DKNG is able to  capture a 23% blended total market share of these markets, at a 30%  EBITDA margin and 18.5x EBITDA multiplier (we borrow this from MS), I  get a valuation of around $39, implying \~9% downside. Let‚Äôs look closer:

I start off by estimating the online sports betting and gambling  market size below. I go off the estimated 2020 figure of around $3.14bn ‚Äì  $1.33bn from sports gambling, $1.5bn from iGaming, and $286mm from  Daily Fantasy. Next I grow them by the CAGR‚Äôs in the previous paragraph  and you see the results. For purposes of this valuation I designate this  growth profile as my Base case. I don‚Äôt want you to stay fixated on the  \~35% CAGR but rather to see the effects of the rate on overall market  size come 2025. We can argue all day about the numbers, but trying to  estimate the growth of the market to the decimal for 5 years out is not  an efficient exercise. This is still a nascent market experiencing a lot  of disruption with no clear predecessor case studies.

[we get a TAM of over $14bn in 2025 with our estimates](https://preview.redd.it/t30x9yg71qz51.png?width=2045&format=png&auto=webp&s=e08d7b245f1f6921194ba48f1439bf9235a67418)

Given there are 240 mm adults in the US, to arrive  at even a $20bn TAM, implied that not only does every state legalize and  all 240 mm adults can bet sports on their mobile phones, but that ‚Ä¶ the  adult spend grows by \~65% from this $51 level‚Äù. I look at the idea of full legalization and spend per adult in the table below. 

[my estimates](https://preview.redd.it/wtxr7tl41qz51.png?width=586&format=png&auto=webp&s=b312d244223438e31c41464b06b6a153246d3205)

To get to our $20bn TAM, indeed every US adult would need to be  spending $84 a year on sports betting and online gambling. This ties out  with DB‚Äôs 65% figure.

Next I estimate the DraftKings‚Äô EBITDA based on the market size and  their share of this future market. An important point is DKNG‚Äôs  promotions and how much it subtracts from top-line revenue. We use 20%  here, but management has stated in the past that promotions are  generally in the high 20%‚Äôs. We give DKNG credit for being able to  continue to decrease promotional activity in the future, so for our 2025  EBITDA analysis we settle on 20%. Just for reference, promotions were  \~26% in Q1 and Q2 of this year. 

I use a healthy 30% EBITDA margin across all levels of market share  and market size. As you can see, our Base Case is $785 mm in EBITDA for  2025. Not bad for a company expected to have over negative $400mm in  EBITDA for 2020.

[my estimates](https://preview.redd.it/koro8zd21qz51.png?width=1466&format=png&auto=webp&s=2d9832798a99afa1408ef0046b9fc583e75b2b62)

Finally, given the current stock price of $42.84 at close on 11/13, what  is the implied 2025E EBITDA multiple for all these scenarios? Here‚Äôs a  table summarizing that below: 

[ At the close of 11\/13 DKNG is valued at 20.38x our 2025 estimated EBITDA based on our model assumptions and estimates ](https://preview.redd.it/udn68v801qz51.png?width=1438&format=png&auto=webp&s=38002b750b3c13a96b5e596b2fa52efbe6d48363)

Every additional turn in the EBITDA multiple adds \~$2 to our price  and every additional $100 mm in 2025 EBITDA adds \~$5. If the market  grows by only 15%/ year with lower market share and EBITDA margins in  our Bear Case, we get a valuation of $14. Likewise, if the market grows  at 45%/year with higher market share and EBITDA margins in our Bull  Case, we get a $75 valuation.

I layout some clearer Bear/Base/Bull Case scenarios at the bottom as well in more detail:

https://preview.redd.it/00glviwy0qz51.png?width=888&format=png&auto=webp&s=79caa9668938824c4a72a08756fc7112f9e68b77

**Upside Risks to Valuation:**

1. Stronger than expected performance in 2021, which could accelerate growth in TAM realizations
2. Better-than expected margin performance, especially less promotion activity that eats into top-line revenue
3. DKNG is able to take outsized market share
4. Favorable regulatory events and large states making progress toward sports betting

**Downside Risks to Valuation:**

1. Considerable stock unloaded coming off management lockup agreements from the IPO 
2. TAM expectations becoming more muted, leaving far-out forecasts like the 2025 EBITDA we use being especially vulnerable
3. Promotional activity could last longer than we think and be a drag on revenue
4. Greater impact from competitors, leading to decreased market share and/or further necessitated promotional spend
5. Negative legislative outcomes

&#x200B;

So, I was wrong.  Inclusion happened early which makes sense.

Normal inclusions are 3-10 days.  Never in the history of S&P has an inclusion been announced 35 days prior like Tesla.

But, also never in the history of S&P included a company as large as TSLA.

Stock split caused a really nice rally for a couple weeks which was unfounded on solid grounds.

S&P inclusion will buy up 10% of all available float shares (shares that are "for sale" by retail etc) (not elon and other people who won't sell)

Over 120,000,000 share will need to be bought by the inclusion date, AND NOT SOLD.  They basically turn into non-float shares which takes them out of rotation.

My suggestion: BUY TESLA IN ANY FORM POSSIBLE

shares, calls, LEAPS, whatever.  The only stipulation is to do it ASAP.  This will be a month long bleed up easily pushing us past ATH of 500 a share.

This idea is not based on fundamentals of the company, elon, or anything else.  Simply the statistics of how many shares need to be bought and how many are available to sell.

How many people in the right mind would sell at 420-480 knowing that 120million shares will be bought and held over the next month?

&#x200B;

So a little background about myself.  I am the black sheep autist of the family.  I have 3 brothers, and my father is high political figure in my community.

My older brother Kyle is a doctor.  Married with Kids.

My younger brother George is an manager of a warehouse, he also is married with kids.

Then there's me, Greg, a 33 year old ex drug addict with 3 kids with 3 different moms.  I work for $12/hr at Chuck E Cheese,as the dress up mouse that dances for kids every hour and they make me make pizzas when its not my dancing hour.  And Cheryl is a cunt manager who gets mad at me for smoke breaks.

Anyways, I am driving my 96 year old great grandmother to Walden's Bookstore (that she keeps forgetting that amazon ran out of business 2 years ago) and also just spending some time with her looking for any open blockbusters so she can rent some vhs tapes.

She turns to me in the car and says "GEORGE?!"

"No Grandma, its Greg, Not George"

"Right! That GREG! IS AN UTTER MESS, HE LIVES A SHATTERED LIFE.  I NEVER SEEN SUCH A MESS, SUCH A TWISTED MESS!"

User commentary as replies to the messages below are encouraged. Report bugs to /u/zjz._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ The case for $XOM - Texas tea is back on the menu. $XOM has strong support and only has room to move higher. The headwinds faced by Exxon are pretty obvious, they produce oil and people have been travelling less since COVID began. However, XOM also has its fingers in upstream, downstream, natural gas, and chemicals. I do not trade CL and know next to nothing about O&G, but that is not going to stop me from posting some borderline shit tier DD. I‚Äôll address the fundamentals, namely addressing the top criticisms of XOM that I have been seeing most recently:

**They are no longer in the Dow Jones**: who cares, we aren‚Äôt octogenarians.

**The EV/Green threat**: The people who have been bagging on XOM seem to think oil is their only business and that the popularity of EVs is going to kill the industry.  EVs currently make up less than 2% of vehicles on the road in the US. Exxon knows that the shift toward green energy has started, but it will take decades to lay down an infrastructure to rival our current energy pipeline. After all, this is Exxon, the company that warned ~~nobody~~ itself about global warming fifty years ago. Additionally, even if first world countries are the first to make the leap, the demand for oil in developing economies isn‚Äôt going anywhere anytime soon. Furthermore, a major competitor in BP decided that XOM was a dinosaur and they were going to become a utility instead. Good luck with that BP.

**Political threat**: Right now, the political crosshairs are squarely on fracking. This has hurt long time S-tier companies like Schlumberger who recently sold its entire NA fracking business. However, that threat seems to have been overstated. Biden has made some confusing and contradictory remarks regarding fracking. However, his written plan only calls for the "banning new oil and gas permitting on public lands and waters" -- not ending all new fracking anywhere or those existing on public lands. In short, a nothingburger.

**Political threat, Pt. II - subsidies**: That said, Biden has also hinted that he would end subsidies to oil companies. I assume he was kidding here, as this would lead to the most regressive policy I can imagine. Subsidies in the O&G industries are not the US Treasury writing XOM, BP, etc. big checks every year ‚Äì they are taxation avoidance mechanisms such as percentage depletion, and tax deductions. Drilling for oil is not an exact science. Presumably, the government understands this. When you spend millions drilling a dry hole there should be way to write that cost down. These subsidies ensure that companies in the US continue to provide a strategic resource for the US. They have existed for over 100 years in the tax code because there has long been the recognition that we need to keep the industry alive for a multitude of reasons ‚Äì the paramount of these being energy independence. If Biden were serious about amending the tax code to remove tax preferential status to O&G producers we could face one or both of the following: (1) US surrender of energy independence, and/or (2) crushing increase in pump prices which would adversely affect low income people (presumably Democrats). Not only would elimination of subsidies imperil the country, it would be the least politically expedient move if the Democrats hope to expand their base. Those inroads they made in Texas will not mean a whole lot if the O&G industry burns down and people will be less than impressed when they are seeing $5/gal at the pump. However, some studies suggest that removing these tax benefits would lead to [negligible decline in oil production and negligible reduction in oil consumption with minor increase of cost to the consumer.](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w22537/w22537.pdf) Complicating this issue is that several industries benefit from these sections of the tax code, which would result in other lobbying efforts against their modification. Finally, even if Biden were serious about attacking these subsidies, he would need to have the political support to change the law which he simply will be unable to do regardless of what happens in the Senate: in scenario A ‚Äì the Republicans keep the Senate and nothing happens; in scenario B ‚Äì the Democrats take the Senate, but infighting on energy issues prevents anything from happening. There is a very real schism between progressives and blue dog Democrats as things stand and unless those issues resolve in short order in scenario B, I cannot imagine the subsidies being in real jeopardy.

**Political threat, Pt. III - Harris**: If Harris becomes president oil will look bullish to me as every post-apocalyptic movie I have ever seen has fire barrels everywhere, which are presumably fueled by gas and wood. This is also a bull thesis for $LL to the extent that they sell untreated wood.

**Company bloat**: As one of the big boys, XOM has been justifiably criticized for its employee size especially in a down year. XOM had more than 88,000 employees (\~13k of which were contractors) at the beginning of the year ‚Äì they are laying off nearly 2,000 people in Houston, 1,600 in Europe and have publicly stated that they may lay off as much as 15% of their global workforce. Who is getting let go? In the US, people from the management. They announced the cuts at the same time that they announced the dividend was safe at 9.65%. XOM has stated that they are moving to prioritize the highest value investments, namely: Guyana developments, Bacalhau deepwater, maintaining exploration outside of the US, pacing short-cycle growth in the Permian, optimizing non-US natural gas, and progressing on their chemical plants in Texas and China. They have met their target decreases in capital expenditure by 35% and have forecasted continued production growth for next year. In short, XOM is going lean.

**Debt**: [manageable.](https://ir.exxonmobil.com/node/30951/html)

Those are the problems that people keep posting about on fool and other boomer sites, which in my opinion are  overblown. Now the good:

**Oil consumption**: This is the elephant in the room. Demand died with COVID, but so did production to a lesser extent. Brent prices averaged $40 in October ‚Äì with global consumption of 95.3M b/d, which was down nearly 6M b/d from last October, but up nearly 10 b/d from the Q2 2020 average.

The EIA forecasts that WTI will average $38.24/b through the end of 2020 and $44.24/b in 2021. It currently sits at $41.47. Not enormous figures, but the market is speculative and oil is a cyclical industry. Projections regarding production have been bullish and all indications show demand is picking back up.

**Dividend**: The Q3 call confirmed that the 2020 dividend with a massive 9.65% yield was safe. Furthermore, the call assured investors that the quarterly dividends would be protected in 2021. Of course, this came to the detriment of laid off employees who have expressed their frustration that they lost their jobs so that shareholders could capture $.87/sh. Whether XOM will incur debt to pay their next dividend is not clear - if WTI hits $55/b they would not need to take on any additional debt.

**TA**: I donno, looks good to me man.

**TL;DR**: Fears over XOM and the O&G industry are overblown. We need oil to make cars go. We need oil to make other things like tires for cars. We also need chemicals - XOM makes those too. More people are driving cars and we just neared 90% of where we were this time last year in terms of insured daily vehicle use. Some competitors are exiting leaving more room for XOM. Subsidies are safe. Dividend is safe for next year. Buy equity and collect dividends if you want to stay in your safe space. PT for me is $60 by EOY 2021.

**Position**:

Nobody knows the future goals or ambitions of this company. Hell, they probably know more about your future than you know of them, even though they‚Äôre publicly traded. 


Why buy now, you ask? Because once people figure out why the company will grow the opportunity to buy on the ground floor will be lost.

This is a Southwest Airlines Company that operates in the United States. As you can see Moderna's vaccine will come out, however, other Airline companies like BA with debt ratios of -14.62 will not do well. $LUV, however, has a debt ratio of 2.65, and the price of COVID-19 has already been placed in as the revenue as expected is not doing as well. However, their total assets have positioned themselves into a great place into the Airlines market. They have also raised 18.9$ billion in excess before COVID-19. This is much more than their fuel contract of 20$million

Their Earnings Per Share is currently negative. To solve this they must either reduce the amount of shares or increase earnings. This will them to drive their revenue up. They are in a great position to run the airline industry once a vaccine is out. Although their outlook for November is a negative outlook of -35% of passengers, they recently went offensive finding new planes and passengers by adding cities to their routes. They have no plans to increase their assets by the time COVID is taking place.

Key takes:

Best company for Moderna Vaccine News as they will lead the industry because it will take a very long time for BA to get out of debt.

Technicals:

It tried to break down bearish below the wedge today. Ultimately it failed and remained bullish for intra-day trading, and bullish on the 6-month chart. This stock could be well be worth 150$ by January._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ I have failed you anakin. _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Zoom Split and SP500 First I want to say **fuck you** to the mods who took this down when I labeled it DD, **they're trying to keep you all gay and poor**.

Here's the original post (flair'd correctly I guess) :

Last time I presented WSB with the opportunity to acquire PLTR 01/2022 15 calls (check post history) and was basically called a gay retard by everyone. Thus this gave me the confidence to stick with the position and will now be snorting coke off of hookers in a couple years.

I'm now coming to you with the next galaxy brain idea. About an hour ago news broke that TSLA was going to be included into the SP500 after everyone thought it was no longer going to happen.

I'm here to say that it's a solid bet that Zoom will most likely be announcing some sort of stock split on their earnings on 11/30 which will rip market cap even higher.

This increase in market cap, revenue/profits, and now becoming a staple of education and business will eventually lead it to be adding in the SP500 in December at some point.

I think you could pick up 1/15/2021 600 calls for around 6.50 tomorrow and watch them pull a 5-10x by expiration.
