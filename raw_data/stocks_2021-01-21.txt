[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/l297kz)_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Random Theoretical Stocks Question I've been wondering for a while, what would be the outcome of having the stock market open 24/7. Would the extra time result in more trades and more volatility? 

Would it generally increase the value of stocks in the market or decrease them?

Or would it make no fundamental difference?

At its core this query is asking whether the stock market moves because of actual changes in news regarding companies or is it mostly due to a flurry of trades.

I would love to hear your opinions, thanks._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $50 February Stocks Challenge Me and a much more experienced friend challenged each other to see how much profit each of us can get from trading stocks in the month of February from only $50. We thought it might be a fun little thing to try as I am brand new to the stock market and we both like a good learning experience.

With that being said, does anyone have any suggestions when it comes to strategies/stocks that could help me pull out a win? Like I said before, I'm brand new to the scene so I don't know much of anything.

Any and all answers are greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ How to differentiate between “invest in what you know” versus acting on confidential information Hi folks,
I am brand new to trading stocks. I just created my first account today, loaded up some funds but have yet to pull the trigger on any purchases. As I am researching the basics, I often see the advice of investing in companies you know and believe in. 

The company I work for is an engineering and construction firm that works for companies in food/bev, pharma and other technogies. I am exposed to upcoming projects in each of these sectors, for a (fake) example if Kraft foods is planning on doubling their production of Mac and cheese in the next year. Many times these decisions are pending or are in design for many months prior to some kind of public announcements. In those situations, I assume it is wrong for me to take any action until there is a public announcement.

What I am less clear on is situations where I might use my experience working with various companies as a guide for my belief of future growth. Like if I happen to know from personal experience that their leadership is very strong, or if they disorganized, or just general indications of how well the company is run.

I’m looking for anyone’s thoughts on where to draw this line. I want to ethically leverage my experience and “invest in what I know” and want some input from others who may be in similar positions. 

I hope this post doesn’t get me on some list, trying do educate myself on how to go about this the right way!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ ZOMEDICA 1/21/2021 Does anybody know why Zomedica has been bouncing so strangely between a $1 and $1.01 all day?

I'm looking for a way to document my investments showing my holdings, acquisition price and ultimate gain/loss made on each investment. I'll be able to reflect on overall progress and strategy having everything laid out. 

The broker app I use isn't great for this. Can anyone recommend a decent spreadsheet or online template/ (like on notion) that I can use to track my portfolio?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Question Regarding Pre-Order limits on IPOs. This morning, I purchased DFG before it went public (pre-order) for $14.00/share. 

When it went public this afternoon, it was over $20.00. Since I only placed a limit purchase for $14.00 (it's original price), does this mean my order failed and I don't own the stock?

Confused on how this works._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Market Correction I've been investing for a little over 4 months now and its been uphill since I've started. I always hear others talking about market crash coming soon or at least a market correction. Is there truly a way to predict and know ahead of time before it possibly happens or not?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ If it works it's not stupid. I have in mind a very crude trading strategy that I am thinking of implementing. I am a beginner myself so the strat might appear quite stupid. All I need are your opinions about it.

I'm curious as to why everyone only talks about averaging down long term investments or stocks assets that have depreciated  significantly. Averaging down is also applicable for short time frames or scalping. In the words of JP Morgan when asked about the direction of the market- It will fluctuate. I've never seen 5 or more candle sticks of the same color appearing consecutively, especially in short time frame charts. You'd see something like red,red,green,red,green,green,red...In simple words the market does not move in a straight line. So we can set up a strategy where by we average down after every 0.4% percent down move. We can easily calculate how much we'd need in order to stay solvent until a short retrace appears. We can give ourselves an allowance to open up to a maximum 10 averaging down positions. I don't see anything going wrong in such a small time frame. Averaging down is such a powerful tool. If we bought a stock at 100 and it went to 50, it would need to appreciate by 100% for us to break even. However, if we were to invest an additional 100 then the break even would be lowered to 33% !

bonus point: I don't have to pay for commission per trade, only spread.

My main motivation for seeing potential in this strat is because I realized the main goal of most traders is to time the market and get in at the right moment( get in at 5 and the stocks moves to 6 then 7 then 8)..I'm however bad at doing that so I thought it would be easier to get in at random points, average down a few times,then close all the positions with a tiny profit a little past your break even point, rinse and repeat. The tiny profits add up over time. last but not least , watch your money management very carefully. I calculated exactly how much my margin level would be after a given number of average down positions. I'm not doing it blindly. So I know I'll never be wiped out while doing it._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Invest all cash now or wait for market correction which idk when it will happen

What do you guys think_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $RECAF -An undervalued OTC that is on the cusp on a major catalyst Ok so lets get this out of the way, Recon Africa is a oil company... yes yes I hear you clicking away in disgust as you sit in your tesla, but allow me to tell you why Recon Africa has HUGE upside potential. First the company owns the rights to operate in 8.5 million acres of land in NE Namibia and NW Botswana, on the Kavango Basin. Why this is a big deal? Because the basin, according to chief geochemist on the team Dan Jarvie, is estimated to be home to 120 BILLION barrels. At a conservative estimate (.58x NAV) Haywood Capital Markets places a price target at $7/share. This would represent a 233% increase from the current price of $3.

They started drilling on January 11th and state that they will find out if the basin has deposits in 45 days. That is the catalyst, and yes I know the obvious downside would be that the basin does not have oil which would drive the price to basically zero. But here's a quote from the President and Chief Geoscientist of Earthfield Technology, Bill Cathey, "No where in the world is there a sedimentary basin this deep that does not produce commercial hydrocarbons"

or maybe this quote tickles your fancy

“Given the nature of this basin and the tremendous thickness, this is pretty much a no-brainer… it will be productive and I’m expecting high-quality oil.” -Dan Jarvie

Even if oil isn't your thing, which originally its not mine either, this company imo will be criminally undervalued if they find oil (which a high probability) and I can't just stand by and watch as this potential 10 bagger goes unnoticed.

After doing some reading it appear Novavax (NVAX) has a contract for 2B doses of their vaccine signed pending FDA approval of emergency rollout of their vaccine which has proven to be THE MOST EFFECTIVE vaccine at 100% success rate of stoping COVID-19. And while their stock has gone up some 2000% this year, which may concern people it’s too late, their P/E ratio is only 2.19 last I checked!  This indicates they are still very undervalued as the typical P/E ratio in pharma is above 24

With a responsible trailing stop, this may be a strong risk-reward play because if the government gives emergency approval (and with Biden’s 90-day goal of 100M vaccines in-arm for the U.S., this seems probable), the stock could definitely 🚀

Lot of my holdings that are up +400-500% are still short-term and turn long term in 2021 March and April. I am reluctant to sell now because I don't want to pay short-term capital gains. I rather wait a few more months and pay long-term capital gains.

You think this could cause another dip?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ If I use a fixed stop order, will it completely protect my starting cash amount in the stock market? I'm a big-time noob, so please excuse my ignorance.

**Here's the background:**

I have $65k that I want to make some gains on during the next 6-12 months.

**Here's the plan:**

I drop the cash into VOO shares and, god-willing, the value grows $1k above my initial investment amount to $66,000 (I understand the assumption of initial growth carries risk).

I set a fixed stop order that will trigger a sell if the value drops to only $500 above my initial investment amount ($65,500).

As the investment value continues to grow, I slowly raise the stop order amount.

In theory, that would essentially eliminate the risk of losing any of the cash I put in, right? Therefore, the emotional torment of losing any of my original money would be mitigated.

Thoughts?

If you're wondering, the reason I'm keeping this investment plan short-term is because I plan to invest the $65k in a new construction rental property that will be available sometime this coming summer/fall.

**WHAT DO THEY DO?**

* High Tide is a **retail-focused cannabis corporation** enhanced by the manufacturing and distribution of consumption accessories
* Own **67 branded brick & mortar cannabis stores** across Canada
* Bought out, [Grasscity.com](https://grasscity.com/) & [CBDcity.com](https://cbdcity.com/) (The two largest online marijuana accessory websites)
* **Designs, manufactures and distributes proprietary consumption accessories** and cannabis lifestyle products

**WHAT EDGE DO THEY HAVE?**

**They're Canada's Largest Cannabis Retailer by Revenue with over 67 stores opened in 2 years**

**Q1  to Q3 Revenue growth rate of over 800% with substantial backing from  Aurora & Aphria (two of the largest marijuana investment companies)**

**They've been approved for NASDAQ listing which will allow for new investors, including more institutional investors. (** ALSO NEW ON TRADING 212 AND THE STOCK HAS DOUBLE SINCE THEN **)**

**Acquired  two competing companies (Newleaf Cannabis & Meta Cannabis Co)  adding 53 new stores, close to doubling their amount of brick &  mortar locations**

**Canada's economy is spending $20M more than the previous month EACH MONTH, consecutively for the past 2 years.**

**They own the largest online marijuana accessory retailer in the U.S.**

Let me explain why this is a big deal.....

**MARIJUANA LEGALIZATION IS COMING IN THE U.S.**

Last month the U.S House (Democratic Controlled) **voted to legalize marijuana** through the **MORE ACT**, it **PASSED. ALL DEMOCRATS VOTED YES TO DECRIMINALIZE MARIJUANA** but the bill was dismissed in the SENATE because it was **REPUBLICAN** controlled. **BUT**, with the win of the Georgia senate election the **HOUSE AND SENATE** are both turned **DEMOCRAT CONTROLLED**.

with the legalization of Marijuana it's safe to assume Marijuana accessories sales will skyrocket as well.

**LICENSING DEALS WITH FAMOUS PEOPLE**

* **High Tide inc has licensing deals with**
   * **Snoop Dogg, Cheech & Chong, Trailer Park Boys, Guns N' Roses & Hellboy**. They're about to be the weed version of **cartoon network** with funny ass ads everywhere.

**MANAGEMENT -** They have a superstar team with the two highlights being their CEO/CRO duo

1. **CEO - Raj Grover:**  Since starting his first company at the age of 22, Raj has established  himself as one of Canada’s foremost business strategists and deal makers
2. **CRO -** **Andy Palalas:**  is a business growth and sales professional with extensive experience  in the loyalty marketing sector, a track record of explosive growth in  franchise sales and operations.

TLDR:  They're a retail focused marijuana company with a strong hold on all  marijuana consumption accessories. They've 67 stores and opening another  62 this year after acquiring their 2 largest competitors. Continuing  with their theme of buying out competitor they purchased the #1 & #2  largest marijuana accessory websites in the world [Grasscity.com](https://grasscity.com/) & [CBDcity.com](https://cbdcity.com/).  Their financial reports has grown over 800% in the last 2 quarters and  will continue to explode. Marijuana is becoming legal in the U.S because  of the Democratic house/senate majority.

Today as seemingly always, the imminent question on everyone's mind is price target. Will it hit $40, or $50, or even $100? Will it Dip back to Teens? Will it reach $50 EOD, or EOM? Hundrerds?   Both those of us who have been around for year know last week's ROD is more Important than your Stock Account. It sounds crazy being posted on Stock Board, but believe it not, MONEY is not why LAC (specifically THACKER Pass) is important, to me or to the USA.

Friends, we are on the precipice of an energy Revolution worldwide. Electric Vehicles will reach cost Parity with ICE within 4 years or less. Green Energy generation (Solar, Wind etc) is Exploding. All of which needs to be STORED when not ready for immediate ground, it has not been Developed, and we remain dependent on others for supply such as Oil etc

Enter THACKER PASS, the SECOND LARGEST know LITHIUM DEPOSIT in the world. Thacker Pass is key resource to help mitigate our growing dependence on foreign supply of critical materials like Lithium. I want to be careful to keep politics out of this (ex Biden is huge On Saving Climate) , but there is no REAL denying our national Preogative is, and will always be to pursue energy independence. We do that by developing domestic resources like Thacker Pass.

Thacker PASS: IT TOOK TEN Years to secure GOVT Approval. It is a Big BIG Deal, Culminating on 1/15/2021 with the Bureau of Lang Management's Issurance of a Record of Decision Fully and Finally approving the project. The Approval is Historic, a watershed moment in the path toward USA production of the critical components that we have all come to depend on.

**Math Time:** In thinking about value, we hppen to enjoy simple convenience of a Nice Round Number. 101 million shares Outstanding. A $2 billion Market cap (almost exactly) $20 per share, $3 billion @ $30 per share and so on OR $40 per share to reach 4 bilion market cap. To ask "is it possible $LAC could hit $40??????? ---> is to ask , could market could ever hit $4 billion.

In assesing value more specically, we can also enjoy the simplicity of approaching the company as sum of its part on two primary assets: 49 % interest in the Causchari-Olaroz brine project in Jujuy Province, Argentina ("CO") AND a 100 % Interest in the Thacker Pass project in Nevada USA ("TP")

Construction of CP is over 60 % COMPLETE already, and fully capitalized. Construction will complete Q4 2021, AND Lithium Production will begin Q1 January 2022 (11 months from now) at 2 Million Tons proven and probable reserve of battery grade lithium in Carbonate equivalent ("LCE"). Production capacity of 40,000 tons per annum ("TPA"). Operating cost of $3.579/Ton. A 40 year project Life.

Construction of TP, of course, has not started but underlying resource is well documented. 3.1 Million tons of LCE proven and probable. Production Capacity of 60,000 tpa. Operating Cost of Around $4,000/Ton. A 46 year project life.

Conservatively 80,000 Tpa of LCE X $12Lk/ton (LAC's assumed avg price) = $ 960 Million revenue minus $4k/ton (high end of cost of production) = $640 million EBITDA. But in my opinion, thats too LOW. We are on precipice of unprecedented surge in worldwide demand for LCE. Experts say Demand will in crease 10x IN Ten years, Some are saying 6x demand will increase by 2024 alone. LEC prices have already risen 50 % in 6 months but are still very depressed. If LCE recovers just to 2018 levels ($25k/Ton): 80k Tpax$25k/ton= 2.0 Billion revenue, $1.6 billion EBITDA.

As for what multiple should apply to these figures, your guess is as good as mine. For illustration, ALB boasts $ 3.34 Billion revenue, $853 EBITDA, A $19.18 billion Market Cap, fetching a trailing price/sales of 5.91, SQM has 1.78 billion revenue, $572 m EBITDA, a $14.87 billion Market cap, fetching a P/S 8.37. May be $LAC is lower, or higher, or somewhere in between. i leave it greater minds of Fellows here than my own mind to Project.

But if (1) despite Surging demand LCE Spot prices never rise a penny above $12k/ton and (2) we apply a very low 5x sales ration, fair value of LAC could be $4.8 billion , i.e $48/share. If LCE price recover to 2018 elvels we keep the same low 5x sales ratio fair price for LAC could be 10 billion, i.e $100/share. iF lac Fetches the same multiple as SQM (8.37 x sales) we get $16.74 Billion i.e $167/share. And if Worldwide Demand for battery grade lithium Carbonate Rockets beyond supply as anyone paying attention predicts it will.....That friends, is when "2 DA MOON" starts to sound apt.

So Coming in full circle to the endless predictions of share price: My opinion is that all of you are correct. Yes, the share price will reach $30 $40 $50 and beyond. Yes, there will be voltalitity and Pullbacks along the way, there always have been and always will be. Yes, retracement to low $20 or teens is possible, especially when the broadter market corrects (as it inevitably will). And yes, if your horizon is long enough, t***his stock will reach into hundreds of Dollars per share as the company continue to execute on plans*** that are a Decade long in the making. ($LAC already have success in other plants in other countries, keep that in mind)

The underfying recourse is critical to our future way of life and competitiveness as a Nation. The developments are already approved and on their way to Production. The project life span is 40+ years. LAC is not going Anywhere, It is JUST GETTING Started.

I'm pretty new to all of this. I was curious on current opinions on dividend stocks/ETFs?

That could have been easy gains right there and I’m just wondering if there’s some downside to just perpetually using this strategy and making small gains.

Shift Technologies is a San Francisco-based online automotive dealership that allows consumers to purchase their vehicles completely hassle-free and online. Shift’s online platform concentrates on peer-to-peer transactions and integrates a streamline of services that regulates detailing of the cars, test drives, vehicle purchase documentation, auto-coverage, and more. 

To date, Shift is backed by 26 investors and 4 lead investment firms: Lithium Motors, BMW iVentures, Goldman Sachs, and DN Capital. The total funding capital accrued is $299M, of which $40M was collected in April 2019 in a series D funding. 

Despite falling short of revenue and EPS expectations in the previous quarter, Shift has demonstrated resilience as a smaller, but growing, competitor in the automotive space. In October 2020, Shift IPO’ed in Q3 following a reverse merger with Insurance Acquisition, and s-p-a-c. This was a fair play to mitigate the expense of a traditional IPO filing and a strategic step to increase early exposure in the market and to increase liquidity. As part of the merger agreements, Insurance Acquisition will acquire 6M Class A shares of Shift when the underlying reaches a specific price that is undisclosed. Since its IPO at ~$9.85, the underlying has fluctuated between $14.91 highs and $6.40 lows. As of today, January 20, 2021, the share price sits at $8.45.

Retail investors and stock exchange media outlets scrutinized Shift for its untimely decision to go public in the midst of a pandemic, but CEO George Arison explained that the s-p-a-c route is an inexpensive, more deregulated, and shortcut to tap into the public market. Arison also wanted to take advantage of the increased liquidity potential via the s-p-a-c route as funding opportunities are more accessible than the standard seed company scouting for investors. The $299M funded to date can cover Shift for an extended period of time and to ride out the pandemic shortcomings. As reported in the balance sheet, Shift has net annual liabilities of 44M, and while not yet profitable as it is still in its early stages of breaking into this tough industry against major competitors, it can sustain for at least another 2-3 years assuming expenditures and revenues stabilize at these pandemic levels. 
My opinion is that Shift has grown out of its speculative phase as a seedling private automotive company and into a company that is making notable gains in market share and consumer awareness. One fascinating statistic about Shift is their high EBITDA profit margins: 15%/20% for buying/selling respectively. For comparison, Carvana brings in 7.7%, Vroom 4.9% (depreciation from 2018/2019), and 6-7% for the average online automotive company. This may be associated with the brand reputation that Shift has established over a number of years through effective advertisements on diversified social platforms, through its excellent user experience and user interface, and the accessibility and usability of its mobile application and website. Apart from this, the user demographics on Shift is centralized around the younger generation of car buyers that value convenience, streamlined application services, and its assisted technologies to make the process of car buying simple, easy, and stress-free. I think the greatest thing that sets Shift apart from its competitors is really in its under-appreciated market capitalization and its attractive price-to-sales ratio floating at 4.56. Shift continues to show that it can stay in business despite pandemic conditions and is expected to see increases in revenue, EPS, and margins. This makes sense because in-person dealership transactions have plummeted between 15-45% in most areas, creating a stagnated situation on site with lower demand, all while redirecting traffic towards online sales and third-party insurance companies. All in all, Shift is a great prospective investment with high-yield opportunities. Its $8.45 price tag is especially attractive to small-time retail traders with lower investment capital - of course, this is just a psychological effect of diluted shares.

My price target for Shift in 2021, contingent on the company achieving some or any level of growth, conservatively is $18-19. This valuation is based on a price to sales ratio of 8, which aligns well with some of the smaller cap competitions in this space. Another noteworthy mention is that Shift is still largely undetected by the market, only driving in 1.25M in volume. With a share price below $10, these volumes are significantly lower than stocks within this category/price cohort. 

Short interest as of 12/31/20 sits at 4.78M shares, which is 4x the average daily volume. Should this stock become widely traded and associated with its counterpart competition (i.e Carvana, Vroom, etc) we may see a compelling case of short squeeze. 

On the contrary, I think Shift needs to expand its inventory by partnering with companies that have great synergies, such as an EBay Motors, Autotempest, Cars.com, etc. Partnerships with insurance companies are also viable options as insurance companies are also seeking out opportunities to reach wfh professionals. Even an Uber deal to subsidize some of the cost of owning a pre-owned vehicle strictly for Ubering would be ideal.

Apple will report results next Wednesday, Jan. 27, and Street expectations are growing more bullish by the day, leaving its shares just a few points below their all-time highs.

Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty on Thursday reiterated her Overweight rating on Apple stock and lifted her price target to $152 from $144. She writes that her checks find that Apple saw strength across its products and services portfolio in the quarter, driven by 5G iPhone adoption, the work-and-learn-from-home trend, and sustained engagement with the App Store.

“We are buyers ahead of what we expect to be a record December quarter print,” Huberty writes in a research note. “Our recent conversations suggest investors expect Apple to release solid, but not great, December quarter results. We disagree and believe that Apple is likely to report all-time record quarterly revenue and earnings.”

Huberty expects double-digit revenue growth in all revenue segments, with “risks skewed to the upside” for iPhones, Macs, and Services. Her revenue estimate for the quarter is $108.2 billion, well above consensus at $102.6 billion. She sees profits for the December quarter of $1.50 a share, above the Street at $1.40. (Note that the company didn’t provide any guidance for this quarter, citing the uncertainty associated with the pandemic.)

“We expect demand strength to continue and our fiscal 2021 revenue and EPS estimates are both 5% above consensus,” she writes. “Given positioning into the quarter is muted after the rotation out of high quality stocks over the past several months, we expect strong follow through post-earnings.”

Huberty thinks the iPhone 12 was Apple’s most successful product launch in the past five years. She forecasts 78 million iPhones shipped in the quarter at an average selling price of $825, delivering 14% revenue growth to $63.9 billion—twice the growth rate the Street consensus currently projects for iPhone revenue. And she expects the momentum in iPhones to continue into 2021. She notes that Apple’s Taiwanese supply-chain partners had have three consecutive months of accelerating year-over-year sales growth, which she thinks signals strong iPhone sales in the coming quarters.

D.A. Davidson analyst Tom Forte also repeated his Buy rating on the stock, noting that the stock looks “delicious,” though it has pushed past his $133 price target. (He says his target is “under review” pending next week’s earnings report.) Forte also has estimates above consensus for the quarter—he sees $106.2 billion in sales, with profits of $1.52 a share. “We believe Apple’s first lineup of smartphones on 5G networks are better positioned than investors completely appreciate,” he writes in a research note.

Monness Crespi Hardt analyst Brian White also repeats his Buy rating, while maintaining his $144 target price. White’s estimates call for $105.3 billion in sales and profits of $1.47 a share. “The strength and linearity of this economic recovery remains a wildcard; however, we believe Apple’s strong balance sheet, iconic brand, rapidly growing services business, pipeline of innovations and hardline stance on personal privacy will allow the company to emerge from this crisis stronger,” he writes.

Apple shares are up 3.1%, at $136.10, in recent trading. The stock is up more than 6% in the first two days of the Biden Administration, increasing its market cap over that short period by $133 billion. The stock sits a hair below its all-time closing high of $136.69, reached on Dec. 28, 2020, as well its record intraday peak of $138.79, which it touched on Dec. 29. Apple shares have a market valuation of $2.278 trillion, and Apple remains the world’s most valuable company.

On March 16, 2020.  Blue Appron stock priced moved from 2.30 to 28.00 in ONE DAY.   ***That's an 1100% gain in one day with the stock price.  Options moved over 100000% that day.*** The reason was an infinite short squeeze similar to the one that is happening with GME.

&#x200B;

# Blue Appron Short Interest (SI)

During that period Blue Apron's short interest was 50%.  Blue Apron was running out of cash and shorts piled on.  Then the pandemic happened an people started ordering meal kits en mass, infusing Blue Apron with large inflows of cash.  Fearing, meal kits had become a secular trend like ride sharing, shorts started to cover.  But they soon discovered shares were limited.  So the infinite squeeze happened.  *They had to cover at any price to balance their books when Market makers started to sell off their other positions.*

&#x200B;

# GME Short Interest

Currently GME Short Interest is rumored to be above 100% \[1\].  Thus the environment is similar to the Blue Appron infinite short squeeze.  Namely, there are no shares for GME shorts to cover, once the infinite squeeze occurs and MM forces them to balance their books.

Moreover, the squeeze hasn't happened yet, given that the Short Interest hasn't moved lower.  In fact, it has been rumored short interest has increased as shorts make a last ditch effort to scare off the bulls.  But the markets is aware how the conditions are there for an infinite short squeeze.

&#x200B;

# Behaviour of an Infinite Short Squeeze

The behaviour of an infinite short squeeze (ISS) are violent.  In financial history, the two widely cited cases are the VW infinite squeeze of '08 and the Blue Appron one of '20.  As you can see, infinite short squeezes have been rare because most rational agents would never get themselves into a situation which would lead to an ISS.

When shares can't be covered and stock price increases, shorts are forced to cover by Market Makers.  But because of the huge supply/demand imbalance, shorts have to cover at prices that would seem irrational on a cursory glance but are rational based on the supply/demand equilibrium of available shares.  ***Consequently, it is normal to see 1000% increases in one day.  And 100000% gains in 0dte options.***

As more market player realize the infinite short squeeze is inevitable, the tripping point of the squeeze collapses from months to days to hours.   *The only way shorts can alleviate the narrative of inevitably is to spread fear, uncertainty and doubt (FUD).  So as long as GME stock positions are maintained, and more shares are bought, the short squeeze is inevitable.*

Owning stock or options are better than a lottery ticket because the odds are in your favor.

* A new Mack series will be launched soon, a truck of Class 6-7. This too is only available with this company's gearbox;
* The market for 'First and last mile transport' is growing due to the explosive growth of online retail. This means more commercial vehicles are needed to deliver all parcels;
* Margins are always under pressure in the transport sector. As a result, there is a constant demand for better products. Management responds to this by developing gearboxes that last longer with less maintenance, and that ensure lower fuel consumption.

Frazier, Deerfield and Baker Brothers are three of the premier early stage biotech investors in the world (the fourth being Orbimed).

In the simplest terms, MIRM is working on a treatment for several sever liver diseases. These diseases affect about 10,000 people globally every year (so this is an orphan drug). The existing treatment is a liver transplant with all the expense and risk involved. This means the drug can command a price in excess of $100,000, maybe even twice that.

The company went public in mid 2019 at $15 and has two subsequent equity raises in January 2020 and December 2020 at $20. Those really smart biotech investors i mentioned above have yet to sell a single share. They were all investors prior to the IPO. Frazier was the early stage investor and installed the CEO, Chris Peetz. Chris was the CFO of Tobira which was sold to Allergan in 2016 for $1.7 billion. He then joined Frazier as an Executive in Residence - basically a guy they wanted on their bench for a future company - and co-founded MIRM in 2018 with Frazier's backing.

Why buy now? MIRM's first drug should be approved in the second half of this year. There is very little scientific risk between now and then.

I have been following Frazier companies for several years. Guess who was involved in GRTS? Frazier. I own a bunch of Frazier's creations and have learned to be patient.

I’m also looking into RKT as I feel like it’s undervalued and all I see is upside with the company._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Buying stocks after big drop (simulation) Im new to investing, and as Im sure most all investors have noticed at some point, a trend in many stocks: after a stock experiences a large drop in price, it is often followed by a large increase (rebound) in price. This sparks many keen investors to attempt to "cash in" on this behavior, and see if they can get large 10-20% returns, as seen in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/2u20sy/is_constantly_buying_and_selling_as_stocks/). Luckily for me, I have \*some\* programming experience, so instead of dumping my real life savings into this experiment, I wrote a Python program to simulate it.  


My program takes in a CSV file as input, which I used two separate sheets containing 350 different random stocks each, with historical data over a 5yr period from Jan. 1, 2015 - Jan. 1, 2020 (arbitrarily). The program reads this data in line by line, looking for the the desired drop/increase in price.

The parameters you can easily set yourself, such as how big of a drop youre looking for, how big of an increase to sell at after buying, how many different stocks you want to hold at once, and how much money to invest initially. I also made it so you can set how many of the 350 stocks (or however many stocks you have in your CSV file) you want to monitor, and how many times you want to repeat the simulation. Ex. repeat 1000 times, looking at 30 stocks (30 different stocks picked randomly for each of the 1000 repeats). 

After the simulation is complete, the resulting returns are added up and stats for the simulation are produced as output. Ive split the results into separate brackets for a better idea of the result. Here is two sample outputs of two 350 stock sets over a 5yr period, running 1000 repeats while monitoring 30 stocks/repeat (one is of my better returns, but dont get too excited by the impressive results, the other is not so good):

From my simulations and testing various settings and stock data, Ive found that there **is** a possibility to get huge returns, but the results are not consistently great enough for me to deem it worth continuing this experiment, or involving any of my "real life money". However, I enjoyed playing around with this, learned some things about stocks and programming, and this concept was something that I had been wondering about for a while. 

Ive put most of my files on Google Drive, so anyone can download them and play around with the program (if they have python installed), and do the tests for themselves if theyd like. Hopefully this also helps anyone else save risking their savings, or maybe someone will build on the program to make one with a higher chance of better returns!

I might as well keep my original investment in the stock in the hope that it continues to build and really start making some decent cash.

 Please note the 60 day is just the "earthwork" which I assume means leveling the ground ready for construction.

The second factory of Jianghuai Weilai started bidding and is expected to be put into operation within the year

01-15 08:42 Cenard (Beijing) Information Technology Official Account, Car Master, Quality Creator attention \[Aika Auto Industry Information Original\] Recently, the bidding announcement exposed on the Internet shows that Jianghuai NIO is bidding for its manufacturing base. The new base construction site is located in the section of Jiangnan Road, Economic Development Zone, Hefei City. According to the 60-day planned construction period shown in the tender document, it is expected that the second factory of Jianghuai Weilai will be completed and put into production within this year.

It is worth mentioning that the Jianghuai Weilai manufacturing base has just been selected as the 2020 Anhui Smart Factory. The Jianghuai Weilai manufacturing base, which started in October 2016, was completed in one year and three months, and delivered more than 10,000 units that year. As of November 2020, nearly 80,000 units of ES8 and ES6 models have been delivered. EC6 sales have continued to increase since mass production and delivery started in September. With the launch of ET7, the construction of the second factory also prepares for future sales growth.

1-2) Second to this Great news The current JAC factory is expanding to meet demands and future growth.  Really exciting stuff like a test track and an energy centre and sewage treatment station which sounds like they will make the factory as environmentally conscious as possible.  Basically every stage of production is getting a boost from painting workshop to press and welding.  Project expected to complete in 1 year, total size of upgraded facility is over 270,000m2 of building area.

I'm looking for thoughts from anyone that might have some personal experience using Skillz and/or bear arguments I might not have considered yet. 

Cathie has started building a position in SKLZ recently, adding it to ARKW on Jan 4, 5, and 19th this year at prices of $18, $20, and $26 respectively. Currently it sits in the $28 range with a market cap of $10 billion, top of the mid-cap territory, leaving lots of room for growth. Given the support ARK funds have had in this sub it's a bit surprising SKLZ hasn't gotten much attention.

Skillz operates as an e-sports tournament platform, in a market where videogames have really started to flourish. They've had some regulatory issues due to the potential "gambling" nature of gaming for cash prizes. The gaming industry should continue to grow as the pandemic continues, and my hope is that Skillz capitalizes on this boom. The company isn't profitable yet, which is the case for a lot of growth stocks early on, but they've consistently beat earnings in the past several reports. Last ER was 09/20 with 92% YOY revenue growth.

Netflix crushes earnings while Jack Ma finally appears. General Motors partners with Microsoft to develop their self-driving tech. Let’s talk about this and other stock market news**

**\~Very Long Post\~**

Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let’s start with the recap of the last 2 days, as Tuesday we saw the stock market rally with the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/bR7cJ13) gaining over 1.5%, the broad stock market [SP500](https://ibb.co/fXZYKRS) rising by .81% and the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/yhDLD82) Industrial gaining 116 points to finish the day, as the [VIX](https://ibb.co/kJPWrR3) dropped over 4.5%.

Over 60% of the [companies](https://ibb.co/BT7vfL0) were advancing with over 200 new highs on above average volume as 8 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/M7wNJ2Q) finished in the green with Energy, Communications & Technology leading the way while Real Estate was the biggest laggard, as growth companies were [outperforming](https://ibb.co/zbgJRWC) with small-caps gaining more than 1%, while Large-Cap Value was the biggest underperformer.

[HERE](https://ibb.co/Dbb47Jn) is the HEAT MAP from Tuesday, as you can see most big tech companies were gaining with Google, Facebook & Alibaba posting a gain of more than 3% while the biggest laggard was the consumer defensive sector.

Yesterday we also saw the broad stock market finish with all 3 major indexes at all time highs as the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/s3D1kvZ) lead the way, up almost 2%, while the [SP500](https://ibb.co/9hV9fhV) gained 1.36% and the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/5B3r1D5) rose 257 points as we saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/P9mtRCH) dropping more than 7% after the removal of this big political event.

We didn’t see that many companies advancing [yesterday](https://ibb.co/zZzFY6b), with only 57% of them gaining on average volume though 10 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/cTszSd6) finished in the green with Communications leading the way after a huge spike in Netflix, while the Financial sector was the only one to lose ground as Large-Cap Growth companies [outperformed](https://ibb.co/8mVHFyx) the rest of the market, with Large-Cap value play finishing the day down almost 1%.

Here is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/LvGDryV) from yesterday with all big tech names gaining over 2%, as Amazon, Google & Netflix all gained more than 4% while the biggest laggards were seen in the banking & biotech sectors.

We didn’t get to much economic data in the past days, with the most interesting one being the Redbook store [sales](https://ibb.co/zPDB0pj) which improved slightly over last week, as the economic calendar was on pause, awaiting the inauguration of the new US president.

[Today](https://ibb.co/jgJ1frz) we start getting more economic data, as we start off with Jobless Claims early in the morning and close with the Money supply and the FED’s balance sheet. We have to see if last week was just a blip or if the jobless claims will continue to rise even more.

In some other stock market news, we saw [Netflix](https://ibb.co/54tB18g) miss the earnings/share but beating both the revenue, and especially the net adds of subscribers, which came in at 8.5M vs the 6M expected as the biggest streaming platform has passed 200M subscribers. Netflix spiked [yesterday](https://ibb.co/B6zTrSp) more than 16% and closed at an all-time high as they have hinted at a sustainable free cash flow after 2021, as the company will no longer seek to raise debt and is expecting to start stock buybacks in the next years, which will be a great positive for shareholders. Another benefit is their pricing [power](https://ibb.co/s93DdWz) , as they have just increased their most popular subscription plan by 1$ and they can do this even further with minimum risk of losing to much of the subscriber base. I really like 3 companies in this sector (Netflix, Disney & Roku) and I think you should own all 3 of them as this is the future, while the old TV and cinema world is dying.

We also saw [GM](https://ibb.co/hyb3GSB) rising after entering a new strategic relationship with Microsoft. This looks like a nice partnership between the two, with GM using Microsoft’s cloud computing to develop their Cruise venture, which is a subsidiary of GM. And on the other hand, this deal will provide needed capital to Cruise to fast-track their self-driving tech while also making Microsoft, GM’s preferred public cloud partner. I think GM is a very good play on the EV world with massive production capacity and good battery technology.

[Tuesday](https://ibb.co/Q9JYY6D), we saw Jack Ma finally show up after numerous speculations of his disappearance. This is finally some good news for Alibaba and the shares are up over 6% since the spotting, after those speculations led to a continued sell-off in the stock as investors feared China’s Government implications around the company. Alibaba is still a great company that will remain one of the biggest e-commerce companies in this new world, and that is still fairly undervalued right now.

Sports betting soared again after the latest reports of new [records](https://ibb.co/KF1Wy78) in Pennsylvania with over $500M in wagers in December, and is also expected to go live in Michigan on [Friday](https://ibb.co/9spwZMT). Morgan Stanley also [expects](https://ibb.co/3CSLKFT) more states to push to the legalization of sport betting even faster than expected. I personally like companies like DKNG, PENN & WYNN in this sector and I am not planning on selling in the near-future any of them.

We also saw investment banks crushing earnings in the past days with [Goldman](https://ibb.co/6rzBBNh) crushing earnings by almost $5 and an increase of 18% y/y in revenues while Morgan Stanley also [BEAT](https://ibb.co/Lp3dJbp) expectations with an EPS beat of 64 cents and an increase in revenues bigger by over $2B than expected. I think the financial sector is pretty fairly valued right now after the huge run it has seen in the past [months](https://ibb.co/k0wTBVn) and it might only see another boost if rates go up, but that will inversely affect the rest of the stock market, so overall they might be a nice hedge against a potential rise in rates in the next years.

And one final thought is that I think staying invested in the markets is the best way to go as always. Even if the market experiences a short-term pullback or correction, I believe this will be short lived. It doesn’t matter if we see tax increases or not, it doesn’t even matter who is president… You should stay invested and look for the best opportunities in the markets.

[HERE](https://ibb.co/1QxtfSH) is the average SP500 return since 1933 under each president, and both averages are way above 5% for each party, far exceeding inflation expectation for the future, so stay invested, look for the best companies and hold even through tough times and even look to add on any weakness in the markets. Keep in mind that the [SP500](https://ibb.co/DKym45m) return for the first 100days of a new president is usually very good, with the last 3 terms returning at least 5%. We can also see the [DOW](https://ibb.co/VDG7vyC) has returned over 10% on an annualized basis for each of the past 3 terms, which is way over the historical average.

Biden has had the biggest [rally](https://ibb.co/wYZKGmT) between the election date and the inauguration date in the past 70 years, so, don’t expect huge gains like we have had since March, but do stay invested even if the markets start to see a slowdown… Your money is better off being invested rather than siting in a regular bank account where they will do nothing.

So, let’s hope for a good day in the markets as the [WORLD](https://ibb.co/9Z075Fy) markets seem to be pointing to another good day, after Biden’s inauguration and Janet Yellen’s latest remarks on the economy and the need of big spending, while the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/rf6B1Z0) are also pointing to a green open, with the DOW leading the way.

Fairfax owns [8.3% of BB outright](https://whalewisdom.com/filer/fairfax-financial-holdings-ltd-can#tabholdings_tab_link) worth approximately $600 million and in September [bought debentures convertible to 55 million more shares of BB @ $6 per share](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/09/02/2087633/0/en/Fairfax-Announces-Acquisition-of-1-75-Convertible-Debentures-of-BlackBerry-Limited-After-Redemption-of-Existing-Convertible-Debentures.html). Fully converted, this is $1.3 billion of exposure to Blackberry for a holding company with a market cap of < $10 billion.

FRFHF trades at 84% of its last quarterly reported book value on 30 Sep 2020 (prior to much of these gains) of $442.17. The BB gain alone represents a book value gain of about $23 per share, ignoring other portfolio holdings that have been performing well (e.g., their top 13-F holding ATCO is up 20% in the quarter). FRFHF is now effectively trading somewhere between 75-80% of book value with exposure to some great underlying businesses, which includes insurance operations around the globe._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ What do you do when the stock you want to buy is just going up and up in value I'm very new to this. I dabbled a little before but now is the first time I have enough spare cash to actually do something significant.

Right now I am looking at a stock, I know the most basic rule of stocks is "buy low, sell high" and the one I am looking at has been rising very quickly for the last few months.

I am not going to tell you what the company is since I don't want this to be a specifics conversation. I want to know about the general patterns and cycles of stock from your experience.

I have been telling my self that I should wait for it to dip and then catch it before it rebounds, but it literally just keeps rising and has gone up an extra 15% since I last checked it in December.

I believe that in the long term this company will do well and will probably become more valuable, but I don't know by how much, it has to plateau at some point I guess.

I am too new to this to recognise patterns. Should I wait for it to dip or buy now at high in the hopes it goes higher?

The price is the highest for this company that it has ever been and it has been climbing at 10%-15% month on month. It plunged in March (like everything else) but it is now almost double what it was in Jan last year.

I am a little scared that it is currently in a bubble and it will plunge soon before levelling out at a more normal price. Is that what I should expect?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ How many stocks should I invest in with 3k? Hey guys,

I am new to investing, and I would like to know if 9 different stocks is too diverse to start out with. I currently am looking to invest $3,000 to start out with and then DCA every two weeks/month after that.

So far my plan is:

Apple (30%)
ARKK (15%)
ARKG (15%)
AMD (10%)
Disney (10%)
NIO (5%)
Invitae (5%)
PLUG (5%)
Skillz (5%)

Is this too diverse, and should I start investing in a fewer number of stocks? 

I am currently trying to put 80% into stronger stocks, and about 20% in riskier ones. However, would this portfolio still be considered risky considering the percentages I am putting in different stocks?

Thanks, and have a nice day!

January 20th saw the inauguration of Joe Biden as the 46th president of the US. The build-up to this day has broken recent stock market records. Since election day on 3 November and the eve of the inauguration on Tuesday, the S&P 500 grew 12.8% — the largest increase for the period between election and inauguration of a US president in 92 years, *MarketWatch* reports. 

Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs analysts have suggested that investors should consider market dips as chances to buy equities, as it thinks a bear market unlikely.

 Is a bear market unlikely after Biden's inauguration?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ A simple crossover theory. So to set the scene, for a living I’m a designer, and I like to dabble in stocks and have seen some nice profits recently. I have recently noticed a very simple crossover when it comes to brand and stock prices increasing. Recently we spotted GM Motors stock price soaring due to their Microsoft partnership. We’ve also today seen the same with Kia as they’ve been tasked to rollout the Apple car (rumours). Now something both of these brands have in common is that they recently rebranded, business that go into partnership with the likes of these blue chip brands have to rebrand just before announcing something like this to remove their old stigma and show they’re ‘moving with the times’. Hence why GM Motors and Kia both did this just before announcing the news. So just a theory, if you’d like to spot potential news before it’s announced, keep your eye on rebrand websites such as https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/ it’s worked for me in the past couple of months. Thoughts?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ One Up on Wall Street question For those of you who read One Up, Lynch constantly talks about earnings.

Does he mention his definition for earnings anywhere in the book?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ How confident were you when you started investing using the knowledge you learnt? I’d like to think that I am an intermediate to the stock market, I’ve read 3-4 books on investing and strategies. I have also actively invested in the short term for the past year with decent growth in capital. I’m up ( 125%ish) starting with $125.  

That’s all good and fair but the more I read,  it seems the more indicators and signs a company needs for good growth. Does it not feel overwhelming to remember and apply it when doing analysis of a company? For example, books I’ve read word it as if  there must be great EPS growth, the stock should be in accumulation phase, should be near its 52 week highs etc etc. 

Meanwhile there are companies like TSLA, skyrocketing without even having a P/E ratio? I understand that TSLA is in a bubble at the moment but before then, TSLA was still showing fast momentum growth with negative EPS. 

The issue lies within, with all this analysis that needs to be done, how does one even find the new market leader? Am I just over complicating things and looking at too much? Should I just look for 3 signs for a good company, enter the trade with a stop loss and see? Maybe it’s FOMO but if i feel like I could have made a lot more money if I didn’t worry about analysing a company and instead just entered the market. 

Does anyone else have a similar feeling??

Let’s talk about DAR, founded in 1882 and the most undervalued Green/Clean Tech on the market.

What do they do?

Darling (gotta love the name) recycles foodstuffs, grease, garbage and leftovers to produce everything from oils to gelatin to biofuel.

Background 

Solid financials, this is pretty much a boomer safe stock for downside but has Bidenboosted greentech upside. Solid earnings, growth and balance sheet. Lots of insider holdings as well. 

They are a global market leader in their respective markets with up to 26% market share in for example the gelatine business.

Recently they have destroyed their earnings estimates delivering a profit of US$0.61 per share, an impressive 39% above what was forecasted. Yet they are still valued at a reasonable forward P/E of 22 which is nowhere near the ESG multipliers we are used to.


Looking ahead

There are three factors at play here which make it so attractive.

1) ESG valuation. Once the market picks up even more on DAR the multipliers will simply increase. 

2) Intrinsic Value and Growth. DAR is growing by itself, generating new business from new areas.

3) Green Wave and subsidies. Off road vehicles are not going electric anytime soon and fuel cells are far off. Fossil fuels are not going away, but here is Darling, ready to provide renewable fossil fuel in the transition period. This might be the only legally available diesel in 10 years, and they’re way ahead of competition. 

The biofuel segment is expected to grow 20-30% per year and they are finding new ways of finding sustainable alternatives to for example collagen manufacturing, recently launching a MSC-certified marine collagens.

For the most part (to me anyway) it doesn't change my outlook of a company at all. If I thought they would succeed before at whatever they're doing, I still would think that: they just have more funds for projects/business. 

Obviously it is situational too, if the funds are more going to the companies' survival than towards projects and expansion (Air Canada?), I wouldn't be as positive in my mindset

The 2 studies I will be comparing are **A Prospective Multicenter Evaluation of the Accuracy of a Novel Implanted Continuous Glucose Sensor: PRECISE II (Sen’s CGM -** [**https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29381090/**](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29381090/)**)**

**&**

**Accuracy of a Factory-Calibrated, Real-Time Continuous Glucose Monitoring System During 10 Days of Use in Youth and Adults with Diabetes (Dex’s CGM -** [**https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29901421/**](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29901421/)**)**

According to these studies, the 90-day survival rate of Sen’s CGM (the FDA approved shelf life before replacement) is 91%, compared to Dex’s 10-day survival rate of 87%. Not only does this give Sen’s product a 9x greater shelf life, but it also gives Sen’s product a 4% greater survival rate at the end of their respective shelf lives. This is pretty significant when patients depend on these products with their lives, and I have yet to see this information come to many people’s attention.

Furthermore, the studies evaluate the MARD (mean absolute relative difference) between both CGMs and reference blood glucose levels (a lower % means the reading is more accurate when compared to a reference statistic). Sen’s CGM observed an 8.8% MARD between its measurements while Dex’s CGM observed a 9.9% & 10.1% MARD. This means that not only does Sen’s CGM have a longer shelf life and higher survival rate at the end of that shelf life, but it also has greater efficacy and accuracy throughout its usage when compared to the industry standard.

This all comes at a time when Senseonics is proving its merit as a mainstream alternative to Dex’s CGM. Senseonics has already achieved FDA approval for their system ([https://www.healio.com/news/endocrinology/20190607/fda-approves-nonadjunctive-indication-for-eversense-cgm](https://www.healio.com/news/endocrinology/20190607/fda-approves-nonadjunctive-indication-for-eversense-cgm)), they’ve simultaneously wiped their debt and sold 40 million shares to institutional buyers (which won’t dilute stock price since this was through a registered direct offering - [https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210117005052/en/Senseonics-Holdings-Announces-50.0-Million-Registered-Direct-Offering-of-Common-Stock](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210117005052/en/Senseonics-Holdings-Announces-50.0-Million-Registered-Direct-Offering-of-Common-Stock)), they’ve recently been granted more backing by major insurance agencies ([https://www.bizjournals.com/washington/news/2021/01/20/senseonics-adds-insurer-initiates-50m-offering.html](https://www.bizjournals.com/washington/news/2021/01/20/senseonics-adds-insurer-initiates-50m-offering.html)), and they’re already on track to provide a CGM with a 180-day shelf life (2x the current shelf life, 18x Dex’s current CGM’s shelf life) with half the calibration frequency required. ([https://www.senseonics.com/investor-relations/news-releases/2020/10-05-2020-123008373](https://www.senseonics.com/investor-relations/news-releases/2020/10-05-2020-123008373)). Even after the recent surge in stock price, Sen’s is only trading at 1/60th of Dex’s market cap (650 million to 35 billion) and still has a massive amount of room to grow. Also, for those not convinced on the big player backing note: over 75% of outstanding shares are owned by insiders (>55% per SEC form 3,4, & 5 [https://fintel.io/n/us/sens](https://fintel.io/n/us/sens)) and institutions (>20% - [https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/sens/institutional-holdings](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/sens/institutional-holdings)). Furthermore, these institutions have slowly been increasing their positions throughout stock dips ([https://fintel.io/so/us/sens](https://fintel.io/so/us/sens))

In my opinion, the prospects for this company continue to increase over time, and I think it has major potential to grow not only because of the disruptive and innovative technology the company provides but also because it's a very easy company for shareholders to understand and gain interest in given how prevalent and widespread Type I & Type II diabetes are (Over 10% of the US population [https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/pdfs/data/statistics/national-diabetes-statistics-report.pdf](https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/pdfs/data/statistics/national-diabetes-statistics-report.pdf) & growing in prevalence by over 10% per decade [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5278808/#:\~:text=The%20prevalence%20of%20diabetes%20](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5278808/#:~:text=The%20prevalence%20of%20diabetes%20)(type,to%20more%20than%20%24622%20billion)

Obviously they didn't crash as hard as stocks but what is the point of bonds if I just gain back my value in stocks quicker. Only reason I see for bonds to exist is if you need to panic sell in a bear market.

So i was day trading with obalon stock and i totally didnt pay attention to the time and didnt sell all the stock before the day ended.

Thank you_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Oil play that could 40x or more. Before we get started, mods, I do apologize for the cap of the stock but this opportunity could really change some lives so I figured I'd try. 

The stock in question is R.E.C.A.F. without the periods obviously. This company (Recon Africa) is a junior oil and gas company engaged in the exploration and development of pil and gas jn Northeast Nambia and Northwest Botswana. So basically they look for damn oil and get the mineral rights for it. 


ReconAfrica holds a 90% interest in a petroleum exploration licence in northeast Namibia. The exploration license covers the entire Kavango sedimentary basin an area of approximately 25,341.33 sq km (6.3 million acres), and based on commercial success, it entitles ReconAfrica to obtain a 25 year production licence. The Kavango Basin offers a thick Permian sequence that we believe will supply a huge conventional oil play.

Also, ReconAfrica holds a 100% interest in a petroleum licence, northwest Botswana which comprises an area of approximately 8,990 sq km (2.2 million acres) and is contiguous to the Namibian licence. The two licences together comprise 34,325 sq km (8.5 million acres).

Its basically unheard of for anyone, ESPECIALLY a junior to get exclusive rights to any land, let alone such a large area. 

Using the metrics provided and assuming they're somewhere close to correct, 8.5m acres leased on the Permian in Texas goes for 24k/acre/year but has been upwards of 70k/acre/year in the very close past (2013-2015). 

So if we multiply 8.5m × 24k we get 204 billion. This property could be worth $204 billion dollars a year. Technically. While that is using standard and potentially wrong numbers. We can use even 10% of that and see this stock run 50x.

This is the very dumb down version for the simple people.

But this stock sits at a 300m cap right now and is potentially sitting on tens of billions. They are currently drilling their test wells to confirm their findings/data. Once this is confirmed the stock could become an unbelievable moonshot with at least a 45-50b cap from its current of 300m.

This is a 100% spec play so dont yolo it unless you're a true degen and live on wsb. 

Do your own research please. This is the very simple version for everyone._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Hypothetical Question: Let’s say I have $100 million dollars at my disposal.  I transfer this money into my brokerage account (which would require an in-person meeting), and I want to invest all $100 million.

Let’s say that I want to buy PLUG stock. This is currently sitting at $62.50 / share. With every penny, I buy every share I can. I would then own 1.6 million shares of PLUG.

Inevitably, this would increase the price of the stock immediately. 1.6 million shares would definitely make a dent in the total shares, meaning the price would rise.

Couldn’t I just sell these shares almost instantly, make profit, and rinse and repeat?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Any harm in placing open Stop-On-Quote sale orders for the same price that you paid? Honest question for a relative newcomer. I’m looking for input as to why the below is a good/bad idea, feel free to tell me that I’m an idiot -

I only invest in pretty safe stocks, bonds, or ETFs. I am in it for the long haul and I’m pretty risk averse with my portfolio. Despite my pretty bland portfolio, I am still afraid of a market crash someday. I am fine with normal fluctuation, but of course I want to protect against a crash. 

An idea came to me, and I’m sure I’m not the first to think of it, to issue open stop-on-quote sale orders for all of my positions with the sale price equal to what I originally paid for each position. This way, if the order ever triggers, I have no gains to pay tax on. I would lose all of my earnings, but I basically break even and don’t lose everything. 

If there isn’t a true crash, but the prices drop below what I originally paid and I’m still interested, I can then buy the same positions again at a lower cost. 

This seems way too simple of a way to mitigate risk, but I can’t find much online about it. Is there anything I’m missing and would you recommend this? Why or why not?

After the recent [huge spike in $BB](https://www.google.ca/search?q=$bb&tbm=fin#scso=_JdMIYOP4E8nN0PEPr4Wh2Ag7:0), I'm looking at the facts:

* Huge [PR spin](https://www.google.ca/search?q=blackberry) to bolster the news into a much bigger deal than the numbers convey (click on "News" to see all the stories about "Is this going to be the next big thing")

This is reminding me of those other "wonderful" companies from 2020 that did the same things. Yes, they seem to have a huge breakthrough just about to happen. Yes, they actually have an announcement or two. Yes, people have gotten excited and rushed in. But in nearly each case, the talk fizzled out and investors were left holding bags (hmm, yet to see what happens long term with NIO, but the rest still holds).

Now I'm wondering if $BB is following in these footsteps. The price jumps seem so OTT in comparison to what they've actually announced. Nearly 100% in a week, 52 week highs, highs not seen for 2.5 years?!

What people may have missed is that by rejoining the WHO, the US will also be joining the COVAX initiative ([https://www.who.int/initiatives/act-accelerator/covax](https://www.who.int/initiatives/act-accelerator/covax)), which right now is 100% focused on getting Covid vaccinations out around the world.
