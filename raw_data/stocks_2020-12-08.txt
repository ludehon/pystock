The share sale plan comes after the stock shot up 12.8% over the past three days to Monday’s record close of $641.76, which boosted Tesla’s market capitalization to $608.3 billion.

The stock [**TSLA,** **+1.27%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/TSLA?mod=MW_story_quote) had dropped as much as 3.6% to an intraday low of $618.50, before reversing course to edge 0.6% higher to $645.60 in afternoon trading. That pushed the market cap up to $612.0 billion, enough to make Tesla the sixth-most valuable U.S. company.

The stock has now soared 95.5% over the past three months and 671.6% year to date, while the S&P 500 index [**SPX,** **+0.28%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/SPX?mod=MW_story_quote) has gained 14.6% this year.

Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said he believes the capital raise is a “clear positive” for Tesla, and further solidifies his “bull case” stock price target of $1,000 and his “base” target of $560, which is 13.3% below current levels.

“We believe this is the smart move at the right time for Musk & Co. after the parabolic rally in shares with the appetite strong among investors to play the transformational EV trend through pure play Tesla over the coming years,” wrote Ives wrote in a note to clients.

Ives is referring to Founder and Chief Executive Elon Musk. He has rated Tesla neutral since April 2019.

Telsa said before Tuesday open that it entered into an equity distribution agreement with a number of Wall Street banks, including Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, Barclays, BNP, BofA Securities, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Morgan Stanley, SG Americas and Wells Fargo.

Shares will be sold from “time to time” through an “at-the-market” (ATM) offering program.

The offering follows another [$5 billion offering completed three months ago](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/tesla-stock-tumbles-toward-2nd-bear-market-in-6-months-2020-09-08), when a large shareholder also sold off some of its stake, and before [the stock is added to the S&P 500](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/s-ps-decision-on-tesla-slated-for-after-the-close-11606765050) index on Dec. 21.

Based on Monday’s stock closing price of $641.76, the offering plan could represent about 7.79 million shares, or about 0.8% of the shares outstanding.

Airbnb is getting blasted in certain cities where affordable housing/limited supply is a problem.  Vancouver for example it is becoming extremely challenging to meet all the criteria, which permits short-term only if:

* It's in your principal residence, in other words, where you live most of the year and the residential address you use for bills, identification, taxes, and insurance.
* It's a legal dwelling unit (a home with an address that complies with all applicable regulations, including building code and fire safety).
* You have a short-term rental business licence.
* If you're renting, your landlord allows you to sublet your home as a short-term rental.
* If you're in a strata, your strata by-laws support short-term rentals in your building.

Essentially, investment properties for short-term rental are out.  Your strata could shut you down at any time.  Essentially basement suites are pretty much the only thing you can f\*cking use as short-term rental now while you're living upstairs, or you want people renting the area you typically live in.

&#x200B;_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Moderna is going up fast, but folks seem to be overlooking Lonza Group I'm fairly new to stock trading and I noticed today that while COVID vaccine-maker Moderna ($MRNA) has been skyrocketing the last couple of weeks, the company they have partnered with to manufacture their vaccine ($LZAGY) has stayed fairly flat. 

I think it makes sense that Moderna would be a favorite in this field. My understanding is that their vaccine can be stored at normal fridge temperatures and are good for a month, while Pfizer's has to be at -70 °C and is good for two weeks. Even though Pfizer has a lot of big contracts, I could see Moderna's vaccine becoming the standard for this reason alone. Moreover, Moderna is a much newer company than Pfizer, so it seems likely to me that Moderna will be leaner and thirstier to make a mark in the world. Still, I've read a few analyses that seem to suggest Moderna is priced well above their likely future valuation.

But something caught my eye -- Moderna has contracted with Lonza Group to make their vaccine, and Lonza has built two plants and hired hundreds of employees to handle the load. Also interestingly, they seem to be a major supplier of the amebocyte-based assays -- a critically important piece of the supply chain that is used to detect bacterial endotoxins in vaccines. This is a product that is derived from horseshoe crab blood, though, which is an unappealing source for multiple reasons, as horseshoe crab populations are on the decline. But what I find most interesting is that Lonza Group has developed a synthetic version of the assay in the last couple of years. 

Maybe all this is already "priced in" to Lonza Group's current stock price. Or maybe people are overlooking it.

Thank you!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ IPO study phase 2: more evidence I started a thread yesterday arguing that buying IPOs around the day they start trading is a mistake because almost all of the IPOs I've looked at hit prices lower than their opening trade price at some point over the next year of trading.  I decided to expand the sample by adding some IPOs from 2014-2016.  I also realized my previous prices weren't accurate because I was using the closing prices on the weekly chart, which misses the intra-week lows.  So I went back over my previous data set and fixed the error.  I also wanted to see if I could find an accurate rule about when the best time is to buy an IPO by looking at 1-month, 3-month, 6-month, and 12-month purchase dates.

**Results**

Total sample: 38 IPOs

30/38 (78.9%) hit a price *below* their opening trade price within the next 12 months

13/38 (34%) were lower at 1 month post-IPO

12/38 (31.5%) were lower at 3 months post-IPO

13/38 (34%) were lower at 6 months post-IPO

16/38 (42%) were lower at 12 months post-IPO

*When did the stock hit its* ***lowest*** *low?*

<1 month: 3/38 (7.9%)

1-3 months: 3/38 (7.9%)

3-6 months: 9/38 (23.7%)

6-12 months: 14/38 (36.8%)

**Analysis**

Although the results aren't quite as one-sided with the larger sample, the results still clearly show that a very high percentage of stocks hit a price lower than their opening IPO trade price at some point in the 12 months following their IPO (almost 80% of the sample).  While there isn't a clear rule for when the best time is to buy, the results seem to suggest that waiting at least 6 months is a smart idea.  More than 1/3 of stocks hit their *lowest* post-IPO low in the 6-12 month period, and 42% were lower than their opening trade price at the 12-month mark.

There is one caveat here, which is that some of the time periods correspond with major market selloffs.  For example, some of the stocks that IPO'd in 2015 hit lows in early 2016 when the markets sold off.  But the reality is that major selloffs are always a risk in the markets so stocks that are popular IPOs now face a risk of a broader market selloff sometime in the next year just as some of the stocks in the sample._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Thursday Pfizer Authorization for Vaccine

As most of you probably know, Apple recently switched from using Intel CPU's to Apple's proprietary M1 chip. But what does this actually mean for Apple as a company?

According to Forbes ( https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2020/11/11/why-apples-switch-from-intel-will-be-highly-lucrative/ ) Apple could save up to $110 per Laptop/Desktop. This is a significant amount of money per unit added back into Apple's bottom line.

And Apple says that Mac Laptops/Desktops make up roughly 9% of their net revenue ( https://www.apple.com/newsroom/pdfs/FY20_Q4_Consolidated_Financial_Statements.pdf )

So I'm no mathematician. But I do know that Apple's new line of computers is retailing for a very similar price to last generations Intel based lineup. In addition to money saving, these new Mac's also become more energy efficient, storage efficient, and performance efficient. And Intel based PC's (to my knowledge) can't compete with all 3 of these benefits at the same price point or form factor. 

So what does this Joe Shmoe think? I think this holiday season a lot of people are going to be getting new computer's and I think for the price and performance a good portion of those gifts will be Mac's. I think that this computer generation is going to make a statement. And I cannot wait for Apple's Q1 earnings report next year. Apple is expanding its profit margin and computer market share. Things look bright short and long term.

* Macs will take 50% of the laptop/desktop market within 6 years
* Apple Silicon changes everything for Apple
* Soon, if you want the fastest computer you have to buy a Mac
* If you want a laptop that has the best battery life, you have to buy a Mac
* Apple will release a Macbook SE priced at $700-$750. They couldn't before because cheap Intel chips were too slow.
* Many iPhone users (50% market share in U.S.), iPad users (65%), and Apple Watch (55%) users bought cheap Costco laptops. Apple can win these customers back with an affordable Macbook.
* AAA gaming will come to Macs. Even the slowest Apple Silicon GPU is as fast as a 1050Ti. Soon, the median GPU in a Mac will be faster than the median gaming PC. Combined with a projected 50% market share, AAA game developers can't ignore Macs. Apple will take a cut of every AAA game sale because they will have to go through the App Store just like how they have to go through Steam on Windows.
* By increasing their laptop/desktop share, Apple will sell more Apple One+ subscriptions because they're adding one more major device to the customer's ecosystem.

Apple is no longer a brand just for the wealthy. Apple is destroying the low mid-end market with SE products that are simply better than the competition. A $400 iPhone SE is faster than any Android phone. It's quite likely that a $700 Macbook SE will be faster than any Windows laptop. Apple is gunning for marketshare. And then they want to sell subscriptions to their customers.

**Final bold prediction: Apple will enter the cloud hardware business and enterprise markets within 10 years.** Bloomberg reports that Apple is making a 36 core SoC. Soon, Apple will realize that they can make a better server chip than AMD/Intel. Apple knows that most computing will be done in the cloud in the future.

Hey everyone ! So, let’s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw the [DOW JONES](https://ibb.co/zn9tpLg) down by half a percent, the [SP500](https://ibb.co/p4M2n7J) down 0,2% while the tech heavy [NASDAQ COMPOSITE](https://ibb.co/wKwCKwg) outperformed, finishing up 0,45 and closing yet again at a new record high. We did see the volatility [index](https://ibb.co/MNPsRvH) going higher, as more uncertainty puts some pressure on the markets with the stimulus and government funding bill on the [table](https://ibb.co/wzM6bt0).

We saw a bigger [ratio](https://ibb.co/TWQQdcx) of companies losing ground yesterday as small caps and especially growth companies outperformed the value plays [yesterday](https://ibb.co/DVpQVkH) with gains being made only in Technology, Utilities and Communications [sectors](https://ibb.co/BrbBWSV) while Energy was the biggest loser as the illness still keeps the pressure on the Oil business.

Here is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/fDSSmKp) from yesterday as 3 of the big FAANG names outperformed the market yesterday, with Apple being up more than 1% while FB and NFLX did even better up 2 and 3,5% for the day. You can also see a lot of red in this map as not many companies did good yesterday except big tech names.

So, some TESLA [news](https://ibb.co/QpNsY6H), yesterday the company spiked to a new all time high at over 640$ as the stock soared over 7% again. The stock has gone up more than 200$ in the last [month](https://ibb.co/xJp0QmJ) as more and more people are buying shares in anticipation of the SP500 inclusion and more and more analysts raise price target and expectations for the company. Tesla also just [announced](https://ibb.co/CJLCnW9) a sell of shares worth of $5B again as the company continues to raise more capital to fund the new factories and firm up the balance sheet while reducing the debt of the company. I think this a good time to be careful and maybe take some profits in this stock before next week, as many people may end up selling shares on the 18th and 21st and we might see a correction instead of a spike in price when the company is included in the SP500. aka \[buy the news/sell the event\] [NEWS](https://ibb.co/1ZLmb8w)

Some of the economic data that we received yesterday was worse than expected as the home purchase sentiment [index](https://ibb.co/fYW7jYD) rising streak ended this month with a dip of 1.7 points and is down more than 11 points year over year.

While the TD Ameritrade Investor Movement is [index](https://ibb.co/N1mkxK7) down from the previous month as investors bought more Apple, Tesla and AT&T shares while selling Moderna, Beyond Meat and Micron.

Also, the small business optimism [index](https://ibb.co/FVg3827) dipped more than expected and fell to 101,2, down from 104 in October.

So, a recent survey from Investopedia [shows](https://ibb.co/hFcyKCM) that over 20% of investors are expecting gains of at least 10% for next year with more than ¾ expecting that 2021 will be another positive year for the stock market.

Most investors [expect](https://ibb.co/1sRKWyt) the biggest gains to be made in the US equities while CHINA and other emerging markets are the next to follow with the Eurozone expected to lag.

While this individual investors [expect](https://ibb.co/dj9LbN9) the large cap tech companies to continue to have big gains followed by pharma and health companies. I think this is a recency bias, as I don’t think any one sector will largely outperform next year, with lots of gains to be made everywhere once the full reopening of the economy will begin. [Jim Cramer Quote](https://ibb.co/pL2v0bm)

I think investors are pretty bullish as the AAII [survey](https://ibb.co/wBhx0Fb) showed last week, I think this might be a problem for the stock market. I don’t think the stock market will go up as fast as investors would like, and this might push more of them into more and more risk taking, especially the new investors, which desire to make a fortune fast. I expect the stock market to be higher by this time next year, but the rate of which it will go up is still going to scare some investors off. As the market sentiment is way into euphoria [levels](https://ibb.co/rvzbx3R) as you can see in this survey, and with retail investors being more powerful than ever before as they account for about 20% of the stock market activity on average daily as we also might see some turbulence in the next couple of months until things will become more stable with the economy, vaccines, politics and everything else with the smart money [index](https://ibb.co/P6VJTQ0) continues to drop while stocks reach new highs, this might be the time to take a wait and see approach and maybe try to buy the dips when they come.

Some good [news](https://ibb.co/Q6WXNtp) came early today the first ever recipient of the public vaccine from Pfizer has been vaccinated today in the UK, this is the start of the rollout of the vaccine in the UK and it is expected that the US will follow in the next couple of weeks. As the “vaccine summit” will be in full [display](https://ibb.co/t3zYjJ6) this week. This is great news for the entire world.

On some individual stock news, the darling of the moment Lemonade just [launched](https://ibb.co/F8FLjgF) in its 3rd EU country, in France, following the Netherlands and Germany launches.

While the 2 big [IPOs](https://ibb.co/23ZKRbh) will come on Thursday as both AirBNB and DoorDash are expected to go public at insanely high valuations.

After the close today we will get [Chewy](https://ibb.co/mbPdtQx) earnings results and I expect the company to dazzle and to crush them, as pets have become more and more popular this year.

Cheers!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Tesla stock drops after $5 billion stock offering plan Shares of Tesla Inc. dropped Tuesday after the electric vehicle market leader filed for the sale of up to $5 billion worth of stock.

The share sale plan comes after the stock shot up 12.8% over the past three days to Monday’s record close of $641.76. That rally boosted Tesla’s market capitalization to $6.08 billion, enough to make it the sixth most valuable U.S. company.

The stock TSLA, +7.13% slid 1.8% ahead of Tuesday’s open. The stock has soared 94.4% over the past three months through Monday, and 667.1% year to date, while the S&P 500 index SPX, -0.19% has gained 14.3% this year.

Telsa said it entered into an equity distribution agreement with a number of Wall Street banks, including Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, Barclays, BNP, BofA Securities, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Morgan Stanley, SG Americas and Wells Fargo.

Shares will be sold from “time to time” through an “at-the-market” (ATM) offering program.

The offering follows another $5 billion offering completed three months ago, when a large shareholder also sold off some of its stake, and before the stock is added to the S&P 500 index on Dec. 21.

Based on Monday’s stock closing price of $641.76, the offering plan could represent about 7.79 million shares, or about 0.8% of the shares outstanding.

How is a stock that doesn't pay a dividend at least once a year not a scam?  When you buy a stock are you not a part owner in that company? If that company makes money one would think the owners benefit. If there is no dividend it seems like you bought shares strictly in the hope someone else will pay a higher price in the future but with no benefit in-between.  

I guess you could argue the profits are reinvested but I would argue that bonuses should be too.  Investor capital gives the leadership the ability to grow the company and earn their bonus so why not us? 

If no company paid dividends what would be the purpose of the stock market? 

Thanks for reading and hopefully some great insight.

Edit 1: Thanks for the feedback. I'm getting a lot on the reinvestment part which is great but its still banking on the hope someone else will buy it. A lot of people say Amazon as an example but what if I said Enron? Amazing stock at the time than went under in a short time.

The hub will use artificial intelligence and machine learning to predict consumer demand for BMW vehicles so the carmaker can order the right parts from suppliers, comply with regulations across different markets and automatically check requirements needed to design new vehicles.

Does anybody older than 50 know of any times where something was solved quickly? Or any market moving events lasted decades in the 70's/80's/90's? And now with tons of input and fake news online.....

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.

The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **"priced in"**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

1. Siebel has a very successful track record of Oracle and Siebel Systems. Both of them have been leader of relational database systems and CRM, respectively.
2. The initial idea of C3 started of as a tool to track corporates carbon footprint, which made quite a few conglomorates interested initially. But with no government carbon tax, there was no incentive for anyone to get this tool.
3. During that time, Siebel has a terrible foot injury, and when he eventually recovers, he sees shit flying around C3.
4. He pivots the enterprise in the IoT sector, since he knows that utility companies are still interested in his ideas and he is known to look in the right direction at the time of crisis. He gets that reputation from the industry elites.
5. Pivoting to IoT, gets him further access to funds which he uses to deploy more IoT devices to create smart grids. These devices are able to work together and predict failures andpain points successfullly.
6. With this success, he announces the name change to [c3.ai](https://c3.ai) and goes on to get government/military contracts.

With all that said, talking about the product which [C3.AI](https://C3.AI) offers:

1. Its not a single product. It is similar to App store of ML apps. They are providing an ecosystem to leverage machine learning in a number of different sectors.
2. They have customers limited to one per sector, because those customers are actually PoC for this model. And it shows that it is working.

Thank you_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ My Dad wants to Invest and I want to help him pick good stocks, ETFs, and help him as much as possible. Hi r/stocks, my dad is interested in Investing in the Stock Market. Tomorrow he wants to open up a brokerage app for chase/another app, and I want to help him out by building a portfolio. I'm on my fresh path to learning about the stock market and know a few good things so I want to help him with whatever knowledge I currently have, even though it's limited. He currently has no experience with this.  He previously had a CD which payed him like 1% and the stock market definitely tops that, so he was exited when I told him of this opportunity.  Here is the rundown: 

1) He wants to Invest $25,000. I'll try my best to build him a strong portfolio with my limited knowledge. I want him to see gains and be happy! So I'll try my best.   
2) I know that going into individual stocks is a little risky, especially at all time highs right now. But it's not smart to time the market either, so I want to get him ETF's, Index's like SPY 500. (stocks too but I don't have enough knowledge with picking good ones yet)

3) Diversification is Key. I won't go all into ETF's, or all into Stocks or Index's. I'll diversify by putting a specific % towards each. 

4) Doller cost avg and buying every week instead of buying at one time. I learned about this very recently, and it's supposed to minimize risk.   


Any advice or additions would be really appreciated. I'm at day 1 of actually building him a portfolio and don't know the ins and outs of different index's, etf's, etc. or which ones are best. I do have VERY basic knowledge though since I've been learning a little everyday!

The way I’ve heard it put is that, investing in all-in-one ETFs is like investing in the past, in what’s worked, whereas investing in disruptive innovation is predicting what the future will be, and working back from there.

My change was from about 15% combined portfolio weight when I bought in 4 months ago and today I am sitting at about 50% of my portfolio invested in these 2 stocks.

They are both level with there little peak from about 6 months ago but well off the match highs.

The way I predict the beginning of the Biden presidency going is a significantly heavier “lockdown” then we have seen, for a set period of time. Of course there’s a million different factors and opinions that can go with that prediction but boil down to just the broad sentence for this. 
 
I think a heavier lockdown can only be positive for these industries (more so for the airlines, but the cruise industry I think will follow and could boom). Like I said before I think once Biden takes office in January we are gonna figuratively zip this thing up for the winter. So thinking forward to, let’s say, April, it either worked or it didn’t. 

Scenario 1: it worked, we nipped it in the bud and heading into the spring we are seeing very low numbers and the vaccine has panned out successfully and is maybe at the phase where all essential workers and at risk populations have access to a vaccine (not really up to date on the vaccine status) 

My prediction: These two industries are pretty much guaranteed to rise back to if not exceed the March highs. If the case load is low and vaccine is on track heading into summer these industries will rise back to March high levels. Heading into fall and winter if we are still seeing very positive signs pandemic wise I can see these industries booming over the winter months. 

Scenario 2: it kinda worked. The lockdown didn’t really do all that much more then what we have been doing. The vaccine has a lot more impact on this scenario. If it’s cruising ahead of schedule that would be great, if it’s lagging behind not so much. For my prediction let’s say the vaccine is kinda working.

My prediction: these industries still rise from the current levels. Not quite to the March highs but maybe recover 60-85% of the current gap. The way I see it is: we locked down for 3 months and it’s didn’t really make the impact we thought. So bows the time to test out if lighter restrictions make it worse. Therefore we “unzip the jacket” for the summer which will lead to the rise toward the March highs. If the summer goes well the stocks will continue to rise, if it doesn’t they will drop but still remain above current price.

Scenario 3: it doesn’t work and the vaccines a bust. This scenario is probably bad for 99% of the market and everyone of us. However, if this scenario occurs, Which I would say is the least likely of the 3, I don’t think it will be as bad for these industries as it will be for most. The cruise industry could potentially drop well off of where it is right now, but that’s a risk I’m taking. I think the airlines are pretty much bottomed out or at least we saw the bottom a month and a half ago. 

Anyways I’ve rambled for long enough. What are your thoughts on these industries I’ve the next year?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Coming Back to Electric Truck Player Hyliion (HYLN) - and DD Months ago, I treated Hyliion's former ticker as a big money-making swing trade on its "IPO pop."  I'm fortunate to have been in the same blockbuster event as [one Blake Denton](https://old.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/jwu6sh/making_money_in_best_reverse_mergers_and_cramer/).

Now, I come back to HYLN, not with the aim of making money in the best reverse mergers, but with a small investment for the long term.

Without further adieu, DD follows.

**About Hyliion**

The company description below comes from a recent Business Wire article.  I can't provide the link as a certain other company can't be mentioned in the link itself:

> Hyliion’s mission is to be the leading provider of electrified powertrain solutions for the commercial vehicle industry. Hyliion’s goal is to reduce the carbon intensity and GHG emissions of the transportation sector by providing electrified powertrain solutions for Class 8 commercial vehicles at the lowest total cost of ownership (TCO). Hyliion’s solutions utilize its proprietary battery systems, control software and data analytics combined with fully integrated electric motors and power electronics, to produce electrified powertrain systems that either augment—in the case of Hyliion’s Hybrid systems—or fully replace—in the case of the fully electric Hypertruck ERX system—traditional diesel or natural gas fueled powertrains and improve their performance. By reducing both GHG emissions and TCO, Hyliion’s environmentally conscious solutions support its customers’ pursuit of their sustainability and financial objectives.

**Investor Presentation**

As someone else wrote here, [Hyliion (HYLN) is not the next Nikola.  This is a good thing.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/j03etb/hyliion_hyln_is_not_the_next_nikola_this_is_a/)

The company's Investor Presentation can be found on their website's Investors page.

As can be shown in the presentation:

1) HYLN has its defined niche: Class 8 trucks.  Not even Tesla will be competing in this field, for a decade or more.

2) HYLN has a total addressable market of $800 billion in the US alone.  One customer, Agility, operates in 100 countries.

3) HYLN won't play the capital-intensive game of setting up EV-related infrastructure.  They are not in the business of being a "gas station."

4) HYLN will first use renewable natural gas and natural gas generators for its Hypertruck electrified powertrain systems, yet is already developing them to be compatible with fully electric solutions such as hydrogen fuel cells.  They are being practical here in addressing the needs of original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) of trucks (for the trucking industry).

5) HYLN already has operational prototypes.

6) HYLN already has million-mileage logs for the first number of trucks already deployed.

**Renewable Natural Gas**

[An article on FreightWaves](https://www.freightwaves.com/news/nikola-hyliion-defend-divergent-paths-to-zero-emission-trucking) provides a brief summary of what renewable natural gas is:

> Renewable natural gas (RNG) starts as a biogas from the decomposition of organic matter, such as wastewater, food, green waste and farming. It is cleaned and processed into biomethane that is injected into the pipeline. When used as a transportation fuel, RNG has a negative carbon intensity, said Deanna Haines, director of Energy & Environmental Policy at SoCalGas.

RNG production is expected to double in the near future.

Infrastructure-wise, there are plenty of natural gas stations in Europe.  For example, Italy has over 1,400, while Germany has over 800.

**Battery Management Supply Chain**

Two years ago, Hyliion [acquired Gentherm's battery division](https://www.freightwaves.com/news/equipment/hyliion-acquires-battery-producer) to have its battery management supply chain in-house.

**Financials**

Future-oriented revenue data (projections), per the Investor Presentation, are as follows:

2020: $1 million

2021: $8 million

2022: $344 million

2023: $1.0 billion

2024: $2.1 billion

Not every target company in a reverse merger discloses current or historical financial information.  In this case, however, [such information can be found in an SEC filing](https://sec.report/Document/0001213900-20-022028/?__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=c38d42b8c68dad4fd4c816b5799dca4bdbe435aa-1601600373-0-Ae7hxOZAy6LXjWjw6G7Ra_bQuy3Ig2re0xzZ8HVp3NVtRg9gOZ5UW-0RpnGg7RMobRYDNgh92m3CLI6_6k-MCw37XKHDzhqXsb7mFT7iOpdy6MWA5MmZDeLPzdmwjftk-8c17hucybdmgOAOT2jSXkLq8EKx3JW11mzOSq1OdzbNrRlsDNo4PBbPshX1D7_0H_3jIyGFkesJQTFSKlqU5VgiVIsKYwGqGh0xUOpq9apt1EOGGQh4UPw7ZpYFYlJduNqSM48x8ZtJn3L4CTdkTRbBINYlTg0c4elHQXkcxtIQpP1bCLZ1aMTRwKqmtTNDSMhiMj0Tv0EMfU5lBYL_xHNul5htXHIinMHI7D2xxBGW8VfbbFp1gRuuUJoeZylFnw#ta_006).

**Values and Governance**

Hyliion has just committed to its reverse merger while having a non-classified board.  It's one thing to assert that the company isn't conducive to fraud like Nikola has been (such as plastic model vehicles with no operating prototypes, or fake orders).  It's quite another to demonstrate this.

One of the problems Nikola has is having a classified board.  In the long run, a classified board isn't as effective as a non-classified board.  This comparison extends to fraud prevention.

**Stock Price Disadvantages**

Being an engineer by background, Thomas Healy does not have the marketing skills of Trevor Milton.

While Hyliion itself has the potential to break away from the Nikola drama, HYLN's price will likely remain quite dependent upon TSLA's price movements, just like all the other stocks in the EV space.  Any out-of-control tweet by Elon Musk, let alone any performance hiccup over at Tesla, could have adverse effects on HYLN.

**Stock Price Advantages**

Even I expected a second wave of COVID-19 to have a correction effect on tech stocks.  I was mistaken in this regard, as large institutional funds have rotated back into the tech sector, including that part of it which is future-tech oriented (TSLA, SHOP, FSLY, ZM, etc.).

**Evaluation**

HYLN is a solid hold for at least five years, maybe even ten.  It is definitely worth a starter position first thing in the morning, and an additional position or two later in the day, for DCA purposes.

As companies and people make zillions on stocks during winter, beware February. Right now, everybody should be swimming in tech, S&P500, and most other companies cash with their 10-100% gains. 

Be aware of the changing of the guard. New people taking over mean new rules and regulations for businesses to follow. The economy will grow, sure, but there is a very realistic chance of a dramatic rotation out of outperforming companies and into diversified ETFs. 

I urge you to research your investments to find which etfs include your stocks and where to put your money when the tide runs out. Speculators will speculate while they can.

There are four dramatic changes/events in February:
Political (obv.), Medical (new doctors notes deregulation), Covid-Vaccine Distribution (likely accelerated), and the anniversary of the Covid Crash. These may make institutional investors nervous, or not. Either way, I expect a large inflow into ETFs, making the market more synchronized.

TL;DR: Investors with less than a year of experience, be aware of the risks that come with new rules and regulations.

All the best, 
WSB_Goof._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Pre market moves? I was taking a look at $GHIV today and noticed that in pre-market (at 5:50am) the stock went up to $13.55 And then promptly went back down to around $10.50 where it’s been the past couple of days. 

What causes a price to do this at such random hours with relatively low volume? 

Can’t people just buy the shares during regular trading hours at a much cheaper price?

1 1/15/21 $12.5c_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $TSLA when does the bubble pop I’m amazed by this. I was in the red for weeks and then it took off. I sold at +25% already just a couple weeks later, and fully expected the bubble to pop after that. But it seems to still be roaring so I’m in it for another run. If I hit another +20-25%, even better.

I plan on being in this stock long term as well but I also see volatility here. It’s running because of hype, it’s bound to pop eventually. But where are the current price targets for everyone? I think that’s the most important part about knowing when to pull back.

Thoughts?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ $ENG ENGlobal Corp - DD 

1. Company is turning around, growing revenues the past few years after declining revenues for 5+. They have started to shift towards renewable and Hydrogen. The company designs and engineers modular systems (think electrical power for the facility) and do all the pipe work for hydrogen plant. Their systems are all designed and built in house in their 80,000 sq for facility and shipped on site, making them lean, efficient and competitive. Also do clean diesel and other renewables among many other engineering projects. Business strategy has shifted from going after more, smaller contracts to less, larger contracts a few years ago and we see this paying off on the P&L.

 
 
2. On track for about $70M in revenues this year with only ~45M Market Cap currently (~25% increase from last year, during COVID, which the CEO has stated has impacted their business). On track for ~40% gross profit improvement this year. All while cutting SG&A costs by 17% (less, larger projects = decrease in workforce). Undervalued compared to other Hydrogen and green energy plays that are grossly over valued.

.


 
3. On track to turn profitable this year.

.


 
4. CEO William Coskey owns over 8M shares or about 33% of outstanding shares and hasn’t sold a single share in over 10 years.

.


 
5. We’ve seen more than 6x volume on several days in this past month than they’ve had in entire months in the past. I imagine we see a lot of tutes taking big positions over Q4.

.


 
6. No debt (only PPP loan which will be forgiven and small revolving credit line which CFO took out to weather any COVID impacts and is just sitting as cash on BS - see SoCF).
 

 .


7. Experience engineering and fabricating first Hydrogen plant of its kind in the US, expected completion was November 2020 for engineering and design phase, with full completion in May 2021.

.


 
8. Actively bidding on potential ~$321M of new contracts. I would imagine more news on these and new hydrogen projects imminent. CEO stated going after contracts in the range of $10M to $250M earlier this year so all it would take is one $100M+ contract announcement for this to jump. (Looks like their hydrogen plant is taking about a year and a half from contract signing to completion, when we think about timeline for revenue recognition).

.


 
9. The client they are engineering the Hydrogen Plant for is Haldor Topsoe. Initial scope of work was $20M and Haldor Topsoe has been happy with the work and increased an additional 15% scope of work. Englobal and Haldor Topsoe have a working relationship and management has stated they are working on proposals between $25M and $125M for other projects with Haldor Topsoe and if Haldor has increased scope of original project and happy with work I imagine we may see some new contracts soon.

.


 
10. 2 different revenue streams which are both growing , Engineering Procurement and Management and Automation. No major single customer concentration risk.

.


 
11. New position created recently , President , with new hire Roger Westerlind. Position created to help drive continued growth and Roger has over 40 years experience growing global engineering and consulting businesses.
 

.


We should be hearing news this week or next week on the progress of the plant and the 24 modules as stated in a PR in August.

.


 
My advise to you is start a small position and keep adding as the dips happen, with such a low float this can run in the blink of an eye.
