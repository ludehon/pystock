 Where is CRSR heading? Will it recover? _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ The world is buying PLTR Just so you're wondering, no, it's not just another shit post saying "haha PLTR go brrr." üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

So if you guys don't know, the US stock market is actually a global casino. Yep, it's not just for US autists, it's also available for retards from all over the world. Also, foreigners do not have to pay any taxes from US stock gains (well if you managed to secure any).

Now, I'm currently working in Taiwan, and today literally EVERYONE is talking about fucking PLTR at work and on the internet, EVERYONE! And people are actually pouring money into this retarded stock.

So no, it's not just 1.6 million autists going ham about this meme stock, it's literally the entire world fueling this Pluto-bound spaceship.

"This has to be the top," you said? **You failed the diamond hand test you fucking retard.** I'm not worried about a huge dump yet because the [institutional ownership of PLTR is only at 12.27%](https://fintel.io/so/us/pltr)!

It's literally "that currency" and TSLA all over again, faith and greed are fueling this to Pluto with minimal dip. I will start worrying about a big pullback once those boomer fund managements are taking over this stock by 40-50%.

Yall b re _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ PLTR and TSLA is all you need _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ An Explanation of Tesla's Recent Surge [Barron has an excellent article on why Tesla has been surging of recent](https://archive.is/bI3Ka#selection-1409.9-1409.68).

The rise in $TSLA since the S&P 500 inclusion announcement is disconnected from Tesla's fundamentals and $TSLA has been behaving more like an independent commodity. Essentially speaking, it's an issue of demand and supply.

The S&P 500 index funds have to buy Tesla regardless of its price when it gets added to the index. Around $4.6 trillion is directly indexed to the S&P 500. This has created a phenomenon of rising demand for $TSLA.  The supply has so far remained fixed. Whatever price you buy $TSLA for now, you can sell it to the index funds (even if the price is higher) from December 18. But wait, it doesn't stop there.

The higher $TSLA rises, the more of Tesla's float index funds would have to buy. The more of Tesla's float index funds would have to buy, the higher $TSLA would get bid up. This has created a positive feedback loop driving Tesla's share prices higher. *The higher $TSLA rises, the higher $TSLA will rise*. There is no obvious place this stops as the index funds **have to buy** $TSLA. Something that might break the positive feedback loop is if Tesla issued new shares. An increase in supply with the same level of demand would drive the price down.

In the 7 trading days since the S&P 500 inclusion announcement, $TSLA has risen on all but one of them and has appreciated 40%. When the S&P 500 announced Tesla's inclusion, index funds needed to buy only $51 billion, now Barron estimates they need to buy around $70 billion worth of $TSLA and 2 million extra shares.

The good news (or bad news for some $TSLA speculators) is that reason would return to $TSLA's price post December 21. The speculators would sell off the $TSLA they bought to the index funds, and the crazy feedback loop would end. However, that wouldn't necessarily be all. Indexers only need to buy a fixed amount of $TSLA. If the speculators overbought $TSLA (bought more $TSLA than the index funds need), they would find that they are unable to sell all their $TSLA to the index funds. They would be left holding the bag so to speak. These speculators may then try to get rid of the $TSLA they have by setting even lower bid prices, and this should drive the price down. **The extent to which speculators overbought $TSLA relative to the demand from indexers and benchmarkers would determine the drop in $TSLA post December 21.**

If you want to short $TSLA, I think short term puts bought on December 21 would be sensible. $TSLA should drop after December 21. It's not clear how far the drop would be, but there would likely be some drop. Before then, for a brief moment in time, Tesla would be the US' sixth or fifth most valuable company and Musk might be the world's richest man._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ The SSSS guy must be really pissed _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ PLTR trendies source - if you guys are wondering where the money is coming from ü•¶üçåüå∂ü•öüçîüå≠ü´ê. 500 bought at 16 sold at 20 for 1.20 premium.

It seems like the rush to get TSLA before S&P inclusion is real.

Questions:

Since a rush could happen much closer to the inclusion date, is there still time for a dip prior to \~12/21? Could it fall and hover at 520 for a week then moon again?

Or is it probable that Tesla just keeps going up (with a dip occasionally) until inclusion?

Or has it just finally been valued as more than a car company and the price won't shift much though inclusion?

Why Is The Market Up When The Economy Is So Bad? | Are Investors Too Focused on the Short Term?

[https://youtu.be/5gBKYnAvECQ](https://youtu.be/5gBKYnAvECQ)_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Normally, I would think PLTR would drop on Friday... here‚Äôs why it won‚Äôt. The institutional money isn‚Äôt going to leave PLTR on Friday.  The professional traders and money managers are going to be home, volume is going to be really really light throughout the whole day across the markets.  The majority have the work day off.

So what does this mean for our üöÄ?  Well, first of all, don‚Äôt expect a huge move in the pre-market in either direction; I expect PLTR to open +- 3% on Friday morning (leaning towards the positive side from excitement of another potential 15-20% day).  

Once that bell rings at 9:30 though, the actual volume is going to be coming from all of our phones; the market is ours for a literal day.  And it‚Äôs at what I consider to be a critical value for PLTR, $30.  With the hype still going strong as fuck for the stock, and with a literal WSB national field day in the markets, I‚Äôm expecting a fat rally, most of it happening the minutes after 9:30 hits.  

Crushing through that $30 level that we saw resistance at today will be crucial for opening up the potential for $40 within the next couple of weeks.

TLDR:  Friday‚Äôs market is our market, I expect a huge PLTR rally which will either open up possibilities for $40, or contrarily set up for a correction on Monday once institutional money is moving around again.

I have made a killing in PLTR but there's another stock that's not talked about at all with many surprising factors. 

MP Materials just gone public via SPAC with Fortress Value Acquisition Corp.   Let's just start with what REE is.   REE is rare earth elements,  I won't go into the details but basically think of permanent magnets.   They are used in  fighter jets,  MRI,  Cellphones etc.    Most importantly what we autist love to hear is they are in EVs and wind turbines which is the hottest sectors right now other than weed.  

I won't go into too much details because you autist with add get lost after the first paragraphs at best.  But as of now the whole market is completely dominated by China and that's why Trump signed an executive order to bring REE supply chain back to domestic at all cost.   This will continue regardless of Biden or Trump because it is crucial for the development of the important industries as well as defense.  China has threatened to cut US off from these precious metals and has done so with Japan for disputes in 2010. 

As of now everything, I mean 100%, is sent back to China and it is refined and turned into alloys and oxides then sent back.   If America want to make EV and turbines domestically the demand is huge.   This is a EV long term play so get in early. 


Why MP?  There are so many REE companies out there? 

- MONOPOLY domestic play. Actually have a functional mine from bankruptcy before.  Now it is under new management and is actually functional unlike other companies.   If you know anything about mining you would know to get a mine functional would take 5 to 10 years not even counting infrastructure.    The REE price is so low to compete we won't be seeing any real competition soon because it is not cost effective to develop a mine. Most REE companies are just a dream where they suddenly wake up and get grants from DOD and everything just magically happens into a 10 bagger overnight.  Only other real non Chinese competitor is Lynas but they are not ally Aussie owned. 

- MP is one of the world's biggest mine in the world

- 1 of 3 companies to receive grants from Pentagon.  9. 6 million for seperation capabilities enhancement

- Phase 2 of 170million to upgrade to produce oxides and magnets

- Investors include Chamath, omega advisors & Slate path capital

- Third quarter revenue grew 52%; net income yoy increased 4x to 14. 6 million ,  adjusted EBITDA grew 159% yoy to 11. 6 million

- LOTS of factors such as EV, defense, China, and solar play all incorporated into one!!  Does it get batter than this?

I can buy 50 puts and have enough cash left over to hopefully build up my account responsibly if this goes tits up. So, the recent run up of Nikola price can be attributed to hope around the GM deal being possible still, but I think people have to come to terms that its not happening. On November 9th on the Nikola website was still linked to the gm deal, but on Nov 11 it was changed and removed any sign of it and the badger. This can lead to a one likely outcome, the deal is done for, with Nikola not wanting to pursue the badger and instead focus on its core business or that GM wants too much from Nikola. With a deal not done by Dec 3rd either company can walk away. I think the probability of this is quite high. On top of this the lockup period for early investors will unlock and there are no assurances from Trevor Milton wont sell his shares, sure a couple of insider have extended there lockup period , but with the possibility come dec 1st that a large amount of insiders will have the ability to possibly dump over 100million shares thats scary and the price will reflect that in a huge drop. If I was an insider and knew there were credible allegations against the company and under investigation by the SEC and DOJ, id'd be nervous as a buyer. #NIKOLAto$5ifiprayhardenough.

Once we have the fund set up, we can hire some WSB members as "reasearch ANALysts" to do our DD and then pay them in chicken tenders while going long chicken futures because we're going to be buying a shit ton of these fuckin things.   

From there we can pursue our degenerate gambling habits while holding impressive titles. THink of all the random ass shit we could invest in if we had our own fund. We could sell common equity on the OTC markets and get the boys to pump the shit out of em.

Hello WSB,

I want to run through a trade I made for anyone who is confused about the finer points of options trading and the mechanics of an infinite squeeze like the one we saw in TSLA, PLTR, etc.

I encourage anyone who has questions on options to ask in the comments. I see a lot of posts asking about the basics and I want to pay forward all the help I received on reddit.

Part 1: Sell Puts

I sold a GME Put at $30 for 1/15/2021. I got $1680 premium, which I used to fund the rest of my trade. Some may ask why I used this method instead of just using $3000 to buy calls? The answer is that this is to mitigate risk. If GME goes up but does not hit $30 by 1/15/2021, then some of my losses will be mitigated by the increase in the share price.

Part 2: Buy Calls

The next step was to buy 25 GME call options at $30 1/15/2021. This cost $1500, which I sourced from selling my put above. This means I control 2,500 shares of GME above the $30 price point.

Part 3: Forced Buying

Market Makers hedge the options they sell by buying 20% of the shares they have shorted in case the option ends in the money. This means that the MM who sold me those calls bought 500 shares of GME at $13.80 each. I removed $6,500 of shares from the market while only putting $1,500 on the line. As Gama changes, so will the number of shares the MMs are forced to buy as a hedge.

Part 4: The Short Squeeze to Infinity

GME already has 140% of their shares shorted. If MMs must buy shares and hold them until 1/15/2021, that makes it even more difficult for the shorts to cover. Short squeezes are violent and lead to huge increases in price. Overstock grew over 500% and VW briefly became the most valuable company due to similar strategies (Porsche literally bought tons of call options).

It is not impossible to see GME hit $100/share and maybe even $1,000/share (dream with me) since there is no precedent for a company that has this much short interest. If this occurs, then anyone who put 3K down on this trade would cash out with $2.5 Million.

Risk Mitigation

If we get a squeeze: If GME goes over $30, I will make mad money. Many retail investors will become millionaires off of GME.

If GME Stagnates: My cost basis for GME is $4.10 on 1,000 shares. Even if my calls expire worthless, that will only add $1.36/share to my cost basis. As long as we stay over $5.46, I will profit on my position. I plan to sell a few weekly CC to bring my cost basis back down to $4. I have 6 weeks to make back $1500 which means I probably only need to pledge 400 shares at .2 Delta.

If GME Crashes: Even if we crash 50%, I will be making money on the trade. I will sell CCs until my cost basis is $0.

Positions: GME short squeeze to infinity and beyond_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ I have to show someone my PLTR gains and join the club. _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ my PLTR story i had boughten one 16 call 2 weeks ago and was happy with it and held 

last week i was in bed on my phone (ToS) looking at buying x2 18 calls. Had the order ready and everything but i was hesitant and bitched out.... it‚Äôs a good thing that i was falling asleep and my thumb accidentally hit the confirm button and i snapped awake to my phone saying order filled success. 

i got scared thought about just closing then and there and decided to wait and thought what would a true autist do on ‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù purchasing calls.

yesterday finally sold all 3 calls for 2,300$ profit and i‚Äôm happy with that._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Georgia runoff e!ection is gonna rip our dicks off pt. 2 follow up to [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jq2901/georgia_runoff_eection_is_gonna_rip_our_dicks_off/). The main premise is that if senate goes blue in georgia, we're gonna run out of lube by the time the drop is over. If you check out the upside, I was right, but I was wrong in terms of the downside. Hopefully, you got in on the upside thesis. 

let's see what has happened since the last post:

- vaccine (irrelevant for this thesis, it only shifts the starting point of the crash upwards)

- yellen (inflation goes up, that's about it)

- biden seems to be shilling for corporate america still, which is a plus for republicans, but he has stated he'll campaign in georgia (my guess is that he's just saving face on this as he's pro stonks)

- the media has been disparaging towards the dem candidates, but super supportive toward the republican candidates (not surprising, they may have political biases, but b o g d a n o f f will clap their cheeks if their politics hurts stonk tendies)

- we've had an enormous run in stonks and the coin, so it's time for bad news to have a larger than life impact. E.G. nio is flagging

- no viral e!ection campaigns from ossoff have been started that I have noticed. His politics are pretty mundane, and his attacks don't really bite. He did see some viral attention when he requested a debate with perdue and pussdue pussied out. However, the MSM really dampened the virality of this event.

- trump acting like a tard, really not helping perdue


- covid ramping up again, might kill off some of the republican boomers that voted in person for trump, or at least give em a wake up call


update on data:

[These guys are usually tards, so I wouldn't put much faith in them, but it looks like ossoff is even with perdue](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/georgia/). I'm not even gonna consider laughler, there is no way that thot is winning.



If we look at vote counting:

2,462,617 for david tendie

2,374,519 for jon ostrich


871970 mail in ballots for ostrich

Just got word that "762,000 absentee ballots have already been requested in the Peach State".

I don't know about you retards, but I'm willing to bet that the majority of these initial 762000 absentee ballots are the same folks from that 871970 figure for ostrich. If ostrich just needs an additional 200k to beat out perdue, and the majority of those absentee ballots are dem, then if ostrich gets 300k more absentee ballots over the next month, perdue is practically fucked, because as I show in my previous post, it's likely that young voters will gotv in bulk on top of these absentee numbers as well. This is assuming that the in person voting ratios remain constant.


Timeline:

December 19 is when absentee ballots close for georgia. The hedge funds will most likely learn about these numbers ahead of time, so I'm guessing we're gonna see things start to get sour in a way that coincides with covid fud, so likely Dec 7 is when you should start considering selling for tax gains on anything outside of the upside plays that involve blue wave legislation. If the absentee numbers look bad on december 19, I'm getting the fuck out before the slow funds start selling off for end of month

Hope this helps, if you see anything that's wrong speak up to help autists make tendies


edit: also, just to keep in mind, upside might get fucked if the numbers start looking heavily republican, because probably a lot of the other autists out there were thinking along the same lines when I made the first post, and if the assumptions change, then people will start pulling out_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Take Reddit public via a SPAC, PIPE led by WSB Whos in?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ PLTR update- 202.56M PLTR stocks traded today(that's insane and likely fuelled by Institutional players) This is a sign that the stock is being bought not just by retail investors but also by institutional investors.

I've been an index man my whole life and done just fine. Picked a couple stocks occasionally but a couple stocks here and there doesn't make you any money so I quit it. Just recently I decided to get back into picking stocks when I started hearing abount Robinhood all the time, going for some growth/all or nothing plays. I can afford to lose a little money and I had low expectations. Well that was also the same time that I started seeing some WSB posts hit the front page. I had no fucking clue what I was laughing at but I was laughing. WSB memes are a gateway drug. 


$2,500 into RH. Bought WRK shares - a cardboard play - everyone is buying online, there is cardboard all over my house and all over my office. They were underperforming peers, got hit with the COVID, and the five of 10 bullets I read in their 10 point or whatever COVID recovery plan seemed good enough. Solid DD. Went in on Mercado Libre. Boring but solid growth. 


After laughing at all you degenerate fucks for a few months I thought to myself, yeah I should buy an option, without doing any research whatsoever. It's one option MIchael, how much could it cost? I purchased my first option. WRK $45C 12/18. Immediately went red. Didn't care. I needed more. First I had to figure out what the fuck an option was and figure out a better strategy. I knew I was ready when I could finally understand the shitposts. God damn I laugh my ass off reading this sub. And not just a little huff through the nose, like actual laughing. Joy I haven't felt in so long. 


I kept losing more on FDs. I didn't even know what an FD was. I just looked that up yesterday, but apparently that's what I was doing and I am the reason it's called an FD. In bed I would just look at who had earnings coming up and buy calls. I was getting fucked by my stupid plays. V, ACTI, ADM (what the fuck is that even? Bunch of soy bean farms. Who cares???), IP (more fucking cardboard). These stocks are not going to move. Just chipping away at my nut but I was expecting to lose so keep going right? Truly retarted. 


Then who came along? NIO. Fucking NIO. Made some money on calls while it was going from 20>30. Made back my losses and then some. Now I'm main lining heroin. Well shit now I know wtf to do right? Just do whatever WSB is doing. Now I'm staring at RH at work for 30 minutes straight thinking about selling one contract and reading posts on the shitter. Made money on CRSR. Made money on SOLO in the brief period it was popular and killed it on that trade. Now PLTR is fucking gold. I've bought and sold FDs. I'm in on a LEAP. I'm in for stock. TOüöÄ. THEüöÄ. MOON. üöÄ


Now I can't sleep sometimes thinking about my plays that day and the plays I have to monitor the next day. I spend all the god damn zoom meetings I'm in all day staring at tickers. This should not be happening given the amount of money I'm playing with. I've got no positions worth more than a couple hundred bucks. I'm losing sleep over missing out on $20. SO FUCK YOU. BUT ALSO THANKS FOR MAKING ME MONEY, GETTING ME TO LEARN SOME NEW STUFF, FEELING LIKE PART OF THE GANG, AND MOSTLY MAKING ME LAUGH. In 48 days I'm up 75% thanks to WSB (mostly PLTR). I'm going to keep building this nut a bit then YOLO that bitch into a TESLA on whatever meme stock comes next.


There was a post a few weeks ago about people making fancy posts to pump stocks and leaving my retard self holding the bag. Well fuck that. If your DD has bold, paragraphs, some üöÄüöÄüöÄ, and a position then I'm 100% in.


Positions:

Season of Giving Prize(s) Giveaway! In the spirit of the giving season that's seemingly spreading here faster than the 'rona, I'd like to celebrate the new ETF that looks oddly enough like it was made especially for / because of us.  For those of you still in the dark, I'm talking about $MOON.

$MOON is the Direxion Moonshot Innovators ETF that tracks the S&P Kensho Moonshots Index.  The S&P Kensho Moonshots Index is designed to measure the performance of 50 U.S.-listed companies with the highest Early-Stage Composite Innovation Score, subject to market capitalization and liquidity criteria, that produce the products and services shaping our future.  Basically, it's a YOLO ETF.  Holdings can be found [here](https://www.direxion.com/product/moonshot-innovators-etf).  Looking at those holdings, if you feel targeted, good, because you are.

Anyway, onto the giveaway!

**If $MOON goes to the moon & closes at or above $40/share on 12/31/20**, 1 lucky commenter will receive a new gaming PC valued around $1,000.  Currently, the front runner is the [Skytech Shiva](https://www.amazon.com/SkyTech-Shiva-Gaming-Computer-Desktop/dp/B07RPCG8ZW/), but I'll ultimately select a highly rated gaming PC with relatively good specs.

**If $MOON goes to Mars & closes at or above $50/share on 12/31/20**, 2 lucky commenters will receive either the previously mentioned gaming PC or a complete [Valve Index VR Kit](https://store.steampowered.com/sub/354231/).  If both winners want the gaming PC, OK.  If both winners want the Valve Index VR kit, OK.  I'm not going to force 1 winner to take 1 prize and the other winner to take the other prize.

**If $MOON goes to Alpha Centauri & closes at or above $60/share on 12/31/20**, 3 lucky commenters will receive either the previously mentioned gaming PC or Valve Index VR kit, or a [$1,000 Lovehoney gift certificate](https://www.lovehoney.com/giftvoucher-purchase).  No kink shame; do with it what you will.  Once again, each winner will get to pick any of the 3 different prizes they want.

**How do you enter?**  Comment a top comment; simple as that.

**How do you win?**  Winners will be randomly selected after 4 PM EST 12/31/20 via [RedditRaffler](https://www.redditraffler.com/).  This post will be edited with a link to drawing results.

**What do you do if you win?**  Message me if I don't message you.  At the very least I'll need an address to ship to.

I've never done a giveaway like this, but this depressing pandemic & the FOMO of other giveaways makes me want to do something fun.  Please let me know what questions you have, and I'll try to edit them into this post.  GLHF, my fellow degenerate gamblers!_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Boomer stock go BRRRRRRRRRRRR Thoughts on GE? You dorks might be missing out. Stonk been upgraded to 12._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ No more FOMO - We'll come pick you up! _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ LGVW/Butterfly Networks a soon to be Meme Stonk Alright retards (TL;DR below) - Chinese EV and PLTR fever have taken over the sub and justifiably so. Since we have the attention span of a gnat, we need to find the next meme stonk. Enter Bill Gates, Butterfly Networks, and Long View Acquisition Corp.

What is it? Butterfly networks primary product is backed by Bill Gates (former second richest man on Earth) and is a handheld ultra sound machine that will improve medical diagnosis capabilities in the US and around the World.

How much does it cost?  The primary ultra sound machine has multiple packages but the best plan costs 3K one time cost that gets you the machine and the subscriptions service. They also have other plans that are based on a yearly subscription (not relevant for math purposes later). 

Company Basics. The company has $64.5M in revenue per year and has several competitors, none of which are backed by Bill Gates. The company is 9 years old and has received $350M in funding. They are merging with LGVW via a SPAC deal like so many companies this year and they have an actual product (looking at the incestuous loser Trevor Milton).

Why you should give a Fuck? Were going to mess around with some math (google research) to show how much money this company could make.

* There are 6,146 hospitals in the United States
* There are 230,187 private practices in the US
* There are an additional 164,500 hospitals world wide
   * Including 69,000 hospitals in India
   * and 30,000 hospitals in China

My sister is a nurse and she says that this is "the coolest shit ever, but it will get lost easily" so that means hospitals will be all about this shit and potentially have to buy more units when it gets lost in the anal probe repository. In other words, the tech itself is legit and this makes doctors/nurses/technicians lives easier. Lets do some numbers.

* Now, the average hospital (sister knowledge) has between 5-20 ultrasound machines floating threw a hospital.
   * If every hospital in the US had 5 machines that's $92M in revenue
* There's an additional 230K private practices in the United States
   * If each private practice had 1 machine, that's $690M
* Now, lets talk about international
   * There's estimated to be 164,500 hospitals worldwide which adds up to an additional $493M
   * Additionally, Doctors, missions, nonprofits, and other organizations could buy one pushing the market even higher by millions.

Simply put, this is an absolute cash cow in the making with the deal expected to close in Q1 of next year. All told the shitty end of my retard math estimates $1.275B in revenue on the low end and an even higher TAM. That doesn't even price in the retard strength when the WSB/robinhood hedge funds start getting involved and fucking around with it. LGVW closed at 17.39 with another 1% gain in aftermarket trading. Given the SPAC craze on the market, LGVW should have no problem heading towards the moon over the next few months.

Positions: Long LGVW with 263 shares, will buy more as capital becomes available.

**TL;DR Buy LGVW shares and calls. Bill Gates backs this company and he knows a thing or two about money. Their technology and capabilities are legit and its the ground floor of a fturistic med tech company. Buy before it becomes a meme.

You probably know of blackberry as the phone company but they've pivoted to EV and CyberSec.

So XPEV, the company that went from $18-70+? BB is under the hood.

Arrival that went from $12 to $30 $CIIC, BB is under the hood.

They've also partnered with Plus, and a bunch of other automotive companies ala Jaguar/Ford.

Elon Musk ring a bell? BB is under the hood of SpaceX.
http://imgur.com/a/IVp6ORT



They've integrated athoc in Microsoft teams. I'm in devOps, teams is the future. 

They've partnered with Zoom to create an enterprise version of the app, caveat being they named it poorly so people think it's what's made for blackberry phones.

Some other partners:

Bell Canada, ServiceNow, Space force, Canadian Gov, Amazon, Canoo, Qcomm


More good news:

Patents, they're one of the largest patent holding companies in the world.
Rumour has it that they're selling most of it.

Heard of Facebook and messenger?

They just recently lost a patent battle in November to blackberry that disallows them from switching from games to messaging apps.


The revenue story:

They "only" make 800-1b annually, about what Palantir makes IIRC.

    This quarter should be interesting because of the hiring of Tom from Citrix.


Why they haven't mooned yet:

--They're regarded as the phone company

--No rev growth yet

Just wanted to remind everyone that possibly in a week or two, if PLTR actually see a very small red day, any speck of red, even 0.04%, we will see hundreds of threads an hour from all the bearrorists, screaming as loud as they can about "HAHA FUCKING DUMBASSES BULLS, I TOLD YOU PLTR WOULD COME CRASHING?$@#& SOON, WHO'S FUCKED NOW BULLS HAHA WHERE IS YOUR PLTR NOW?" just like when TSLA dipped a little bit a couple months ago (yea I know, hard to believe, but it was dipping for a day or two). That shit was so annoying, and this time won't be any different. 

When they come out to celebrate the only red day of the month, most of us will be busy on the phone ordering our new tesla, some their new pink lambo.

Again, I know it's gonna be very cringe to see all those fucking bearrorist posts, thinking they're hurting our feelings, while in the meantime we're only annoyed because we can't count our profits quickly enough because of all their constant shitposts.

So yea, just wanted to say in advance, fuck you you fucking bearrorist, you're not being edgy or funny, go back into hibernation.

In this paragraph I would write something like, PLTR by all rights should correct but it wont because Elon Musk can flick peanuts off his dick into his robot wifes mouth and that means it won‚Äôt happen so all you autist will be rich if we keep buying the stupid shit company no one knows anything about except it prints money for us.
