 Poor people can do it too. Pltr 29c 12/4 _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ APXT: Buy Puts! _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Long Weed but Do NOT buy ACB  My fellow autists,

Happy thanksgiving you retards. Despite 2020 being by far the worst year in a long fucking time, there is plenty to be thankful for. I‚Äôm thankful for not being retarded enough to invest in ACB. For those of you less fortunate, let me explain.

In case you haven‚Äôt expanded the historical price chart view for ACB to further beyond a month yet, ACB has been on a one-way road down to dumpster land, and for good reason. This does NOT mean it‚Äôs prime for a ripping or that it is ‚Äúundervalued.‚Äù 

\*\*\* Begin Analysis, feel free to skip \*\*\*

The company has historically been mismanaged. What once began as a pioneer in the cannabis market has now become the laughing stock of the cannabis giants. While the overall market grows at 30%, ACB has struggled on aligning on an effective sales strategy, even with a new CEO. They‚Äôve historically focused on value (cheap) flower, which has lost demand as it continues to face steeper competition. Shifts to higher premium brands resulted in declines in revenue (ACB is basically the only cannabis company to have declining revenue) despite significantly higher investment costs. ACB‚Äôs early enthusiasm resulted in significant capacity that has since been recognized to far exceed demand (currently <20% utilization on its initial capacity), hampered by restrictive international policies around issuance of prescriptions. This excess capacity has resulted in declining cannabis prices, creating a double whammy for ACB.

These dynamics have led to a woeful financial picture. ACB burns $50-100M in cash a quarter. At least it‚Äôs for solid ROI investments right? Well let‚Äôs see‚Ä¶revenue went down this year across both medical and recreational as mentioned, gross margins continue to deteriorate (60% to -25%), and the business generates negative $3.4B in net income (and it continues to decline YoY). The last stat is largely due to a ‚Äúwrite off of a few investments‚Äù. What that means is they closed a bunch of facilities, scrapped a shit-ton of inventory, and acknowledged that the companies they bought along the way were way too overvalued. ACB recently had an equity raise at $7.50 / share to raise $125M in an attempt to stay afloat. These processes take a ton of time. Instead of managing the business, management was likely spending most of their time for the past quarter marketing and getting investors to buy this junk. And once that money runs out in a quarter or two, they‚Äôll likely try to do an even more sizeable equity raise (read: even more dilution for shareholders) to any unsophisticated investor willing to listen.

But what about federal legalization? Sorry to be a Debbie Downer, but it‚Äôs not happening anytime soon fellas. Biden has never been about it and I‚Äôd bet my left nut that Republicans hold onto the senate. While the democrat‚Äôs relatively liberal stance on the issue might allow for more widespread decriminalization, federal approval is needed to Aurora to enter the US THC market due to current regulations. And even on the off chance that marijuana becomes legalized federally, Aurora suffers from such a poor balance sheet that they may not even be able to afford to break into the market and take share from the existing well-capitalized, better run domestic incumbents.

Despite the gross mismanagement of the business, lackluster financial performance, poor regulatory outlook, and the massive drop in stock price over the year(s), the company continues to trade at a whopping 7x TEV/Revenue. Your grandkids will likely be dead before this thing ever sees a dollar on the bottom line). At 7x, the company trades like a high growth SaaS tech company, when in reality the company is on the brink of bankruptcy. It currently has twice as much debt as it does revenue, burns through $300M cash annually as mentioned above, and has only been able to stay afloat recently through equity raises which continue to get increasingly dilutive and unsustainable as the cash burn grows larger and the equity becomes more worthless. There are no debt sources (banks) or other institutional equity investors that would ever lend to this company.

\*\*\* End Rant, Feel free to Skip to Here \*\*\*

For those of you who skipped the last few paragraphs because there was too much autistic jargon in there, let me explain it to you with an example. Let‚Äôs say Pi Phi is the hottest sorority on your campus. If Pi Phi is a proxy for the weed industry, then Aurora is one of the founding members who used to only be kind of hot as she got her bid‚Ä¶.then she got freshman fifteen, and is now about to get the sophomore 30. In an attempt to avoid getting retrohosed, she got lipo from the few willing doctors that were around at the expense of her health and family‚Äôs wealth. Unfortunately that lipo is only going to last a semester before it all comes right back. Moral: Go for Pi Phis, just not Aurora

In case it wasn‚Äôt made clear in the above example, this post is not meant to be a negative piece on the cannabis industry. I‚Äôm a strong believer in marijuana. It‚Äôs a $20B legal, $200B recreational market with a 30% projected revenue CAGR for the next few years. With the farm bill legalizing CBD, the market continues to move closer to decriminalization and legalization. Hell, this took me forever to write because I took a 10mg edible, had 5 snack breaks, and watched three episode of the Office then fell asleep last night before waking up this morning (read: afternoon) to finish writing. I don‚Äôt think I need to explain to you all that this is the future. All I‚Äôm advocating for is to invest your money in other weed stocks, not ACB because it looks cheap.

Aurora has the sporadic 30%-100% stock price jump days. For example: when announcing a new CEO, democrats winning the election, trump conceding the election, and retail FOMO/hedge fund squeezes. None of which did jack for the company fundamentally. But don‚Äôt be fooled by these dead cat bounces. You will get burned trying to chase these jumps, and if you‚Äôre buying calls, then the frat Vega Delta Theta will surely fuck you after fucking your wife, your wife‚Äôs boyfriend, and the non-fat chicks at Pi Phi. 

I‚Äôm also not advocating you to buy puts on this company. The economics on a put are abysmal, believe me I have one. Just don‚Äôt buy this shit expecting to get rich quick.

My Opinion:

This company on October 29 was at $13 and now with the recent spike it just hit $25. I had this on my watch list and was pissed about missing out on the opportunity. This company is for sure to boom if we have another lockdown in our possession. This is your go to Pandemic stock, this is where the bulls will breed. Easily will top **$30** before 2020.

I looked at some numbers and they are reported to have 4b in revenue and are growing at over an 80% YoY. 

That‚Äôs more than Shopify which is valued at 120b and Square that‚Äôs valued at 100b. 

For comparison, Palantir has only 1b in revenue and loosing 900m and is valued at almost 50b. 

We thinking 140b is possible? 

Did some research and saw that $PSTH is backed by 

Guggenheim $500m

Seth Klarman $400m

Soroban Capital $256m

Wells Fargo $300m

It recently bottomed out, just started recovering, and now were left with an easy way to 5x our money simply by pressing the "buy" button on calls. Way easier than making $10/hr at wendys even with the frequent $50 bonuses from sucking cock back behind the dumpster. Currently it closed at $448.45, meanwhile every single analyst has been giving it a price target above $500 since mid october with the most recent rating being $550. Their profits are fucking soaring and they're literally the biggest company in their industry which is selling expensive, fancy, scientific lab equipment to rich nerds.

The closest/biggest competitor I could find (Agilent Technologies) has 1/5th of TMO's gross revenue while TMO also has higher profit margins than Agilent which also has multibillion dollar revenue. Every other competitor I found has around 1/10th the revenue or less, so TMO basically cornered the market here while second place is in this industry might as well be last place because TMO already won years ago.

Before any smooth brains point out that InSiDeRs sOlD $71m last quarter, insiders have been selling every quarter for several years so they can afford their big mansions, lambos, and yachts while the entire time the company has been growing faster than my mother's terminal cancer. Most recent insider sale was like 31 days ago anyway when the CEO sold less than 0.5% of the shares he owned for $4,799,400

This shit is way oversold, skipping the road to recovery and jumping on the mission to moon town back above $500+ easily in the near future. Likely mid $500s and over $600 a few months later.

Positions I'm adding Friday morning:

3/19/21 $500c - buying a couple of these but they cost twice as much as January calls so January calls are better. I'm only buying 2 or 3 of these so I dont miss out on any February/early March mooning action

1/15/21 $600 calls - Get your big dick lottery tickets right here boys.

Let‚Äôs all make the most of our donations this holiday season. The best way to donate to charity is to send them your best performing shares of stock. That way you don‚Äôt pay taxes on any of your gains, and the charity is allowed to sell the stock immediately upon receipt and they don‚Äôt pay any taxes either. 

Steps to do this: 
1.	Find the charity‚Äôs brokerage account information online or send them a message asking for it. The instructions should include information to perform a Depository Trust Corporation (DTC) transfer 
2.	Call your broker or send them a secure message online to provide them with the DTC instructions, including the ticker symbol, number of shares, and specifically which shares or all shares of a stock holding that you‚Äôre looking to donate
3.	Your brokerage will take a few hours up to a few days, and the shares will disappear from your account. The charity will then send you a receipt for the entire value of shares that you sent them, which is tax deductible against the rest of your tendies for the year

Example scenario:
I bought $2k shares of NIO that are up 200%. I donated the $6k of stock to charity, so instead of having to pay taxes on $4k in gains I instead get to deduct the entire $6k on my taxes.

Example of a few DTC instructions for charities:

1.	Food bank example since it‚Äôs the holidays/Thanksgiving - Food Bank of Silicon Valley: https://www.shfb.org/give-help/stock-gifts/
2.	The founder of the ice bucket challenge passed away last weekend, so you could also give to ALS research (Lou Gehrig‚Äôs disease). This is a disease that has personally impacted my family as well: https://www.als.org/get-involved/ways-give/information-securities-brokers

Caveats: 
1.	Some of the newer, smaller brokers might not be setup to donate shares via DTC, so you‚Äôll have to check with your broker to see if it will work. All of the traditional brokers like eTrade, Fidelity, etc are setup to handle this process
2.	Options are not a good idea to send because of the potential volatility and liquidity that is forced upon the charity. So more liquid, straightforward instruments like regular common stock such has PLTR, NIO, GME is the best way to donate

 PS. The ultimate charitable gift is to buy more shares of PLTR to raise all of WSB out of poverty

Edit: looks like it‚Äôs also better if you‚Äôve owned the shares for more than a year. Otherwise you can only deduct your cost basis, but you still get to avoid paying taxes on the gains either way.

What about an equivalent in Europe ?

A new company just get inside the MSCI Smallcaps Index, and this is Mcphy Energy (MCPHY).

McPhy Energy specialises in the manufacture and marketing of equipment for the production and storage of hydrogen in solid form from the electrolysis of water. The group offers electrolysers, storage containers and integrated solutions for the energy, industry and transport sectors. The company has 3 production site in Germany, France and Italy.

&#x200B;

1. Numbers :

I have not carried out a very thorough fundamental analysis knowing in advance that, although the company is almost 12 years old, it still has a start-up model and that the sector, although growing rapidly, is still not very profitable. A basic comparison with its two major competitors may simply suggest that it has room for improvement:

Nel ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ITM Power ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† McPhycapi M‚Ç¨¬† ¬† 1300¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† 500¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† 100CA M‚Ç¨¬† ¬†¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† 47¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† 15¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† 11

Its 2019 revenues are up 43% to ‚Ç¨11.4 million compared with ‚Ç¨8 million in 2018. It has strengthened its shareholders' equity and has a cash position of ‚Ç¨13 million at 31 December 2019, notably following the success of the capital increase by private placement carried out last November.

&#x200B;

2) Strategically :

McPhy has chosen alkaline technology for its electrolysers, which is older and slightly less efficient than the PEM technology with Proton Exchange Membrane chosen by ITM Power, but less expensive and therefore more immediately profitable for the customer.

On the other hand, McPhy had originally built its model on its proprietary solid hydrogen storage technology. However, this technology has not been commercially convincing in 10 years (PoliticalAnimal had already pointed out 4 years ago the fragility of this model in the face of the number of alternative solutions in the McPhy queue). They have therefore finally chosen to abandon this path in December 2018 and concentrate on electrolysis. The good results of 2019 (a year of transition, therefore) are undoubtedly in large part due to this change of strategy and bode well for 2020.

3) Last news :

McPhy Energy announced in October the launch of a ‚Ç¨150 million capital increase. A lightning operation, completed during the night, the amount of which has moreover been increased to 180 million euros. The operation was reserved for major investors

&#x200B;

I think to invest in ITM Power (ITM) could be a good idea the price is still really low.

I was doing some research in PLTR, and I noticed the price target is super fucked, like [18 is highest](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/PLTR/research-ratings) .

Aditionally, like another post mentioned, there are only [12.29% institutional ownership](https://fintel.io/so/us/pltr) . That, in my eyes, meabs 2 things. We control it, so it will snowball up probablly, but if institutional dump, paper hands will dump too. It could really go either way. Now I don't see any reason to dump, but it just seems kinda weird.

That said, I made over 200% on my CFDs since last week, so I'm not complaining, I'm just curious why it's like this. No doubt it will go up more, but really this growth may not be sustainable, and I feel like at some point there will be a huge correction. Either that or the boomers will go full retard and put it on a colision trajectory with Voyager, sending it out of our solar sistem.

Pos 60 CFD long @ $18.66, I'm poor but that's the point of all of this right?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ BCRX possible short squeeze incoming Forgive the lack of karma, there was an... unfortunate incident with my main account, but I couldn't bear to deprive you of this hot piece of DD on this day of giving thanks, and giving back to you who have given so much to me. 

BCRX, aka Biocryst, has several promising drugs in their pipeline: Berotralstat/Orledayo, Galidesivir, and BCX9930. Galidesivir, an oral alternative to Remdesivir with potential for COVID treatment, had some hype, but there's been radio silence on that front. 

Orledayo is the relevant one here though. FDA approval (aka PDUFA) is scheduled for December 3.  Several other drugs with a Dec 3 PDUFA date have already been approved though, so the news could come at any moment. Early access has already been granted in the UK, so there's reason to be optimistic about approval. In other words, the time to get in on this play is market open tomorrow. Japan approval will come sometimein December and EU approval in Q1 of 2021. 

Orledayo is the first ever oral treatment for Hereditary Angioedema. Competing drugs are all IV-administered. Which would you choose? HAE affects only 1 in every 50,000 people, but surveys indicate that 71% of patients are willing to make the switch. With insurers paying out 500k per patient per year, the revenue potential is huge, and Biocryst has the infrastructure to get Orledayo out there extremely quickly. The company's own conservative estimate is $500 million of revenue per year, but there's the potential for closer to $2 billion. 

Relative to that potential, BCRX is quite undervalued. It's been heavily shorted for the simple reason that the company hasn't yet developed a successful drug. 41 million shares are short right now out of a total float of 110 million. That's not quite Gamestop-level numbers, but it's significant. In other words, this baby's gonna SQUEEZE. I'm predicting $8, maybe higher on FDA approval. 

Positions: $4c 12/18/20 and $4c 3/19/21. Dec 18 $5c and $4.50c are stupid cheap so that's the position I would take tomorrow. 

TLDR: FDA approval for Orledayo incoming SOON. Gonna squeeze the üåàüêª shorts. Dec 18 $5 and $4.50 calls are stupid cheap, BUY._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Whats going on with PLTR?

I keep an eye on a lot of scientific development. A lot. You cucks watch porn or wait for losses here to beat off, I read about metallurgy and protein folding for my erections.

This is the first significant breakthrough for hydrogen production that I've seen that will price it as cheap or even cheaper than upcoming battery tech, and it can be scaled in the near future for production.

Hydrogen finally has a way forward and will eventually completely replace the oil industry, being used mostly for heavy industry, while EV's dominate the consumer market.

Hydrogen fuel cells are the easy part, cheap and abundant Hydrogen was the biggest part of the puzzle. That's taken care of now.

LEAPs on any hydrogen or fuel cell company you think has good financials is the play. Buy a few with your boomer investment money and watch them turn into 20 baggers over the next year or two.

Plenty of time to get in since this is a long haul investment, and keep an eye out for any companies that haven't already devoted their resources to another hydrogen source, they will for sure pick this up and dickslap the competition. I haven't seen anything else that has the potential to be this cheap on the horizon._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ SIR, THIS IS A MCDONALDS. _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Is This a Trap? With PLTR's insane üöÄ and Cramer et al absolutely losing their shit, I wonder how long it'll be until the big money institutional investors try to teach us a lesson.

I'm poor as fuck, but if I had more than two zeros in my account this is how I'd do it:

1. Let a meme stock take off
2. Buy what the dumbasses are selling. Encourage the hype machine.
3. Let it go on long enough that even the wary investors, those who started with just $100 or even $1000 invested start pouring in everything they've got. 
4. Once it looks like enough "traders" are "all in," they've maxed out their credit cards, liquidated their other positions ... there's literally no more money left for them to gamble - and I own enough of the stock now to pretty much control the market - I sell everything.
5. What started as a gold rush instantly becomes a flash crash. The memers watch their "investments" melt away, as I flood the market and drown them all.

So yeah. I guess, be careful out there boys. This could be a trap.

TD;LR CALLS on $PSTH_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ PSA: Shut the fuck up about future meme stocks Look fellow autists. If you‚Äôve been sifting through the sea of weak gain porn and this Randy Marsh nut size of $PLTR posts for the next train - WSB has two upcoming meme stocks in the pipeline. Here‚Äôs the problem you motherfuckers don‚Äôt understand. The more we talk about it, the more algos and non-retards will pick up our scent. The goal is to retard strength a stock up, then have the big pockets scope out the movement and boost to the moon üöÄ It‚Äôs our job to start the party. 

Here are some personal invitations to some IPO rocket parties that will print harder than Daddy JPow needing to return an Amazon package. 

1. *oblox - This bad boy company is going to shit money for all of us if we can keep it quiet. Their IPO is gonna hit some time mid-December and if you know anything about this sub, we‚Äôre gonna be doing mountain of cocaine the second it hits Robinhood because that hype train will be stronger than you could ever imagine. No DD because fuck you. 

2. *ffrirm - Okay this is a legit company with some legit stats. You waiting for some options to print but still want to buy that $900 swing set to fuck hookers on? This company is that sexy ‚ÄúBuy Now, Pay Later‚Äù shit you‚Äôre seeing everytime you hit the checkout menu. Only pay $90/mo for 10 months and by that time you better have broken the swing. This company has Peloton, Paypal, and Shopify backing it. If you‚Äôve been here long enough your dick should start tickling already. This is looking to moon so don‚Äôt miss the hype. 

Was this post well thought out? No. Do I care? No. Am I right? Check this in January and find out. 

TL;DR - Shut the fuck up about future meme stocks - read between the posts._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ OXY Gain Porn & Happy Thanksgiving _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Thread of notable IPOs offering price and their gains/losses since.. Rocket buyers don't click _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ @Jim Cramer - *Throws down the gauntlet* https://preview.redd.it/mhn1p3nhfl161.png?width=1646&format=png&auto=webp&s=5d74a072b4fb889c4a233b272d63507965673e88

Sup?

So we know you have your unpaid interns lurk our boards.  We're gonna need you to stop talking shit on us on CNBC.  Why?  Cause we can buy and sell CNBC 3x over and we don't want boomers in here breeding gay bears.  You remind me of Matthew Mcconaughey when he gets that job in Two For the Money and realizes he's a big fake and just flips a coin.

We the millennial investors have something none of you boomers will ever have, "Weaponized Autism".  All we have to do is post rocket ship emojis and a ticker and our profits go up 100% every week.  We all watched 2k people die on TV on 9/11 when our lizard brains were developing and we all know we live in a simulation.  Money has no value to us it is a construct that can simply be YOLO'd to make more.  We trade on our phones in bed and on the toilet.   If we lose for the week? we get modded and are kings here in our community.  Then we just do it again on our next Wendy's paycheck until we hit 6 figures.

&#x200B;

We aren't hedge fund manager or CEOs, we didn't go to IV league schools because our daddies were rich. We are your janitors, your burger flippers, the people who wash your cars.  You all probably trade on TD Ameritrade on Internet explorer.  Our low IQ big Balls have carried us with months of stock trading experience vs you flipping dot coms in the 90s. The boomer way of life is ending and we are carrying a big white board that says "fuck you Gay Bear Boomers".

That being said, I'll wager against your boomer stocks the best and brightest of WSB has to offer against yourself and a hand picked team of 4 other members.  5 v 5.  Highest portfolio wins for Q1 2021.  Must start with $1,000 Balance, gains from Jan 1 - Mach 31st.

What we have at stake; (this is wallstreetbets after all)

If we win (*which is a guran-fucking-tee.)*  You take the 5 WSB members and give them 100k a year to work from home for 10 years contract, 1million dollar buyout break-early and they will feed you meme stocks and maybe you won't be replaced by one of us next year.

If we lose, I will personally come to CNBC hive-mind and appear on your show and kiss your ass on TV how you are a legend and i'll wear a banana suit that ways "WSB Investor " in black sharpie.

I have a put to sell at $30, price for the put is $5.

SO i sell at my put of $30 and pay the $5. My account is now worth $25

This has created a phenomenon of rising demand for $TSLA.  The supply has so far remained fixed. Whatever price you buy $TSLA for now, you can sell it to the index funds (even if the price is higher) from December 18. But wait, it doesn't stop there.

The higher $TSLA rises, the more of Tesla's float index funds would have to buy. The more of Tesla's float index funds would have to buy, the higher $TSLA would get bid up. This has created a positive feedback loop driving Tesla's share prices higher. *The higher $TSLA rises, the higher $TSLA will rise*. There is no obvious place this stops as the index funds **have to buy** $TSLA. Something that might break the positive feedback loop is if Tesla issued new shares. An increase in supply with the same level of demand would drive the price down.

In the 7 trading days since the S&P 500 inclusion announcement, $TSLA has risen on all but one of them and has appreciated 40%. When the S&P 500 announced Tesla's inclusion, index funds needed to buy only $51 billion, now Barron estimates they need to buy around $70 billion worth of $TSLA and 2 million extra shares.

The good news (or bad news for some $TSLA speculators) is that reason would return to $TSLA's price post December 21. The speculators would sell off the $TSLA they bought to the index funds, and the crazy feedback loop would end. However, that wouldn't necessarily be all. Indexers only need to buy a fixed amount of $TSLA. If the speculators overbought $TSLA (bought more $TSLA than the index funds need), they would find that they are unable to sell all their $TSLA to the index funds. They would be left holding the bag so to speak. These speculators may then try to get rid of the $TSLA they have by setting even lower bid prices, and this should drive the price down. **The extent to which speculators overbought $TSLA relative to the demand from indexers and benchmarkers would determine the drop in $TSLA post December 21.**

If you want to short $TSLA, I think short term puts bought on December 21 would be sensible. $TSLA should drop after December 21. It's not clear how far the drop would be, but there would likely be some drop. Before then, for a brief moment in time, Tesla would be the US' sixth or fifth most valuable company and Musk might be the world's richest man._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ The SSSS guy must be really pissed _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ PLTR trendies source - if you guys are wondering where the money is coming from ü•¶üçåüå∂ü•öüçîüå≠ü´ê. 500 bought at 16 sold at 20 for 1.20 premium.

Questions:

Since a rush could happen much closer to the inclusion date, is there still time for a dip prior to \~12/21? Could it fall and hover at 520 for a week then moon again?

Or is it probable that Tesla just keeps going up (with a dip occasionally) until inclusion?

Or has it just finally been valued as more than a car company and the price won't shift much though inclusion?

I have made a killing in PLTR but there's another stock that's not talked about at all with many surprising factors. 

MP Materials just gone public via SPAC with Fortress Value Acquisition Corp.   Let's just start with what REE is.   REE is rare earth elements,  I won't go into the details but basically think of permanent magnets.   They are used in  fighter jets,  MRI,  Cellphones etc.    Most importantly what we autist love to hear is they are in EVs and wind turbines which is the hottest sectors right now other than weed.  

I won't go into too much details because you autist with add get lost after the first paragraphs at best.  But as of now the whole market is completely dominated by China and that's why Trump signed an executive order to bring REE supply chain back to domestic at all cost.   This will continue regardless of Biden or Trump because it is crucial for the development of the important industries as well as defense.  China has threatened to cut US off from these precious metals and has done so with Japan for disputes in 2010. 

As of now everything, I mean 100%, is sent back to China and it is refined and turned into alloys and oxides then sent back.   If America want to make EV and turbines domestically the demand is huge.   This is a EV long term play so get in early. 


Why MP?  There are so many REE companies out there? 

- MONOPOLY domestic play. Actually have a functional mine from bankruptcy before.  Now it is under new management and is actually functional unlike other companies.   If you know anything about mining you would know to get a mine functional would take 5 to 10 years not even counting infrastructure.    The REE price is so low to compete we won't be seeing any real competition soon because it is not cost effective to develop a mine. Most REE companies are just a dream where they suddenly wake up and get grants from DOD and everything just magically happens into a 10 bagger overnight.  Only other real non Chinese competitor is Lynas but they are Aussie owned. 

- MP is one of the world's biggest mine in the world

- 1 of 3 companies to receive grants from Pentagon.  9. 6 million for seperation capabilities enhancement

- Phase 2 of 170million to upgrade to produce oxides and magnets

- Investors include Chamath, omega advisors & Slate path capital

- Third quarter revenue grew 52%; net income yoy increased 4x to 14. 6 million ,  adjusted EBITDA grew 159% yoy to 11. 6 million

- LOTS of factors such as EV, defense, China, and solar play all incorporated into one!!  Does it get batter than this?

I can buy 50 puts and have enough cash left over to hopefully build up my account responsibly if this goes tits up. So, the recent run up of Nikola price can be attributed to hope around the GM deal being possible still, but I think people have to come to terms that its not happening. On November 9th on the Nikola website was still linked to the gm deal, but on Nov 11 it was changed and removed any sign of it and the badger. This can lead to a one likely outcome, the deal is done for, with Nikola not wanting to pursue the badger and instead focus on its core business or that GM wants too much from Nikola. With a deal not done by Dec 3rd either company can walk away. I think the probability of this is quite high. On top of this the lockup period for early investors will unlock and there are no assurances from Trevor Milton wont sell his shares, sure a couple of insider have extended there lockup period , but with the possibility come dec 1st that a large amount of insiders will have the ability to possibly dump over 100million shares thats scary and the price will reflect that in a huge drop. If I was an insider and knew there were credible allegations against the company and under investigation by the SEC and DOJ, id'd be nervous as a buyer. #NIKOLAto$5ifiprayhardenough.

This may seem too hard for a bunch of retards, but I believe we can do it. All we need is some BS powerpoint presentations (boomers love these even if they don't know how to make them) on how we are a "contrarian" fund. While in reality the only thing we're contrarian to is common sense.

Once we have the fund set up, we can hire some WSB members as "reasearch ANALysts" to do our DD and then pay them in chicken tenders while going long chicken futures because we're going to be buying a shit ton of these fuckin things.   

From there we can pursue our degenerate gambling habits while holding impressive titles. THink of all the random ass shit we could invest in if we had our own fund. We could sell common equity on the OTC markets and get the boys to pump the shit out of em. The whole entire thing would be an endless loop of hype and pumps and we'd easily mint a few billy for the fund partners no problem.

Hello WSB,

I want to run through a trade I made for anyone who is confused about the finer points of options trading and the mechanics of an infinite squeeze like the one we saw in TSLA, PLTR, etc.

I encourage anyone who has questions on options to ask in the comments. I see a lot of posts asking about the basics and I want to pay forward all the help I received on reddit.

Part 1: Sell Puts

I sold a GME Put at $30 for 1/15/2021. I got $1680 premium, which I used to fund the rest of my trade. Some may ask why I used this method instead of just using $3000 to buy calls? The answer is that this is to mitigate risk. If GME goes up but does not hit $30 by 1/15/2021, then some of my losses will be mitigated by the increase in the share price.

Part 2: Buy Calls

The next step was to buy 25 GME call options at $30 1/15/2021. This cost $1500, which I sourced from selling my put above. This means I control 2,500 shares of GME above the $30 price point.

Part 3: Forced Buying

Market Makers hedge the options they sell by buying 20% of the shares they have shorted in case the option ends in the money. This means that the MM who sold me those calls bought 500 shares of GME at $13.80 each. I removed $6,500 of shares from the market while only putting $1,500 on the line. As Gamma changes, so will the number of shares the MMs are forced to buy as a hedge.

Part 4: The Short Squeeze to Infinity

GME already has 140% of their shares shorted. If MMs must buy shares and hold them until 1/15/2021, that makes it even more difficult for the shorts to cover. Short squeezes are violent and lead to huge increases in price. Overstock grew over 500% and VW briefly became the most valuable company due to similar strategies (Porsche literally bought tons of call options).

It is not impossible to see GME hit $100/share and maybe even $1,000/share (dream with me) since there is no precedent for a company that has this much short interest. If this occurs, then anyone who put 3K down on this trade would cash out with $2.5 Million.

Risk Mitigation

If we get a squeeze: If GME goes over $30, I will make mad money. Many retail investors will become millionaires off of GME.

If GME Stagnates: My cost basis for GME is $4.10 on 1,000 shares. Even if my calls expire worthless, that will only add $1.36/share to my cost basis. As long as we stay over $5.46, I will profit on my position. I plan to sell a few weekly CC to bring my cost basis back down to $4. I have 6 weeks to make back $1500 which means I probably only need to pledge 400 shares at .2 Delta.

If GME Crashes: Even if we crash 50%, I will be making money on the trade. I will sell CCs until my cost basis is $0.

Positions: GME short squeeze to infinity and beyond

i got scared thought about just closing then and there and decided to wait and thought what would a true autist do on ‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù purchasing calls.

The main premise is that if senate goes blue in georgia, we're gonna run out of lube by the time the drop is over. If you check out the upside, I was right, but I was wrong in terms of the downside. Hopefully, you got in on the upside thesis. 

let's see what has happened since the last post:

- vaccine (irrelevant for this thesis, it only shifts the starting point of the crash upwards)

- yellen (inflation goes up, that's about it)

- biden seems to be shilling for corporate america still, which is a plus for republicans, but he has stated he'll campaign in georgia (my guess is that he's just saving face on this as he's pro stonks)

- the media has been disparaging towards the dem candidates, but super supportive toward the republican candidates (not surprising, they may have political biases, but b o g d a n o f f will clap their cheeks if their politics hurts stonk tendies)

- we've had an enormous run in stonks and the coin, so it's time for bad news to have a larger than life impact. E.G. nio is flagging

- no viral e!ection campaigns from ossoff have been started that I have noticed. His politics are pretty mundane, and his attacks don't really bite. He did see some viral attention when he requested a debate with perdue and pussdue pussied out. However, the MSM really dampened the virality of this event.

- trump acting like a tard, really not helping perdue


- covid ramping up again, might kill off some of the republican boomers that voted in person for trump, or at least give em a wake up call


update on data:

[These guys are usually tards, so I wouldn't put much faith in them, but it looks like ossoff is even with perdue](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/georgia/). I'm not even gonna consider laughler, there is no way that thot is winning.



If we look at vote counting:

2,462,617 for david tendie

2,374,519 for jon ostrich


871970 mail in ballots for ostrich

Just got word that "762,000 absentee ballots have already been requested in the Peach State".

I don't know about you retards, but I'm willing to bet that the majority of these initial 762000 absentee ballots are the same folks from that 871970 figure for ostrich. If ostrich just needs an additional 200k to beat out perdue, and the majority of those absentee ballots are dem, then if ostrich gets 300k more absentee ballots over the next month, perdue is practically fucked, because as I show in my previous post, it's likely that young voters will gotv in bulk on top of these absentee numbers as well. This is assuming that the in person voting ratios remain constant.


Timeline:

December 19 is when absentee ballots close for georgia. The hedge funds will most likely learn about these numbers ahead of time, so I'm guessing we're gonna see things start to get sour in a way that coincides with covid fud, so likely Dec 7 is when you should start considering selling for tax gains on anything outside of the upside plays that involve blue wave legislation. If the absentee numbers look bad on december 19, I'm getting the fuck out before the slow funds start selling off for end of month

Hope this helps, if you see anything that's wrong speak up to help autists make tendies


edit: also, just to keep in mind, upside might get fucked if the numbers start looking heavily republican, because probably a lot of the other autists out there were thinking along the same lines when I made the first post, and if the assumptions change, then people will start pulling out_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Take Reddit public via a SPAC, PIPE led by WSB Whos in?_END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ PLTR update- 202.56M PLTR stocks traded today(that's insane and likely fuelled by Institutional players) This is a sign that the stock is being bought not just by retail investors but also by institutional investors.

I've been an index man my whole life and done just fine. Picked a couple stocks occasionally but a couple stocks here and there doesn't make you any money so I quit it. Just recently I decided to get back into picking stocks when I started hearing abount Robinhood all the time, going for some growth/all or nothing plays. I can afford to lose a little money and I had low expectations. Well that was also the same time that I started seeing some WSB posts hit the front page. I had no fucking clue what I was laughing at but I was laughing. WSB memes are a gateway drug. 


$2,500 into RH. Bought WRK shares - a cardboard play - everyone is buying online, there is cardboard all over my house and all over my office. They were underperforming peers, got hit with the COVID, and the five of 10 bullets I read in their 10 point or whatever COVID recovery plan seemed good enough. Solid DD. Went in on Mercado Libre. Boring but solid growth. 


After laughing at all you degenerate fucks for a few months I thought to myself, yeah I should buy an option, without doing any research whatsoever. It's one option MIchael, how much could it cost? I purchased my first option. WRK $45C 12/18. Immediately went red. Didn't care. I needed more. First I had to figure out what the fuck an option was and figure out a better strategy. I knew I was ready when I could finally understand the shitposts. God damn I laugh my ass off reading this sub. And not just a little huff through the nose, like actual laughing. Joy I haven't felt in so long. 


I kept losing more on FDs. I didn't even know what an FD was. I just looked that up yesterday, but apparently that's what I was doing and I am the reason it's called an FD. In bed I would just look at who had earnings coming up and buy calls. I was getting fucked by my stupid plays. V, ACTI, ADM (what the fuck is that even? Bunch of soy bean farms. Who cares???), IP (more fucking cardboard). These stocks are not going to move. Just chipping away at my nut but I was expecting to lose so keep going right? Truly retarted. 


Then who came along? NIO. Fucking NIO. Made some money on calls while it was going from 20>30. Made back my losses and then some. Now I'm main lining heroin. Well shit now I know wtf to do right? Just do whatever WSB is doing. Now I'm staring at RH at work for 30 minutes straight thinking about selling one contract and reading posts on the shitter. Made money on CRSR. Made money on SOLO in the brief period it was popular and killed it on that trade. Now PLTR is fucking gold. I've bought and sold FDs. I'm in on a LEAP. I'm in for stock. TOüöÄ. THEüöÄ. MOON. üöÄ


Now I can't sleep sometimes thinking about my plays that day and the plays I have to monitor the next day. I spend all the god damn zoom meetings I'm in all day staring at tickers. This should not be happening given the amount of money I'm playing with. I've got no positions worth more than a couple hundred bucks. I'm losing sleep over missing out on $20. SO FUCK YOU. BUT ALSO THANKS FOR MAKING ME MONEY, GETTING ME TO LEARN SOME NEW STUFF, FEELING LIKE PART OF THE GANG, AND MOSTLY MAKING ME LAUGH. In 48 days I'm up 75% thanks to WSB (mostly PLTR). I'm going to keep building this nut a bit then YOLO that bitch into a TESLA on whatever meme stock comes next.


There was a post a few weeks ago about people making fancy posts to pump stocks and leaving my retard self holding the bag. Well fuck that. If your DD has bold, paragraphs, some üöÄüöÄüöÄ, and a position then I'm 100% in.


Positions:

GME $15c 11/27

WRK $45c 12/18

ACTI $100c 1/15/21 (stupid)

In the spirit of the giving season that's seemingly spreading here faster than the 'rona, I'd like to celebrate the new ETF that looks oddly enough like it was made especially for / because of us.  For those of you still in the dark, I'm talking about $MOON.

$MOON is the Direxion Moonshot Innovators ETF that tracks the S&P Kensho Moonshots Index.  The S&P Kensho Moonshots Index is designed to measure the performance of 50 U.S.-listed companies with the highest Early-Stage Composite Innovation Score, subject to market capitalization and liquidity criteria, that produce the products and services shaping our future.  Basically, it's a YOLO ETF.  Holdings can be found [here](https://www.direxion.com/product/moonshot-innovators-etf).  Looking at those holdings, if you feel targeted, good, because you are.

Anyway, onto the giveaway!

**If $MOON goes to the moon & closes at or above $40/share on 12/31/20**, 1 lucky commenter will receive a new gaming PC valued around $1,000.  Currently, the front runner is the [Skytech Shiva](https://www.amazon.com/SkyTech-Shiva-Gaming-Computer-Desktop/dp/B07RPCG8ZW/), but I'll ultimately select a highly rated gaming PC with relatively good specs.

**If $MOON goes to Mars & closes at or above $50/share on 12/31/20**, 2 lucky commenters will receive either the previously mentioned gaming PC or a complete [Valve Index VR Kit](https://store.steampowered.com/sub/354231/).  If both winners want the gaming PC, OK.  If both winners want the Valve Index VR kit, OK.  I'm not going to force 1 winner to take 1 prize and the other winner to take the other prize.

**If $MOON goes to Alpha Centauri & closes at or above $60/share on 12/31/20**, 3 lucky commenters will receive either the previously mentioned gaming PC or Valve Index VR kit, or a [$1,000 Lovehoney gift certificate](https://www.lovehoney.com/giftvoucher-purchase).  No kink shame; do with it what you will.  Once again, each winner will get to pick any of the 3 different prizes they want.

**How do you enter?**  Comment a top comment; simple as that.

**How do you win?**  Winners will be randomly selected after 4 PM EST 12/31/20 via [RedditRaffler](https://www.redditraffler.com/).  This post will be edited with a link to drawing results.

**What do you do if you win?**  Message me if I don't message you.  At the very least I'll need an address to ship to.

Since we have the attention span of a gnat, we need to find the next meme stonk. Enter Bill Gates, Butterfly Networks, and Long View Acquisition Corp.

What is it? Butterfly networks primary product is backed by Bill Gates (former second richest man on Earth) and is a handheld ultra sound machine that will improve medical diagnosis capabilities in the US and around the World.

How much does it cost?  The primary ultra sound machine has multiple packages but the best plan costs 3K one time cost that gets you the machine and the subscriptions service. They also have other plans that are based on a yearly subscription (not relevant for math purposes later). 

Company Basics. The company has $64.5M in revenue per year and has several competitors, none of which are backed by Bill Gates. The company is 9 years old and has received $350M in funding. They are merging with LGVW via a SPAC deal like so many companies this year and they have an actual product (looking at the incestuous loser Trevor Milton).

Why you should give a Fuck? Were going to mess around with some math (google research) to show how much money this company could make.

* There are 6,146 hospitals in the United States
* There are 230,187 private practices in the US
* There are an additional 164,500 hospitals world wide
   * Including 69,000 hospitals in India
   * and 30,000 hospitals in China

My sister is a nurse and she says that this is "the coolest shit ever, but it will get lost easily" so that means hospitals will be all about this shit and potentially have to buy more units when it gets lost in the anal probe repository. In other words, the tech itself is legit and this makes doctors/nurses/technicians lives easier. Lets do some numbers.

* Now, the average hospital (sister knowledge) has between 5-20 ultrasound machines floating threw a hospital.
   * If every hospital in the US had 5 machines that's $92M in revenue
* There's an additional 230K private practices in the United States
   * If each private practice had 1 machine, that's $690M
* Now, lets talk about international
   * There's estimated to be 164,500 hospitals worldwide which adds up to an additional $493M
   * Additionally, Doctors, missions, nonprofits, and other organizations could buy one pushing the market even higher by millions.

Simply put, this is an absolute cash cow in the making with the deal expected to close in Q1 of next year. All told the shitty end of my retard math estimates $1.275B in revenue on the low end and an even higher TAM. That doesn't even price in the retard strength when the WSB/robinhood hedge funds start getting involved and fucking around with it. LGVW closed at 17.39 with another 1% gain in aftermarket trading. Given the SPAC craze on the market, LGVW should have no problem heading towards the moon over the next few months.

Positions: Long LGVW with 263 shares, will buy more as capital becomes available.

**TL;DR Buy LGVW shares and calls. Bill Gates backs this company and he knows a thing or two about money. Their technology and capabilities are legit and its the ground floor of a fturistic med tech company. Buy before it becomes a meme.

Anyway, we haven't seen them all week, since they're in deep hiding, triple guessing their life's choices rn.

Just wanted to remind everyone that possibly in a week or two, if PLTR actually see a very small red day, any speck of red, even 0.04%, we will see hundreds of threads an hour from all the bearrorists, screaming as loud as they can about "HAHA FUCKING DUMBASSES BULLS, I TOLD YOU PLTR WOULD COME CRASHING?$@#& SOON, WHO'S FUCKED NOW BULLS HAHA WHERE IS YOUR PLTR NOW?" just like when TSLA dipped a little bit a couple months ago (yea I know, hard to believe, but it was dipping for a day or two). That shit was so annoying, and this time won't be any different. 

When they come out to celebrate the only red day of the month, most of us will be busy on the phone ordering our new tesla, some their new pink lambo.

Again, I know it's gonna be very cringe to see all those fucking bearrorist posts, thinking they're hurting our feelings, while in the meantime we're only annoyed because we can't count our profits quickly enough because of all their constant shitposts.

What are the chances of it actually going bust? 

What are the chances a bear market would wipe it out, the Financial crisis didn‚Äôt wipe out QQQ, despite the  market taking years to recover. Even the dot com bubble didn‚Äôt wipe out QQQ. I know they are both different, but both leveraged. 

Why does everyone hate them? 
If you can handle risk, it seems like they have greater upside than downside over the long term. Somebody help me understand please.

And if you are going to comment about volatility decay, just don‚Äôt bother because these still outperform the market.

Basically im betting Tesla will bounce off the 580-600 range over the next three days. 

PLTR will end up at $35 by Monday/Tuesday if volume holds. 

BLNK doesn't have the volume to sustain its price so I think it will end up at $15-12 by December 7th or so._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ GME investors be like... _END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Forget about PLTR...buy LGVW When the world has moved onto something bigger and better, and PLTR is back to $15 a share, don‚Äôt be left behind.

1) Someone here gives away a PS5 when PLTR hits a multiple of $10

3)  PS5-winners give away another PS5 to pay it forward next time PLT goes up $10.
