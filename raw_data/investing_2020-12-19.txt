 ICLN vs EDGE.TO? My future long term volatile portfolio composition:

5% viu - 0.23% mer
5% vee - 0.24% mer
30% vun - 0.15% mer
30% hxq - 0.28% mer
10% arkk - 0.75% mer
10% rit.to - 0.75% mer
10% icln - 0.46% mer

I'm thinking should I switch out ICLN to EDGE as it's more diversed in terms of sectors (7 broad sectors) and has a lower MER of 0.4%, in addition to being traded in CAD.

I’m a fan of the company, the products, and Elon. I think everyone agrees they are the market leader and will continue to lead the way in the EV arena for the foreseeable future.

Your chairman of Virgin Galactic Go to the “All-in Podcast” on YouTube and go 5 minutes in and watch Chamath’s response.

The biggest concern to me now is Chamaths behaviour.  Watch how he acts when he is asked about selling his 4 million shares.  He says nothing positive about Virgin Galactic.  Literally the guy asking him the question has to say “and you still own a significant owner of the business and you believe in the business”

Even then, says nothing positive about the business.  He seemed very uncomfortable 

Why hasn’t he publicly talked about Virgin Galactic?  The only time he does was when he’s selling shares.

I’m not an advocate for market timing nor am I an advocate for stock picking but I feel like we need this. Too many people are feeling regret for not buying a certain stock or selling off too early! This is despite the fact the stock could’ve just as easily gone down (long term) as many have, after purchase because nobody knows the future. They forget their reasons which must’ve been in line with their risk tolerance and the information they had at the time.

Having said that, what stocks were you on the verge of buying and then decided against, which proceeded to tank?

I know how to do the math on interest vs expected returns over the loan period, but I'm having trouble with a reasonable way to estimate future returns.

Questions-

1)  I'm well aware nothing can predict the future, but are there any indicators I can look at to estimate expected future returns over a 5 or 10 year period?

Hi, as someone interested in investing but with limited time I have been looking into some subscription services which provide market/stock/industry analysis. I was wondering what people here recommend, if anything. 

I know that you can't expect a subscription service to invest for you as free money, and you have to do your own due diligence when investing. However I can still see the value in paying for a service that compiles and analyses crucial information relevant to investment decisions for you in an easy to digest way. 

Some of the possible services I have looked into are: 

* Motley fool stock advisor - this service seems to recommend stocks with a much higher return than the S&P 500. It's clear they beat the market for the past 20 years, but I'm wondering how much analysis and insight they provide for subscribers too. Do they just expect people to take their 2 stock picks a month advice without much analysis and balanced information presented? Do they do any analysis into the fundamentals of companies and industries? Is there service worth much more than just getting 2 stock recommendations a month? 
* Atom - I have just started their free trial today and it looks a lot more hands off. It seems to me like there isn't any analysis done by the company. Does anyone find this type of interface helpful? 
* Zack's - From what I can tell this seems to have an nice amount of actual synthesized analysis, alongside a more open selection of recommendations
* Morningstar - they seem to be very focused on the analysis side and less on the recommendations side, I'd be interested to know more about the type of analysis they provide. They seem quite a bit pricier too. 

Would be interested to hear anyone's experiences with services such as the above._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Dark pools. What are they!? Hello,

Had some free time today so I ran some numbers on IPOs.

**Assumptions of the data / disclosures:**

\- Survivorship bias (companies that did not make it are not included)

\- Removed companies for which no data was available in BBG (i.e. IPO date, offering size, etc.)

\- Some data points are missing and I have left them blank

\- Did not verify the data much and relied purely on figures from BBG so take what you will

\- Offering size is not adjusted for inflation and reflects purely the amount at that specific point in time

**What the data includes:**

\- 1556 IPOs with the earliest dating back to 1919.

\- Current Mkt Cap, IPO Date, IPO Share Price, IPO Offering Size, 1st Open / IPO Offer Price (Column H in ALL HISTORY sheet).

**Some interesting stats:**

\- ABNB, DASH, SNOW & BEKE (all 2020) are the only IPOs that have had an offering size of > $2B and a 1st open at 75% greater than the offer price.

\- There were at least 16 IPOs in 2020 which opened at 100% greater than the offer price. Next closest was 1999 which has 6 companies.

\- There were at least 50 IPOs in 2020 which opened at 50% greater than the offer price. Next closest was 1999 at 10 companies.

I'm particularly interested in the case where one isn't a national in either the US or any country in Asia.

Currently my thoughts are that if one wanted to shield their investments from politically minded legislation one may be better off opening an account with a firm like IB and purchasing securities on the HKEX or SSE. 

I would expect currency exchange to be more of a headache and for there to be additional tax implications. Maybe there are some other considerations I'm also missing? Do let me know.

But ultimately I'm wondering if one could meaningfully maintain investments in the region throughout rising geopolitical tensions. Or would sanctions ruin your day almost immediately making your efforts moot? Would a multi-national broker not based in the US be better then? Does such a firm exist? Would IB be required to cease providing brokerage services for non-us citizens? 

And just to nip some things in the bud:

* I don't mean to express any opinion on the current legislation being passed in the US. I understand why it's reasonable to want to hold Chinese Companies to the same audit standards as their peers on US exchanges. I understand how this legislation can protect investors assets from dubious accounting practices like Luckin Coffee. This is merely considering the hypothetical where tensions were to rise to the point that a US administration would consider putting pressure on China by limiting investment._END_OF_POST_PYSTOCK_ Daily Advice Thread - All basic help or advice questions must be posted here.

Hope you are all keeping well in the current environment. 

I am hoping if someone or Reddit Investing community can guide me on portfolio construction. 

I want to see if there are available white papers, books worth reading, or web links that can provide insight on today's (current market regime) portfolio construction strategies. 
So, 1) what strategies are applied to the current market regime? 
2) Do people still text book strategies  like MVO but tweak it - if so, what's been tweaked/changed? 

I appreciate all shops have their own strategies and sometimes they are not available publicly. But, I want to start learning about the basics and learn how portfolio construction has evolved (if it has) in the past decade. 

One final thing question: is it fair to say that - shops have a number portfolio construction strategies to adapt to different market environments? in a risk on market you have - max risk on let's MVO with a bunch of constraints, risk off you min risk + constraints etc?

But there’s a second argument to made that by these subsidiaries spinning off gives you early access to a stock like Instagram, or YouTube, or Twitch, maybe even AWS or WhatsApp. It makes these stocks more appealing in my opinion for the long term investor.

These are the companies he bought. So you can judge whether or not they're mostly long term  (\~5-10 year holds), or pump and dump stocks. I'm not subscribed to MF myself.

My main question is when do most highly successful people stop investing, or better yet begin to withdrawal the profit that they have made in the stock market? I see them living these expensive lifestyles and having made most of their money in the stock market, are they just not reinvesting their profits into the market and instead using it on their nice house, boat, etc.?

I've spent some time getting my head around it, doing market concepts, generally finding new functions etc. But this is really where my questions start - I'm looking to develop my trading skills as i'm seeking a career in trading post university (unsure if S&T or Prop/oil currently), so I recognize having practical experience in the terminal would be beneficial.
